[Verse 1] 
I will bless the Lord forever I will trust Him at all times He has delivered me from all fear He has set my feet upon a rock I will not be moved And I'll say of the Lord


[Verse 2] 
You are my shield my strength My portion deliverer My shelter strong tower My very present help in time of need


[Verse 3] 
Whom have I in heaven but You There's none I desire besides You You have made me glad and I'll say of the Lord
