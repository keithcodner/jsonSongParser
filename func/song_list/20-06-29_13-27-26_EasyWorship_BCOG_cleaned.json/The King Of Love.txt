[Verse 1] 
The King of love my Shepherd is, Whose goodness faileth never; I nothing lack if I am His, And He is mine forever.


[Verse 2] 
Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul He leadeth; And where the verdant pastures grow, With food celestial feedeth.


[Verse 3] 
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed But yet in love He sought me. And on His shoulder gently laid, And home rejoicing brought me.


[Verse 4] 
In death's dark vale I fear no ill With Thee, dear Lord beside me; Thy rod and staff my comfort still, Thy cross before to guide me.


[Verse 5] 
And so through all the length of days, Thy goodness faileth never. Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise, Within Thy house forever.
