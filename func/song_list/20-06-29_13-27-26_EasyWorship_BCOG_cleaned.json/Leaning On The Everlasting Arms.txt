[Verse 1] 
Leaning, leaning, Safe and secure from all alarms; Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 2] 
What a fellowship, what a joy divine, Leaning on the everlasting arms! What a blessedness, what a peace is mine, Leaning on the everlasting arms!


[Verse 3] 
Oh how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way, Leaning on the everlasting arms! Oh how bright the path Grows from day to day, Leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 4] 
What have I to dread, what have I to fear, Leaning on the everlasting arms? I have blessed peace with my Lord so near, Leaning on the everlasting arms.
