[Verse 1] 
God is working, He’s still working God is working even now Through we often don’t know just how God is working, He’s still working God is working even now


[Verse 2] 
Though you cannot see And you can’t quite understand Remember God is still in control He has promised not to leave us somehow God is working even now


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah, He’s working even now (2X)


[Verse 4] 
Through we often don’t know just how God is working, He’s still working God is working even now
