[Verse 1] 
Wonderful, wonderful, Marvelous and wonderful What He has done for my soul! The half has never been told Oh, it is wonderful. It is marvelous and wonderful What Jesus has done for this soul of mine! The half has never been told.


[Verse 2] 
The Savior has come in His mighty power, And spoken peace to my soul. And all of my life from that very hour, I've yielded to His control. I've yielded to His control.


[Verse 3] 
'Twas only a foretaste of joys divine In Canaan waiting for me; Where sweetest honey and milk and wine Were dripping from ev'ry tree Were dripping from ev'ry tree.


[Verse 4] 
From glory to glory He leads me on From grace to grace ev'ry day; And brighter and brighter the glory dawns While pressing my homeward way While pressing my homeward way.


[Verse 5] 
If fellowship here with my Lord can be So inexpressibly sweet Oh, what will it be when His face we see When 'round the white throne we meet. When 'round the white throne we meet.
