[Verse 1] 
Above all powers, Above all kings Above all nature and all created things Above all wisdom And all the ways of man You were here before the world began


[Verse 2] 
Above all kingdoms Above all thrones Above all wonders the world has ever known Above all wealth And treasures of the earth There's no way to measure what you're worth


[Verse 3] 
Crucified Laid behind a stone You lived to die Rejected and alone


[Verse 4] 
Like a rose Trampled on the ground You took the fall And thought of me Above all


[Verse 5] 
End You took the fall And thought of me Above all
