[Verse 1] 
Hide me now under Your wing Cover me within Your mighty hand


[Verse 2] 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar I will soar with You above the storm Father You are King over the flood I will be still and know You are God


[Verse 3] 
Find rest my soul in Christ alone Know His power in quietness and trust
