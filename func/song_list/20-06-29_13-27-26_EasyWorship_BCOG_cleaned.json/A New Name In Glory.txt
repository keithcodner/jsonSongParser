[Verse 1] 
There's a new name Written down in glory, And it's mine. O yes, it's mine! And the white-robed Angels sing the story, "A sinner has come home."


[Verse 2] 
For there's a new name Written down in glory, And it's mine, O yes it's mine. With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven, Nevermore to roam.


[Verse 3] 
I was once a sinner, but I came Pardon to receive from my Lord. This was freely given, and I found That He always kept His word.


[Verse 4] 
I was humbly kneeling at the Cross, Fearing naught but God's angry frown, When the heavens opened and I saw That my name was written down.


[Verse 5] 
In the Book 'tis written "Saved by grace." O the joy that came to my soul! Now I am forgiven and I know, By the blood I am made whole.
