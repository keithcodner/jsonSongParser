[Verse 1] 
Great is Thy faithfulness o God my Father There is no shadow of turning with Thee Thou changest not Thy compassions they fail not As Thou hast been Thou forever will be


[Verse 2] 
Great is Thy faithfulness Great is Thy faithfulness Morning by morning new mercies I see All I have needed thy hands have provided Great is thy faithfulness Lord unto me


[Verse 3] 
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow Blessings all mine with ten thousands besides


[Verse 4] 
Summer and winter and springtime and harvest Sun moon and stars in their courses above Join with all nature in manifold witness To Thy great faithfulness mercy and love
