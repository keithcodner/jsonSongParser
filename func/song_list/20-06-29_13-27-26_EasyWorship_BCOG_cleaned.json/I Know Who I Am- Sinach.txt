[Verse 1] 
We are a chosen generation Called forth to show His excellence All I required for life God has given me And I know who I am


[Verse 2] 
I know who God says I am What He says I am Where He says I'm at I know who I am


[Verse 3] 
I'm walking in power I'm working miracles I live a life of favor Cause I know who I am


[Verse 4] 
Ohh oh oh, oh oh oh I know who I am


[Verse 5] 
I am holy I am righteous oh... I am so rich I am beautiful


[Verse 6] 
I'm walking in power I'm working miracles I live a life of favor Cause I know who I am


[Verse 7] 
Take a look at me I'm a wonder It doesn't matter what you see now Can you see His glory 'Cause I know who I am
