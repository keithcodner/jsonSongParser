[Verse 1] 
Have thine own way Lord Have thine own way Though art the potter, I am the clay


[Verse 2] 
Have thine own way Lord Have thine own way Search me and try me, Mas-ter, to-day


[Verse 3] 
Have thine own way Lord Have thine own way Wounded and wea-ry, help me I pray


[Verse 4] 
Have thine own way Lord Have thine own way Hold o 'er my be-ing ab-so-lute sway


[Verse 5] 
Mold me and make me, after thy will I am waiting , Yeilding and still


[Verse 6] 
Whit-er than snow, Lord, wash me just now, as in thy presence humbly i bow


[Verse 7] 
Pow-er all pow-er, surely is thine, Touch me and heal me, Sav-ior di-vine


[Verse 8] 
Fill with thy Spir-it, Till all shall see, Christ on-ly, al-ways, living in me
