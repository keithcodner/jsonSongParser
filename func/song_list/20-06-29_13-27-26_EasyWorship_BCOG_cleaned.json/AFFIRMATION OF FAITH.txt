[Verse 1] 
Upon the authority of your Word, I have given, And it shall be given unto me, Press down, shaken together and running over


[Verse 2] 
I am a tither; I bring my tithe today into your store house


[Verse 3] 
Therefore the enemy is rebuked The Curse is broken


[Verse 4] 
I live under an open heaven You pour out upon me such a Blessing That there is not enough room to receive We receive jobs and better jobs


[Verse 5] 
Raises and bonuses, Sales and commissions, Benefits and settlements, Estates and inheritance, Interest and income, Rebate and returns,


[Verse 6] 
Cheques in the mail, Gifts and surprises, Bills paid off, Debts demolished, Royalties received


[Verse 7] 
My whole family saved and walking with God; Perfect health and abundance To walk in divine favour and blessing, I am blessed going in and blessed going out


[Verse 8] 
All that I do will prosper, In Jesus name. Amen.
