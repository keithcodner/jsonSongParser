[Verse 1] 
Savior, like a shepherd lead us; Much we need Your tender care. In Your pleasant pastures feed us, For our use Your folds prepare. Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus, You have bought us: Yours we are.


[Verse 2] 
We are Yours; in love befriend us, Be the guardian of our way; Keep Your flock, from sin defend us, Seek us when we go astray. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Hear Your children when we pray.


[Verse 3] 
You have promised to receive us, Poor and sinful though we be; You have mercy to relieve us, Grace to cleanse, and power to free. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Early let us turn to You.


[Verse 4] 
Early let us seek Your favor, Early let us do Your will; Blessed Lord and only Savior, With Your love our spirits fill. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, You have loved us; love us still.
