[Verse 1] 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way, Oh what fun it is to ride, In a one horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way, Oh what fun it is to ride, In a one horse open sleigh.


[Verse 2] 
Dashing through the snow, In a one horse open sleigh, O'er the fields we go, Laughing all the way, Bells on bobtail ring, Making spirits bright. What fun it is to ride and sing, A sleighing song tonight.


[Verse 3] 
Ring the bells, ring the bells Ring them out today. Echoing through all the world Listen what they say Ring the bells, ring the bells Ring them all the way. Spread the message far and wide That Christ is born today.
