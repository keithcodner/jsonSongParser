[Verse 1] 
Everyone arise and let it shine Children of our God Your light has come For the glory of the Lord And beauty of His grace Is rising on you now


[Verse 2] 
Though the darkness covers All the earth They will see Your light They will hear Your sound For the glory of the Lord And beauty of His grace Is rising on you now


[Verse 3] 
Praise Him praise Him praise Him Arise and shine and celebrate Him Praise Him praise Him praise Him Let His glory rise on you


[Verse 4] 
And praise Him praise Him praise Him Arise and shine and celebrate Him Praise Him praise Him praise Him Let His glory rise on you Let it rise


[Verse 5] 
There's just something so right About lifting His name on high It brings us joy And peace of mind When we give our lives To glorify Him so
