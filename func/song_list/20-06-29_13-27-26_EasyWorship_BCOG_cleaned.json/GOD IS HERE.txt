[Verse 1] 
There is a sweet anointing in the sanctuary There is a stillness in the atmosphere Come and lay down the burdens you have carried For in the sanctuary, God is here


[Verse 2] 
He is here, He is here To break the yoke And lift the heavy burdens He is here He is here To heal the hopeless hearts and bless the broken


[Verse 3] 
So come lay down The burdens you have carried For in the sanctuary God is here
