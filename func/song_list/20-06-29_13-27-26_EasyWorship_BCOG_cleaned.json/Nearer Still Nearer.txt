[Verse 1] 
Nearer, still nearer Close to Thy heart, Draw me, my Savior So precious Thou art! Fold me oh fold me To Thy breast, Shelter me safe In that "Haven of Rest"; Shelter me safe In that "Haven of Rest."


[Verse 2] 
Nearer, still nearer Nothing I bring, Naught as an offering To Jesus, my King; Only my sinful, Now contrite heart. Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart, Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.


[Verse 3] 
Nearer, still nearer While life shall last, Till safe in glory My anchor is cast; Through endless ages ever to be, Nearer, my Savior Still nearer to Thee, Nearer my Savior Still nearer to Thee.


[Verse 4] 
Nearer, still nearer Lord to be Thine! Sin with its follies I gladly resign, All of its pleasures, Pomp and its pride. Give me but Jesus My Lord crucified; Give me but Jesus My Lord crucified.
