[Verse 1] 
Glory hallelujah I shall not be moved Anchored in Jehovah I shall not be moved


[Verse 2] 
Just like a tree That's planted by the water I shall not be moved


[Verse 3] 
I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be moved Just like a tree That's planted by the water I shall not be moved


[Verse 4] 
In His love abiding I shall not be moved And in Him confiding I shall not be moved


[Verse 5] 
Tho' all hell assail me I shall not be moved Jesus will not fail me I shall not be moved


[Verse 6] 
Tho' the tempst rages I shall not be moved On the rock of ages I shall not be moved
