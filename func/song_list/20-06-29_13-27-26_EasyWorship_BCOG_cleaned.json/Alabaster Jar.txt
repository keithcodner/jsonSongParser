[Verse 1] 
The alabaster jar is all i have of worth I break it at your fee, Lord it's less than you deserve You're far more beautiful, more precious than the oil The sum of my desires and the fullness of my joy Like you spilled your blood, i spill my heart As an offering to my king


[Verse 2] 
Here i am, take me as an offering Here i am, giving every heartbeat for your glory Take me


[Verse 3] 
The time that i have left is all i have of worth I lay it at your feet, Lord, it's less than you deserve And though i've little strength, and though my days are few You gave your life for me so i will live my life for you Like you spilled your blood, i spill my heart as an offering to my king


[Verse 4] 
Here i am, take me as an offering Here i am, giving every heartbeat for your glory Here i am, take me as an offering Here i am, giving every heartbeat for your glory


[Verse 5] 
Worthy, Worthy You are worthy, worthy is the Lord
