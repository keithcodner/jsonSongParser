[Verse 1] 
There is a sweet anointing in the sanctuary There is a stillness in the atmosphere


[Verse 2] 
Come and lay down The burdens you have carried For in the sanctuary God is here


[Verse 3] 
He is here He is here To break the yoke and lift your heavy burden


[Verse 4] 
He is here He is here To heal the hopeless heart and bless the broken


[Verse 5] 
Come and lay down The burdens you have carried For in the sanctuary God is here
