[Verse 1] 
The splendor of the King Clothed in Majesty Let all the earth rejoice Let all the earth rejoice


[Verse 2] 
He wraps Himself in light As darkness tries to hide It trembles at His voice Trembles at His voice


[Verse 3] 
How great is our God Sing with me How great is our God And all will see How great How great is our God


[Verse 4] 
Name above all names You are worthy of our praise And my heart will sing How great is our God


[Verse 5] 
From age to age He stands And time is in His hand Beginning and the end Beginning and the end


[Verse 6] 
The Godhead three in one Father, Spirit, Son The Lion and the Lamb The Lion and the Lamb
