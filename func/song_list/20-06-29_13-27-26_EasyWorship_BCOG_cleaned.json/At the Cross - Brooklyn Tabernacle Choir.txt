[Verse 1] 
Jesus came and love me Took my sin to calv'ry He has made a way for me And now my eyes are open Since i've to come to know him His great love has set me free


[Verse 2] 
At the cross my debt was paid All my sins were washed away Just for me, amazing grace, At the cross At the cross my savior died Shed his blood, was crucified Just for me he gave his life, At the cross


[Verse 3] 
My joy will ever be In the one who saved me Jesus, lamb of calvary All praises to the King For his grace and mercy I have been redeemed


[Verse 4] 
At the cross my debt was paid All my sins were washed away Just for me, amazing grace, At the cross At the cross my savior died Shed his bloond, was crucified Just for me he gave his life, At the cross
