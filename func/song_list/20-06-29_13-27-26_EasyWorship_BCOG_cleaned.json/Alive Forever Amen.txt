[Verse 1] 
He's alive alive alive Hallelujah alive Praise and glory to the Lamb Alive alive alive hallelujah Alive forever amen


[Verse 2] 
I'm alive alive alive Hallelujah alive Praise and glory to the Lamb Alive alive alive hallelujah Alive forever amen


[Verse 3] 
Let the children sing A song of liberation The God of our salvation Set us free Death where is thy sting The curse of sin is broken The empty tomb stands open Come and see


[Verse 4] 
Let my heart sing out For Christ the One and only So powerful and holy Rescued me Death won't hurt me now Because He has redeemed me No grave will ever keep me From my King


[Verse 5] 
Worthy is the Lamb Worthy of our praise Worthy is the One Who has overcome the grave Let the people dance Let the people sing Worthy is the mighty King


[Verse 6] 
Worthy is the Lamb Worthy of our praise Worthy is the One Who has overcome the grave Let the people dance Let the people sing Worthy is the mighty King
