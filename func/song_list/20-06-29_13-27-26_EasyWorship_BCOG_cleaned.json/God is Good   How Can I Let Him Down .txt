[Verse 1] 
God is good, God is good God is good to me How could I let him down How could I let him down How could I let him down He is so good to me


[Verse 2] 
He save my soul He made me whole He save my soul from hell How could I let him down How could I let him down How could I let him down He is so good to me


[Verse 3] 
He picked me up Turned me around Place my feet on higher ground How could I let him down How could I let him down He is so good to me
