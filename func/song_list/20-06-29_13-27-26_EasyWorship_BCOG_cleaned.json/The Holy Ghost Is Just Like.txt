[Verse 1] 
The Holy Ghost is just like a dynamite


[Verse 2] 
BOOM


[Verse 3] 
Falling here Falling there Falling falling everywhere


[Verse 4] 
The Holy Ghost is just like a dynamite


[Verse 5] 
The Holy Ghost power is moving just like a magnet


[Verse 6] 
Moving here Moving there Just like the day of Pentecost


[Verse 7] 
The Holy Ghost power is moving just like a magnet
