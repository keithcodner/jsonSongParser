[Verse 1] 
I am saved, I've been set free From the chains that held me I am saved I've been set free From the bondage that bound me I am saved, I've been set free From the shackles


[Verse 2] 
In jesus name (2x)


[Verse 3] 
No more weeping, no no no No more hurting, no no no No more suffering, no no no


[Verse 4] 
No more sickness, no no no No more failure, no no no No more pain, no no no


[Verse 5] 
No more oppression, no no no No depression, no no no No stagnation, no no no


[Verse 6] 
Because he took it all away took it all away, to the cross Jesus, he took it all away Took it all away


[Verse 7] 
You saved me
