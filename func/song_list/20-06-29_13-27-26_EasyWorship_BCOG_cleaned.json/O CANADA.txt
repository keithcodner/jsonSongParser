[Verse 1] 
O Canada Our home and native land True patriot love In all thy sons command


[Verse 2] 
With glowing hearts we see thee rise The true north, strong and free From far and wide, O Canada We stand on guard for thee


[Verse 3] 
God keep our land Glorious and free O Canada We stand on guard for thee O Canada We stand on guard for thee
