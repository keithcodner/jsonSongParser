[Verse 1] 
I will lift my voice To worship You my King I will find my strength In the shadow of Your wings


[Verse 2] 
Your love oh Lord Reaches to the heavens Your faithfulness Stretches to the sky Your righteousness Is like the mighty mountains Your justice flows Like the ocean's tide


[Verse 3] 
Your love O Lord Reaches to the heavens Your faithfulness Stretches to the sky
