[Verse 1] 
When you walk into the room Everything changes Darkness starts to tremble At the light that you bring


[Verse 2] 
When you walk into the room Every heart starts burning Nothing matters more Than just to sit down at your feet and worship you Our father, we worship you


[Verse 3] 
When you walk into the room Everything changes Darkness starts to tremble At the light that you bring


[Verse 4] 
When you walk into the room Every heart starts burning Nothing matters more Than just to sit down at your feet and worship you Oh, yes, we worship you oooh


[Verse 5] 
We love you We'll never stop We can't live without you Jesus We love you Can't get enough All this is for you Jesus


[Verse 6] 
When you walk into the room Sickness starts to vanish And every hopeless situation Ceases to exist


[Verse 7] 
When you walk into the room The dead begin to rise There's resurrection in all that you do


[Verse 8] 
We love you Ooh We'll never stop We can't live without Jesus We love you We can't get enough all this is for you Jesus We love you We'll never stop We can't live without you
