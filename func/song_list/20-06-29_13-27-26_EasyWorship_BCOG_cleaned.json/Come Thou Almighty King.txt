[Verse 1] 
Come, Thou Almighty King. Help us Thy name to sing. Help us to praise. Father, all glorious, O'er all victorious. Come and reign over us, Ancient of Days.


[Verse 2] 
Come, Thou Incarnate Word, Gird on Thy mighty sword, Our prayer attend. Come, and Thy people bless, And give Thy Word success. Spirit of holiness, On us descend.


[Verse 3] 
Come, Holy Comforter, Thy sacred witness bear In this glad hour. Thou who almighty art, Now rule in every heart; And ne'er from us depart, Spirit of power.


[Verse 4] 
To the great One in Three Eternal praises be Hence evermore. His sovereign majesty May we in glory see, And to eternity Love and adore.


[Verse 5] 
O Lord, our God, to Thee The highest praises be, Hence, evermore; Thy sov'reign majesty May we in glory see, And to eternity Love and adore.
