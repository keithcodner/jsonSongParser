Here I am Down on my knees again Surrendering all Surrendering all


[Verse 2] 
Find me here Lord as You draw me near Desperate for You Desperate for You


[Verse 3] 
I surrender


[Verse 4] 
Drench my soul As mercy and grace unfold I hunger and thirst I hunger and thirst


[Verse 5] 
With arms stretched wide I know You hear my cry Speak to me now Speak to me now


[Verse 6] 
I surrender I surrender I wanna know You more I wanna know You more


[Verse 7] 
Like a rushing wind Jesus breathe within Lord have Your way Lord have Your way in me


[Verse 8] 
Like a mighty storm Stir within my soul Lord have Your way Lord have Your way in me

Like a rushing wind Jesus breathe within Lord have Your way Lord have Your way in me

Like a mighty storm Stir within my soul Lord have Your way Lord have Your way in me

Like a rushing wind Jesus breathe within Lord have Your way Lord have Your way in me

Like a mighty storm Stir within my soul Lord have Your way Lord have Your way in me
