[Verse 1] 
Away in a manger no crib for a bed; The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head. The stars in the sky looked down where He lay; The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.


[Verse 2] 
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes; But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes. I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky; And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.


[Verse 3] 
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay; Close by me forever and love me I pray. Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care; And take us to heaven to live with Thee there.
