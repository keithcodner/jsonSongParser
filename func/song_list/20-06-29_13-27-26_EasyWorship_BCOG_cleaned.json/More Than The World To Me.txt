[Verse 1] 
Magnificent Glorious Wonderful Holy


[Verse 2] 
You are my hiding place My shelter from the storm Secure in your embrace Protected from all harm You are.... More than the world to me


[Verse 3] 
The lover of my soul The very air I breathe My love, my life, my all More than the world to me You are..... More than the world to me
