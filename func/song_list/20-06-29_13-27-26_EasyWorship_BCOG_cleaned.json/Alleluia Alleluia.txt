[Verse 1] 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Hearts to heaven and voices raise; Sing to God a hymn of gladness, Sing to God a hymn of praise. He who on the cross as Savior, For the world's salvation bled; Jesus Christ, the King of Glory, Now is risen from the dead.


[Verse 2] 
Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born, Glorious life, and life immortal, On this resurrection morn; Christ has triumphed, and we conquer By His mighty enterprise; We with Him to life eternal, By His resurrection rise.
