[Verse 1] 
There's a Peace that floods my soul When the Spirit of the Lord is in control There's a Joy no bounds can hold When the Spirit blows a fresh wind in my soul


[Verse 2] 
Holy Spirit flow through me Touch my heart and there will There will be


[Verse 3] 
Such joy Such unspeakable Joy Such peace Everlasting Peace Such love Pure and holy Love Spirit have Your way in me
