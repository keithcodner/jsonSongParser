[Verse 1] 
O the blood Crimson love Price of life's demand Shameful sin Placed on him The hope of every man


[Verse 2] 
O the blood of Jesus washes me O the blood of Jesus shed for me What a sacrificed that saved my life Yes the blood it is my victory


[Verse 3] 
Savior son Holy one Slain so I can live See the lamb The great I am Who takes away my sin


[Verse 4] 
O the blood of the lamb O the blood of the lamb O the blood of the lamb The precious blood of the lamb


[Verse 5] 
What a sacrifice That saved my life Yes the blood it is my victory


[Verse 6] 
O what love No greater love Grace how can it be That in my sin Yes even then He shed his blood for me


[Verse 7] 
O the blood of the lamb O the blood of the lamb O the blood of the lamb The precious blood of the lamb


[Verse 8] 
What a sacrifice That saved my life Yes the blood it is my victory
