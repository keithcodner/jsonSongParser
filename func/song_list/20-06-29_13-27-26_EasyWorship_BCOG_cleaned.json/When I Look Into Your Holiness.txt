[Verse 1] 
When I look into Your holiness When I gaze into Your loveliness When all things that surround become shadows In the light of You


[Verse 2] 
When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart When my will becomes enthroned in Your love When all things that surround become shadows In the light of You


[Verse 3] 
I worship You I worship You The reason I live Is to worship You
