[Verse 1] 
God moves in a mysterious way His glorious wonders to perform; He plants His footsteps in the sea And rides upon the storm.


[Verse 2] 
Deep in unfathomable mines Of never failing skill He treasures up His bright designs, And works His sovereign will.


[Verse 3] 
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take. The clouds ye so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break, In blessings on your head.


[Verse 4] 
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust Him for His grace; Behind a frowning providence He hides a smiling face.


[Verse 5] 
His purposes will ripen fast, Unfolding every hour: The bud may have a bitter taste But sweet will be the flower.


[Verse 6] 
Blind unbelief is sure to err, And scan His work in vain: God is His own interpreter, And He will make it plain.
