[Verse 1] 
I sing the mighty power of God, That made the mountains rise; That spread the flowing seas abroad, And built the lofty skies, That spread the flowing seas abroad, And built the lofty skies.


[Verse 2] 
I sing the goodness of the Lord, That filled the earth with food; He formed the creatures with His word, And then pronounced them good, He formed the creatures with His word, And then pronounced them good.


[Verse 3] 
There's not a plant or flower below, But makes Thy glories known; And clouds arise, and tempests blow, By order from Thy throne; And clouds arise, and tempests blow, By order from Thy throne. Amen.
