[Verse 1] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.


[Verse 2] 
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! Heir of salvation, purchase of God, Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood!


[Verse 3] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.


[Verse 4] 
Perfect submission, perfect delight! Visions of rapture now burst at my sight! Angels descending bring from above Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.


[Verse 5] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.


[Verse 6] 
Perfect submission, all is at rest. I in my Savior am happy and blest; Watching and waiting, looking above, Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.


[Verse 7] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.
