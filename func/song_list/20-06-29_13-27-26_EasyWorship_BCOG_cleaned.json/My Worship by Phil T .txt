[Verse 1] 
You are, You are worthy And no one can worship You for me For all the things You've done for me And no one can worship You for me


[Verse 2] 
Here's my worship All of my worship Receive my worship All of my worship


[Verse 3] 
And I will not be silent I will always worship You As long as I am breathing I will always worship You


[Verse 4] 
You are, You are worthy
