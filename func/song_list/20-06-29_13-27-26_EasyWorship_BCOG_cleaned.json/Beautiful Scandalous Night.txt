[Verse 1] 
At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree On that beautiful scandalous night You and me were atoned by His blood And forever washed white On that beautiful scandalous night


[Verse 2] 
Go on up to the mountain of mercy To the crimson perpetual tide Kneel down on the shore Be thirsty no more Go under and be purified


[Verse 3] 
Follow Christ to the holy mountain Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall Cleanse your heart and your soul In the fountain that flows For you and for me and for all


[Verse 4] 
On the hillside you will be delivered At the foot of the cross justified And your spirit restored By the river that pours From our blessed Savior's side


[Verse 5] 
You carried the sin of mankind On Your back And the sky went black
