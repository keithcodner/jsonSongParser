[Verse 1] 
On the edge, of a cliff Nothing below but tragedy At the end, of my self Nowhere to go But down from here


[Verse 2] 
I feel the weight I feel the tug Of my sins And gravity keeps pulling me down And I deserve it But Your hand blocked the ground


[Verse 3] 
I fell in looove Fell in looove Fell in looove Fell in looove


[Verse 4] 
What is love? Nothing's right Take a look, no fantasy In my world, in this life Nowhere to go but down from here


[Verse 5] 
I feel the weight I feel the tug (Oho) Of my sin And gravity keeps pulling me down Oh I deserve it But Your hand blocked the ground


[Verse 6] 
I fell in looove I fell in looove Fell in love (Fell in looove) (I fell in Your grace) Fell in looove (I fell in Your mercy) Fell in looove (when I thought it was over) Fell in looove (You stepped on it, You stepped right in) Fell in looove (and Now I am saved ) (I'm grateful Jesus) Fell in looove (Now I am saved)


[Verse 7] 
So glad, no matter what I've gone through No matter what I’ve done , You’ve been consistent God Through it all


[Verse 8] 
Yeah, I’m so glad You hear me now You see me nooow I believe You are still in love with me


[Verse 9] 
Through it all, Yeah You hear me now You see me now (You see me nooow) I believe that You are satisfied with me


[Verse 10] 
(You hear me God, when I call your name) You hear me now (This will be my confidence) (Jesus Jesus) You see me nooow I believe You are still in love with me


[Verse 11] 
You hear me now (You still see me) You see me nooow I believe (And I choose to believe) You are satisfied with me


[Verse 12] 
(And You still hear me) You hear me now (And You still see me) You see me nooow (And I love that You do) I believe You are still in love with me


[Verse 13] 
Fell in looove Fell in looove Nooow I believe You are still in love with me
