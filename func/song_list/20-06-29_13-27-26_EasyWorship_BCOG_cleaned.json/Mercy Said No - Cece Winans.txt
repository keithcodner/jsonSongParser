[Verse 1] 
I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading I was drawn to what I could not understand And for the cause of Christ, I have spent my days believing That what He'd have me be, who I am


[Verse 2] 
As I've come to see the weaker side of me I realize His grace is what I'll need When sin demanded justice for my soul


[Verse 3] 
(Chorus) Mercy said no I'm not going to let you go I'm not going to let you slip away You don't have to be afraid Mercy said no Sin will never take control Life and death stood face to face Darkness tried to steal my heart away Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no


[Verse 4] 
For God so loved the world, that He sent His son to save us From the cross He built a bridge to set us free Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is still a war that rages And makes a sacrifice so hard to see


[Verse 5] 
As midnight fell upon the crucifixion day The light of hope seemed oh so far away As evil tried to stop redemption's flow


[Verse 6] 
(Chorus) Mercy said no I'm not going to let you go I'm not going to let you slip away You don't have to be afraid Mercy said no Sin will never take control Life and death stood face to face Darkness tried to steal my heart away Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no


[Verse 7] 
And now when heaven looks at me It's through the blood of Jesus Reminding me of one day long ago


[Verse 8] 
(Chorus) Mercy said no I'm not going to let you go I'm not going to let you slip away You don't have to be afraid Mercy said no Sin will never take control Life and death stood face to face Darkness tried to steal my heart away Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no
