[Verse 1] 
Who is there Jesus That reigns above you? Who has the power and Wisdom you do?


[Verse 2] 
You rule forever You’re seated on high I fall before you My spirit cries there is


[Verse 3] 
No throne Higher than your throne No kingdom Greater than yours There is no throne Higher than your throne You are Lord


[Verse 4] 
You gaze with love upon All hearts of faith You show such mercy Compassion and grace


[Verse 5] 
Yet there’s perfect justice at Your judgement seat All kings and nations are Under your feet there is


[Verse 6] 
Lord of all Lords King of all Kings Now and forever the universe sings Lord of all Lords King of all Kings With all creation your children sing
