[Verse 1] 
Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise For it was grace, that brought my liberty Iâ€™ll never know just why He came to love me so He looked beyond my faults and saw my need


[Verse 2] 
I shall forever lift my eyes to Calvary To view the cross where Jesus died for me How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul He looked beyond my faults and saw my need.


[Verse 3] 
How marvelous the grace that caught my falling soul He looked beyond my fault He looked beyond my fault He looked beyond my fault And saw my need He saw my need
