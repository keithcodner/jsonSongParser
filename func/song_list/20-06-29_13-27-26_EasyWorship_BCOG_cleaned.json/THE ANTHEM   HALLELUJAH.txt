[Verse 1] 
Hallelujah You have won the victory Hallelujah You have won it all for me

By his stripes we are healed By his nail pierced hands we're free By his blood we're washed clean Now we have the victory

The power of sin is broken Jesus overcame it all He has won our freedom Jesus has won it all

Hallelujah, You have won the victory Hallelujah, You have won it all for me
