[Verse 1] 
Praise my soul, the King of heaven; To His feet thy tribute bring; Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Evermore His praises sing: Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise the everlasting King!


[Verse 2] 
Praise Him for His grace and favor To our fathers in distress. Praise Him, still the same forever. Slow to chide and swift to bless: Alleluia! Alleluia! Glorious in His faithfulness!


[Verse 3] 
Father-like He tends and spares us. Well our feeble frame He knows; In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes: Alleluia! Alleluia! Widely yet His mercy flows!


[Verse 4] 
Angels in the height, adore Him, Ye behold Him face to face; Sun and moon, bow down before Him, Dwellers all in time and space: Alleluia! Alleluia! Praise with us the God of grace!


[Verse 5] 
Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish; Blows the wind and it is gone; But, while mortals rise and perish, God endures unchanging on: Praise Him, praise Him, Praise Him, praise Him, Praise with us the God of grace.
