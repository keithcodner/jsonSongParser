[Verse 1] 
Let the people of God say - Yeah


[Verse 2] 
This is the day This is the day That the Lord has made That the Lord has made


[Verse 3] 
I will rejoice I will rejoice And be glad in it Glad in it


[Verse 4] 
This is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it This is the day This is the day That the Lord has made


[Verse 5] 
When I look back over all the years the I made it through Can't imagine where I'd be now if it wasn't for you Why Your favour rests upon me I can never explain


[Verse 6] 
But I'm so glad that I can say I will rejoice
