[Verse 1] 
Latter rain fall again Latter rain fall again Soak me from my head Down to my toes Fall on the young and the old


[Verse 2] 
Soaking wet we come to get soaking wet Soaking wet we come to get soaking wet


[Verse 3] 
Rejoice rejoice Shout and dance Shout and dance for I hear a sound It's the sound of the abundance of rain
