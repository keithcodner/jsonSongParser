[Verse 1] 
There's no place I'd rather be There's no place I'd rather be There's no place I'd rather be Than here in Your love Here in Your love


[Verse 2] 
So set a fire down in my soul That I can't contain And I can't control I want more of You God I want more of You God


[Verse 3] 
So set a fire down in my soul That I can't contain That I can't contain And I can't control We want more of You God We want more of You God
