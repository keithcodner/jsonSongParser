[Verse 1] 
Hungry I come to You for I know You satisfy I am empty but I know Your love does not run dry So I wait for You And so I wait for You


[Verse 2] 
I'm falling on my knees Offering all of me Jesus You're all this heart is living for


[Verse 3] 
Broken I run to You for Your arms are open wide I am weary but I know Your touch restores mt life So I wait for You And so I wait for You
