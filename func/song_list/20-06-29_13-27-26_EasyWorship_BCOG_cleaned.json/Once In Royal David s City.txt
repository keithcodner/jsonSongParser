[Verse 1] 
Once in royal David's city, Stood a lowly cattle shed; Where a mother laid her baby, In a manger for His bed. Mary was that mother mild, Jesus Christ, her little Child.


[Verse 2] 
He came down to earth from heaven, Who is God and Lord of all; And His shelter was a stable, And His cradle was a stall. With the poor and meek and lowly, Lived on earth, our Savior holy.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is our childhood's pattern, Day by day like us He grew; He was little, weak and helpless, Tears and smiles like us He knew. And He feels for all our sadness, And He shares in all our gladness.


[Verse 4] 
And our eyes at last shall see Him, Through His own redeeming love, For that Child so dear and gentle, Is our Lord in heaven above; And He leads His children on, To the place where He has gone.


[Verse 5] 
Not in that poor lowly stable, With the oxen standing by; We shall see Him but in heaven, Set at God's right hand on high. There His children gather round, Bright like stars with glory crowned.


[Verse 6] 
And through all His wondrous childhood He would honor and obey, Love and watch the lowly maiden In whose gentle arms He lay; Christian children, All must be mild, obedient, Good as He.
