[Verse 1] 
For the Lord is my Tower And He gives me the power To tear down the works of the enemy


[Verse 2] 
In a difficult hour He will crush the devourer And bring the power of darkness Underneath my feet


[Verse 3] 
Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be the name of the Lord Most High
