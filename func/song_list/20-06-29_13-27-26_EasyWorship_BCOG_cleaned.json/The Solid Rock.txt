[Verse 1] 
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.


[Verse 2] 
My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus' name.


[Verse 3] 
When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil.


[Verse 4] 
His oath, His covenant, His blood, Support me in the whelming flood. When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my Hope and Stay.


[Verse 5] 
When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found! Dressed in His righteousness alone, Faultless to stand before the throne!
