[Verse 1] 
Shackled by a heavy burden 'neath a load of guilt and shame Then the hand of Jesus touched me And now I am no longer the same


[Verse 2] 
He touched me Oh, He touched me And, oh, the joy that floods my soul Something happened and now I know He touched me and made me whole


[Verse 3] 
Since I've met the Blessed Saviour Since He cleansed and made me whole I will never cease to praise Him I'll shout it while eternity rolls
