[Verse 1] 
Into your arms I'm drawing near again To dwell with you It's my only heart's desire It's my only heart's desire


[Verse 2] 
And all I can do Is fall on my knees and cry Cleanse me with fire And purify my heart


[Verse 3] 
Draw me close Closer than before Closer than I've ever been


[Verse 4] 
Draw me close Closer than before Closer than I've ever been


[Verse 5] 
Into your arms I'm drawing near again To dwell with you


[Verse 6] 
It's my only heart's desire It's my only heart's desire All I can do Is fall on my knees and cry


[Verse 7] 
Cleanse me with fire Purify my heart Draw me Draw me close I wanna be, closer than before Closer than, closer than I've ever been Oh God, hear the cry of your people


[Verse 8] 
Draw me close We wanna be Closer than before Closer than, closer than I've ever been Oh God, oh God


[Verse 9] 
Draw me close Draw me close Closer than before


[Verse 10] 
I wanna be, closer than I've ever been See I'm not satisfied with where I am


[Verse 11] 
Draw me close I wanna be, closer than before Closer than, closer than I've ever been Say draw me close to you God


[Verse 12] 
Draw me close Closer than before We wanna be, closer than I've ever been Oh God, hear the cry of a heart


[Verse 13] 
Draw me close Closer than before Closer than I've ever been


[Verse 14] 
Wrap me in your arms Wrap me in your arms Wrap me in your arms Oh God


[Verse 15] 
Wrap me in your Wrap me in your arms Wrap me in your arms
