[Verse 1] 
I see the King of Glory Coming down the clouds with fire The whole earth shakes The whole earth shakes


[Verse 2] 
I see His love and mercy Washing over all our sin The people sing The people sing


[Verse 3] 
Hosanna, Hosanna Hosanna in the Highest


[Verse 4] 
I see a generation Rising up to take the place With selfless faith With selfless faith


[Verse 5] 
I see a new revival Starting as we pray and seek We're on our knees We're on our knees


[Verse 6] 
Hosanna, Hosanna Hosanna in the Highest


[Verse 7] 
Heal my heart and make it clean Open up my eyes to the things unseen Show me how to love like You have loved me


[Verse 8] 
Break my heart with what breaks Yours Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause As I walk from earth into eternity


[Verse 9] 
Hosanna
