[Verse 1] 
My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus blood and righteousness I dare not trust the sweetest frame But wholly trust in Jesus name


[Verse 2] 
Christ alone Cornerstone Weak made strong in the Saviour's love Through the storm He is Lord Lord of all


[Verse 3] 
When Darkness seems to hide His face I rest on His unchanging grace In every high and stormy gale My anchor holds within the veil My anchor holds within the veil


[Verse 4] 
Christ alone Cornerstone Weak made strong in the Saviour's love Through the storm He is Lord Lord of all


[Verse 5] 
When He shall come with trumpet sound Oh, may I then in Him be found Dressed in His righteousness alone Faultless stand before the throne
