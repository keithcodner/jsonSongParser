[Verse 1] 
Fairest Lord Jesus! Ruler of all nature! O Thou of God and man the Son! Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, Thou, my soul's glory, Joy, and crown.


[Verse 2] 
Fair are the meadows; Fairer still the woodlands, Robed in the blooming Garb of spring. Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer, Who makes the woeful heart to sing.


[Verse 3] 
Fair is the sunshine, Fairer still the moonlight, And all the twinkling, starry host. Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer, Than all the angels Heav'n can boast.


[Verse 4] 
Beautiful Savior! Lord of the nations! Son of God and Son of man! Glory and honor, praise adoration, Now and forevermore be Thine!
