[Verse 1] 
Silver and gold Silver and gold I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold No fame or fortune Nor riches untold I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold


[Verse 2] 
Don't give me a mansion On top of the hill Don't give me the world With a shallow thrill But just give me a savior My life He can hold I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold


[Verse 3] 
I woke up this morning Feeling kind of down I called on my best friend She could not be found But I called on Jesus My life He can hold I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold


[Verse 4] 
For unto us a child is born A son is given I'd rather have Jesus What profits a man to gain the whole world and lose His soul I'd rather have Jesus For there's no other name given under heaven Whereby we must be saved I'd rather have Jesus He's the only one that can save you I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
