[Verse 1] 
Why do you worry? Why do you fear? Have you forgotten That your Father is here Do you forget what He has brought you through? From back then and now your here


[Verse 2] 
Why do you have the slightest doubt? Don't you remember He's Alpha and Omega? Have you forgotten What He's done for you? If so, let me tell you


[Verse 3] 
That God is fighting for us That God is fighting for us So don't you worry So just relax and breathe easy Have you forgotten that He is strong and mighty And God is fighting and we say Thank You Lord


[Verse 4] 
Everyday and Every Night When you sleep And no ones watching He is there right by you To protect you and guide He never sleeps He never slumbers My plans for you are good and evil The Lion of the tribe of Judah Reigning King wants you to know that


[Verse 5] 
That God is fighting for us That God is fighting for us So don't you worry So just relax and breathe easy Have you forgotten that He is strong and mighty And God is fighting and we say Thank You Lord


[Verse 6] 
He will never leave you Never forsake you Though I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death He wants to know He wants to know that


[Verse 7] 
That God is fighting for us That God is fighting for us So don't you worry So just relax and breathe easy Have you forgotten that He is strong and mighty And God is fighting and we say Thank You Lord


[Verse 8] 
God is fighting for us God is fighting for us God is fighting for us
