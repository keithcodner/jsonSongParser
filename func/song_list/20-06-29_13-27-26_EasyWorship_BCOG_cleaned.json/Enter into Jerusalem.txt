[Verse 1] 
Enter into Jerusalem Let us go to God's house With the healthy and the sick With the worker and the weak Let us go to God's house


[Verse 2] 
Enter into Jerusalem Let us go to God's house Come and run with the wind And the God who reigns in peace Let us go to God's house


[Verse 3] 
We go celebrate, we go celebrate We go celebrate, oh Israel!!


[Verse 4] 
Praise the name of the Lord on high Praise his name in song Praise the Lord with a heavenly song With a heavenly song, with a heavenly song Praise the Lord


[Verse 5] 
Enter into Jerusalem Mek we walk-a-down there With the young and the old With the little and the large Mek we walk-a-down there


[Verse 6] 
Enter into Jerusalem Mek we walk-a-down there Swaying to the breeze With the God who reigns in peace Mek we walk-a-down there
