[Verse 1] 
Our Father We love to call you By your grace you have adopted Now we're your children You now receive us Joint heirs with Jesus Our Father, our Father


[Verse 2] 
Your awesome love You've shown us Goes beyond our wildest dreams You saturate our lives with grace & mercy


[Verse 3] 
And because you love, you chasten us If we should go astray Like a father, our Father


[Verse 4] 
Our Father, our Father Our Father, our father
