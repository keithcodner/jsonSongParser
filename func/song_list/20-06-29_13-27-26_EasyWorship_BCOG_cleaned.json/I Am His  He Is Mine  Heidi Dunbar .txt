[Verse 1] 
(Verse) They call me a screw up, they call me worthless But in His eyes, I'm worth more than silver They call me useless, they call me a burden But to Him, I'm more precious than gold


[Verse 2] 
I'm the apple of His eye, the desire of His heart With His love, I will survive There's no way I'm gonna die Jesus Christ, the son of man, Lord of my life I will Trust in You


[Verse 3] 
(Chorus) So I surrender my life onto you Lord And I vow to love You with all my heart When I feel like the weight of the world is resting on my shoulders I know He"ll never leave me, nor forsake me Cause He claimed me as his own I am His, and He is mine He is mine


[Verse 4] 
(Verse) They call me different, they call me unusual But they don't understand my destiny They call me crazy, they call me a dreamer But they don't understand who I am to Him


[Verse 5] 
(Bridge) And with faith, I'll believe that you will see me through I'll hold my head up to the sky as I wait for my breakthrough And when I feel all alone, I know You'll be right there To stay with me and guide me through every problem I'll face


[Verse 6] 
(Ending) He is mine x5
