[Verse 1] 
There are some things I may not know There are some places I can't go But I am sure of this one thing


[Verse 2] 
My God is real Real in my soul My God is real for He has washed and made me whole His Love for me is like pure gold My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul


[Verse 3] 
Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn Well they can all go on just leave me alone But as for me I'll take God's part


[Verse 4] 
I cannot tell just how It felt When Jesus washed my sins away But since that day yes since that hour God has been real for I can feel His mighty power
