[Verse 1] 
We want to see Jesus lifted high A banner that flies across this land That all men may see the truth and know He is the way to heaven


[Verse 2] 
We want to see We want to see We want to see Jesus lifted high


[Verse 3] 
Step by step We're moving forward Little by little We're taking ground Every prayer's a powerful weapon Strongholds come Tumbling down and down and down and down and down
