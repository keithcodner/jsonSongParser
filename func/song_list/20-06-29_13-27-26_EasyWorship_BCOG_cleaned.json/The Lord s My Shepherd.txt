[Verse 1] 
The Lord's my Shepherd I'll not want, He makes me down to lie in pastures green; He leadeth me the quiet waters by.


[Verse 2] 
My soul He doth restore again, And me to walk doth make; Within the paths of righteousness, E'en for His own name's sake.


[Verse 3] 
Yea, tho' I walk in death's dark vale, Yet will I fear no ill for Thou art with me And Thy rod and staff me comfort still.


[Verse 4] 
My table Thou hast furnished In presence of my foes; My head Thou dost with oil anoint, And my cup overflows.


[Verse 5] 
Goodness and mercy all my life Shall surely follow me, And in God's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be. Amen.
