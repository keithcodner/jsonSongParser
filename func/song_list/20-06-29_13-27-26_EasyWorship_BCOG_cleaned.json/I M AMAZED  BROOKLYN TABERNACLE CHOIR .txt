[Verse 1] 
No one knew how alone I was feeling, And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide Though I laughed and said my life was fine without You.


[Verse 2] 
I was covering up the secret tears I cried. Then one day someone told me your mercies, And the love You showed on a Hill called Calvary. There You died and purchased my redemption, When You broke sin's power and set my spirit free


[Verse 3] 
I'm amazed that You love me I'm amazed how You care Through Your precious blood, I found pardon And my sins are washed, they're all washed away All my sins are washed away


[Verse 4] 
Yes its true there've been days when I've failed You. Lord you know the many times I've gone astray. But I've learned Your love is stronger than my weakness, And Your ear is open everytime I pray.


[Verse 5] 
No one else have ever cared for me like You Lord. Other friends could never be as close to me. I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. Knowing You are everything I'll ever need.


[Verse 6] 
I'm amazed that You love me I'm amazed how You care Through Your precious blood, I found pardon And my sins are washed, they're all washed away All my sins are washed away
