[Verse 1] 
How wide is Your love That You would stretch Your arms And go around the world And why for me Would a Savior's cry be heard I don't know Why You went where I was meant to go I don't know why You love me so


[Verse 2] 
Those were my nails, that was my crown That pierced Your hands and Your brow Those were my thorns, those were my scorns Those were my tears that fell down And just as You said it would be You did it all for me And after You counted the cost You took my shame, my blame on my cross


[Verse 3] 
How deep is Your grace That You could see my need And choose to take my place And then for me These words I'd hear You say Father no Forgive them for they know not what they do I will go because I love them so
