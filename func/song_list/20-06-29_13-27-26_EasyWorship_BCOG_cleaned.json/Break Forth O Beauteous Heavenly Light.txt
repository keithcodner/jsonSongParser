[Verse 1] 
Break forth O beauteous heavenly light And usher in the morning; O shepherds, shudder not with fright, But hear the angel's warning. This Child, now weak in infancy, Our confidence and joy shall be, The power of Satan breaking; Our peace eternal making.


[Verse 2] 
He comes a Child, from realms on high, He comes the heav'ns adoring; He comes to earth to live and die, A broken race restoring. Although the King of kings is He, He comes in deep humility; His people to deliver, And reign in us forever.
