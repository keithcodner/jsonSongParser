[Verse 1] 
Holy holy are You Lord The whole earth is filled with Your glory Let the nations rise to give Honour and praise to Your name


[Verse 2] 
Let Your face shine on us And the world will know You live


[Verse 3] 
All the heavens shout Your praise Beautiful is our God The universe will sing Hallelujah to You our King


[Verse 4] 
End Hallelujah to You our King
