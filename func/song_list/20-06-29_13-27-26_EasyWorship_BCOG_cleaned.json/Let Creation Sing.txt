[Verse 1] 
The whole earth overflowing with your power and your glory There is no one like you God There is no one like you God


[Verse 2] 
Mountains bow nations tremble At your feet we cry Holy There is no one like you God There is no one like you God


[Verse 3] 
Let creation sing of the risen king Let the universe resound With a shout of love We will give to you All the highest praise


[Verse 4] 
Let your light shine upon us Let your light shine upon us For the glory of your name Will be over all the earth


[Verse 5] 
Forever, forever I'll sing Forever, forever I'll sing
