[Verse 1] 
But God hath promised strength for the day, Rest for the labor, light for the way, Grace for the trials, help from above, Unfailing sympathy, undying love.


[Verse 2] 
God hath not promised skies always blue, Flower strewn pathways all our lives through. God hath not promised sun without rain, Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.


[Verse 3] 
God hath not promised we shall not know Toil and temptation, trouble and woe. He hath not told us we shall not bear Many a burden many a care.


[Verse 4] 
God hath not promised smooth roads and wide, Swift, easy, travel needing no guide, Never a mountain, rocky and steep, Never a river, turbid and deep.
