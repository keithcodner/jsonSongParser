[Verse 1] 
You deserve the glory And the honour Lord we lift our hands In worship As we lift Your Holy Name


[Verse 2] 
For You are great You do miracles so great There is no one else like You There is no one else like You


[Verse 3] 
There is no one else There is no one else There is no one else There is no one else like You
