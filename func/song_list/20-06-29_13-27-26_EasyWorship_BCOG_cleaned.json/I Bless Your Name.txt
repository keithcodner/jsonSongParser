[Verse 1] 
I want to stay here in this place Resting in your everlasting arms There’s nothing as great as praising your name Lifting up the name of Jesus Christ As I behold your wondrous love


[Verse 2] 
I will forever glorify the King of Heaven It’s my joy, my life to praise your name Nothing could ever separate me from the love I’ve found in You I bless your name
