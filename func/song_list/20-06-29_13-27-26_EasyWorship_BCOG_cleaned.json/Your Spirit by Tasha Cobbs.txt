[Verse 1] 
Not By might Not by power By your spirit God Send your spirit God


[Verse 2] 
You are the fire We are the temple Your are the voice We are your song You are our God We are your people You are the light we stand in awe


[Verse 3] 
we stand in awe of you We stand in awe of you


[Verse 4] 
You called us out Out of the darkness Into your love Into your light Grace upon grace Beauty for ashes You come to us We come alive


[Verse 5] 
We stand in awe of you We stand in awe of you


[Verse 6] 
Breathe Come andf breathe on us Spirit Breathe Spirirt breathe on us
