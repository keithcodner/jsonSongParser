[Verse 1] 
Hosanna, loud hosanna, The little children sang; Through pillared court and temple, The lovely anthem rang. To Jesus, who had blessed them, Close folded to His breast; The children sang their praises, The simplest and the best.


[Verse 2] 
From Olivet they followed, 'Mid an exultant crowd; The victory palm branch waving, And chanting clear and loud. The Lord of men and angels, Rode on in lowly state; Nor scorned the little children, Should on His bidding wait.


[Verse 3] 
"Hosanna in the highest!" That ancient song we sing; For Christ is our Redeemer, The Lord of heaven, our King. O may we ever praise Him With heart and life and voice; And in His holy presence Eternally rejoice!
