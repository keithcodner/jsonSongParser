[Verse 1] 
My hope is You Show me Your ways Guide me in truth In all my days My hope is You


[Verse 2] 
To You oh Lord I lift my soul In You oh God I place my trust And do not let me be put to shame Don't let my enemies Triumph over me


[Verse 3] 
Christ alone; cornerstone Weak made strong in the Savior's love Through the storm, He is Lord Lord of all


[Verse 4] 
I am oh Lord filled with Your love You are oh God my salvation Well guard my life and rescue me My broken spirit shouts My mended heart cries out
