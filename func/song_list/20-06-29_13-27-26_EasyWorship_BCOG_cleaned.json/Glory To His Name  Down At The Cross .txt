[Verse 1] 
Down at the cross where my Saviour died Down where for cleasning from sin I cried There to my heart was the blood applied Glory to His name


[Verse 2] 
Glory to His name Glory to His name There to my heart was the blood applied Glory to His name


[Verse 3] 
I am so wondrously saved from sin Jesus so sweetly abides within There at the cross where He took me in Glory to His name


[Verse 4] 
O precious fountain that saves from sin I am so glad I have entered in There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean Glory to His name


[Verse 5] 
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet Cast thy poor soul at the Saviours feet Plunge in today and be made complete Glory to His name
