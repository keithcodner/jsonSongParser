[Verse 1] 
I am covered over by the robe of righteousness my Father gave to me I am covered over they the precious blood of Jesus and He live in me


[Verse 2] 
What a joy it is to know my Heavenly Father love me so and give to me Jesus When he looks at me he sees not what I used to be but he sees Jesus in me
