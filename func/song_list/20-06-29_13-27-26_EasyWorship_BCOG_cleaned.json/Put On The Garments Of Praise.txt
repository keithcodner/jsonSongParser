[Verse 1] 
I'm gonna put o the beautiful garments of praise And dance before my King I'm gonna tell of the world that I love Him so And the joy His praises bring


[Verse 2] 
I'm gonna lift up my hands Kick up my feet and let the hallelujah ring I'm gonna put on the beautiful garments of praise and dance before my King
