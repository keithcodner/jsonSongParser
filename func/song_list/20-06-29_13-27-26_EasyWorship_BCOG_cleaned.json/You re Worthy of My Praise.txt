I will worship, with all of my heart I will praise you, with all of my strength I will seek you, all of my days I will follow, all of your ways


[Verse 2] 
I will give, you all my worship I will give, you all my praise You alone, I long to worship You alone, are worthy of my praise

You are worthy, You are worthy You are worthy of my praise
