[Verse 1] 
Who is He, who answers when I call? Who is there in time of need? And when I get weak, who gives me His strength? Who else but God, who else but God!


[Verse 2] 
Who has the power beyond what eyes can see? Who orders the wind blow and rivers flow? So great and mighty, yet still cared for me. Who else but God, who else but God.
