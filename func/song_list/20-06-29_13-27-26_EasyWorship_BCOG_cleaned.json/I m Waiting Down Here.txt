[Verse 1] 
I'm waiting down here by the river where You come Lord Jesus Satan don't want me to cross Satan don't want me to cross


[Verse 2] 
I'm waiting down here by the river where You come Lord Jesus If You don't come to my rescue If You don't come to my rescue If You don't come to my rescue I'll be lost


[Verse 3] 
I'm waiting down here by the river where You come Lord Jesus


[Verse 4] 
If You don't come to my rescue I'll be lost


[Verse 5] 
I'm gonna wait Until my change comes


[Verse 6] 
He may not come when you want Him But He's always on time
