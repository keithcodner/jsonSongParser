[Verse 1] 
O for a heart to praise my God, A heart from sin set free, A heart that always feels thy blood So freely shed for me.


[Verse 2] 
A heart resigned, submissive, meek, My great Redeemer's throne, Where only Christ is heard to speak, Where Jesus reigns alone.


[Verse 3] 
A humble, lowly, contrite heart, Believing, true, and clean, Which neither life nor death can part From Christ who dwells within.


[Verse 4] 
A heart in every thought renewed And full of love divine, Perfect and right and pure and good, A copy, Lord, of thine.


[Verse 5] 
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart; Come quickly from above; Write thy new name upon my heart, Thy new, best name of Love.
