[Verse 1] 
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house They are ever praising You Blessed are those whose strength is in You Whose hearts are set on our God


[Verse 2] 
We will go from strength to strength Till we see You face to face


[Verse 3] 
Hear our prayer Oh Lord God Almighty Come bless our land As we seek You Worship You


[Verse 4] 
For You are holy For You are holy For You are holy Lord


[Verse 5] 
End As we seek You Worship You
