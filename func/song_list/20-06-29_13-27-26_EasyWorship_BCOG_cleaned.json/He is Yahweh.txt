[Verse 1] 
Who's moving on the waters? Who's holding up the moon? Who's pealing back the darkness? With the burning light of noon


[Verse 2] 
Who's standing on the mountain? Who's on the Earth below? Who's bigger than the Heavens? And he's the lover of my soul


[Verse 3] 
Creator, God He is Yahweh The great I am He is Yahweh The Lord of all He is Yahweh


[Verse 4] 
Rose of Sharon He is Yahweh The righteous son He is Yahweh The three in one He is Yahweh


[Verse 5] 
Who's he that makes me happy? Who's he that brings me peace? Who's he that brings me comfort And turns my bitter into sweet?


[Verse 6] 
Who's stiring up my passion? Who is rising up in me? Who is filling up my hunger? Oh with everything I need?


[Verse 7] 
Creator, God He is Yahweh The great I am He is Yahweh The Lord of all He is Yahweh


[Verse 8] 
Rose of Sharon He is Yahweh The righteous son He is Yahweh The three in one He is Yahweh


[Verse 9] 
You are holy and eternal And forever you will reign Every knee will bow down before you Every tongue will confess your name


[Verse 10] 
All the angels give you glory As they stand before your throne And here on Earth we gather To declare your name alone


[Verse 11] 
Yahweh
