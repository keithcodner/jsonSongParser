[Verse 1] 
Thou my everlasting portion, More than friend or life to me; All along my pilgrim journey, Savior, let me walk with Thee. Close to Thee, close to Thee, Close to Thee, close to Thee; All along my pilgrim journey, Savior, let me walk with Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Not for ease or worldly pleasure, Nor for fame my prayer shall be, Gladly will I toil and suffer, Only let me walk with Thee. Close to Thee, close to Thee, Close to Thee, close to Thee; Gladly will I toil and suffer, Only let me walk with Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Lead me through the vale of shadows, Bear me over life's fitful sea; Then the gate of life eternal May I enter Lord with Thee. Close to Thee, close to Thee, Close to Thee, close to Thee; Then the gate of life eternal May I enter Lord with Thee.
