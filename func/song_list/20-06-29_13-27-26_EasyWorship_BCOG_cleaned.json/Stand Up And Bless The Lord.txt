[Verse 1] 
Stand up and bless the Lord your God Ye people of God's choice; Stand up and bless the Lord your God With heart and soul and voice.


[Verse 2] 
Though high above all praise, Above all blessing high, Who would not fear His holy name, And laud and magnify?


[Verse 3] 
O for the living flame From God's own altar brought, To touch our lips, our minds inspire, And wing to heaven our thought!


[Verse 4] 
God is our strength and song, Now is salvation ours; Then be God's love in Christ proclaimed With all our ransomed powers.


[Verse 5] 
Stand up and bless the Lord; The Lord your God adore; Stand up and bless God's glorious name, Henceforth forevermore.
