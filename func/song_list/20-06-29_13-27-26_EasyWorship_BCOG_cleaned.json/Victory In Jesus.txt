[Verse 1] 
I heard an old old story How a Savoiur came from glory How He gave His life on Calvary To save a wretch like me


[Verse 2] 
I heard about His groaning Of His precious blood's atoning Then I repeating of my sins And won the victory


[Verse 3] 
Victory in Jesus My Saviour forever He sought me and He bought me With His redeeming blood


[Verse 4] 
He loved me and I knew Him And all my love is due Him He plunged me to victory Beneath the cleansing flood


[Verse 5] 
I heard about His healing Of His cleansing power revealing How He made the lame to walk again And cause the blind to see


[Verse 6] 
And then I cried "Dear Jesus Come and heal my broken spirit" And somehow Jesus came brought To me the victory


[Verse 7] 
I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory And I heard about the streets of gold Beyond the crystal sea


[Verse 8] 
About the angels singing And the old redemption story And some sweet day I'll sing up there The song of victory
