[Verse 1] 
When I think of You, I see You dancing, You're dancing When I think of You, I hear You singing to me When I think of You, I see You praying, You're praying When I think of You, I hear You calling for me


[Verse 2] 
Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord Yahweh, Hallelujah we sing Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord Yahweh, Your banner for me Your banner for me is love


[Verse 3] 
There is no one like You There is no one like You My Yahweh My Yahweh
