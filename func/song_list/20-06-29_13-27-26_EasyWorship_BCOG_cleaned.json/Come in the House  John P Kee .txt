[Verse 1] 
Let Your glory fill this house Let Your glory fill this house Let the fragrance of a sweet smelling savor Fill the temple Remove all the fear and doubt So Your glory can fill this house


[Verse 2] 
Let your presence fill this house Let your presence fill this house Let the essence of a sweet smelling savor Fill the temple Remove all guilt and doubt So your presence can fill this house


[Verse 3] 
Let your love fill the house Love fill the house Jesus you are welcome Let your love fill this house


[Verse 4] 
Come in the house Come in the house Jesus you are welcome Come in the house


[Verse 5] 
Jesus you are welcome Jesus you are welcome Jesus you are welcome Come in the house
