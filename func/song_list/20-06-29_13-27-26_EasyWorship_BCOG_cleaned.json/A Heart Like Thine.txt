[Verse 1] 
Come to my soul, blessed Jesus. Hear me, O Savior divine. Open the fountain and cleanse me. Give me a heart a heart like Thine.


[Verse 2] 
Give me a love that knows no ill. Give me the grace to do Thy will. Pardon and cleanse this soul of mine. Give me a heart like Thine.


[Verse 3] 
Only a joy, a few brief years, Only a dream, a vale of tears; Vain is this world, I now resign. Give me a heart like Thine.


[Verse 4] 
Open mine eyes that I may see. Show me the cross of Calvary. There may I go and not repine. Give me a heart like Thine.


[Verse 5] 
Pillow my head upon Thy breast. Shelter my soul and give me rest. Fill me with love as I recline. Give me a heart like Thine.
