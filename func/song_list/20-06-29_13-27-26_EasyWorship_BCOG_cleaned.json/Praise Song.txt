[Verse 1] 
And we know that You are our Savior And we know that You are the Son And we know that You are the Savior Of everyone


[Verse 2] 
We praise You O Lord For the love that You give And the time that You spent On this world for our sins We lift up Your name In honor and praise In Jesus we place All our love and our faith


[Verse 3] 
The time is now near When You will appear When we see Your face And Your voice will appear And then we will sing To Jesus the King The Maker Creator of everything
