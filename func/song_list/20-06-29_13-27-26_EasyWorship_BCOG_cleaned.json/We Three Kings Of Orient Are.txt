[Verse 1] 
O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright; Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light.


[Verse 2] 
We three kings of Orient are, Bearing gifts we traverse afar; Field and fountain moor and mountain, Following yonder star.


[Verse 3] 
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain, Gold I bring to crown Him again; King forever, ceasing never, Over us all to reign.


[Verse 4] 
Frankincense to offer have I, Incense owns a Deity nigh; Prayer and praising, all men raising, Worship Him, God on high.


[Verse 5] 
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume, Breathes a life of gathering gloom; Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, Sealed in the stone cold tomb.


[Verse 6] 
Glorious now behold Him arise, King and God and sacrifice; Alleluia, alleluia! Earth to heav'n replies.
