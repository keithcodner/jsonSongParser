[Verse 1] 
One star burns in the darkness Shines with the promise Emmanuel One child born in the stillness Living within us Emmanuel


[Verse 2] 
We're singing glory, glory Let there be peace, let there be peace Singing glory, glory Let there be peace, let it start in me


[Verse 3] 
One voice speak for the voiceless Hope for the hopeless Emmanuel One love brings us together Now and forever Emmanuel


[Verse 4] 
We're singing glory, glory Let there be peace, let there be peace Singing glory, glory Let there be peace, let it start in me


[Verse 5] 
Do not be afraid, his love is strong enough to save us Nothing stands in the way, his love is strong enough to lead us


[Verse 6] 
Do not be afraid, his love is strong enough to save us Nothing stands in the way, his love is strong enough to lead us


[Verse 7] 
We're singing glory, glory Let there be peace, let there be peace Singing glory, glory Let there be peace, let it start in me
