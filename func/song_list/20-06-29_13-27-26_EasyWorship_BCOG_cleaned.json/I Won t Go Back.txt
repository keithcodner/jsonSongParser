[Verse 1] 
I've been changed Healed Freed Delivered


[Verse 2] 
I've found joy Peace Grace And Favor


[Verse 3] 
Right now is the moment Today is the day I've been changed I've been changed I have waited for this moment to come And I won't let it pass me by


[Verse 4] 
I won't go back I can't go back To the way it used to be Before Your presence came and changed me


[Verse 5] 
All my shame, guilt and sins Forgiven No more chains and fear My past is over


[Verse 6] 
Say right now is the moment Today, Today is the day I've been changed I've been changed And I have waited I have waited for this moment to come And I won't let it pass me by


[Verse 7] 
I'm never going back I'm never going back Never going back To the way it was
