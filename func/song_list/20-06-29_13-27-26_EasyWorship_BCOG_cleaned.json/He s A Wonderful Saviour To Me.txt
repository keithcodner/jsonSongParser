[Verse 1] 
For He's a wonderful Savior to me, He's a wonderful Savior to me. I was lost in sin, But Jesus took me in. He's a wonderful Savior to me.


[Verse 2] 
I was lost in sin, But Jesus rescued me. He's a wonderful Savior to me. I was bound by fear, But Jesus set me free. He's a wonderful Savior to me.


[Verse 3] 
He's a friend so true, So patient and so kind. He's wonderful Savior to me, Ev'rything I need in Him I always find. He's a wonderful Savior to me.


[Verse 4] 
He is always near, To comfort and to cheer. He's a wonderful Savior to me, He forgives my sin, He dries my ev'ry tear, He's a wonderful Savior to me.


[Verse 5] 
Dearer grows the love Of Jesus day by day, He's a wonderful Savior to me, Sweeter is His grace, While pressing on my way. He's a wonderful Savior to me.
