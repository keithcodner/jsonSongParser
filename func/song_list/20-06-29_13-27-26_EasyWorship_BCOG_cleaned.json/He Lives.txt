[Verse 1] 
I've got something to sing about I've got something to shout about I've got something to tell the world about I've got something to live for I've got something worth dying for I've got something to tell the world about


[Verse 2] 
He lives He lives I know my Savior lives He lives He lives His life has set me free I've got something to sing about I've got something to shout about I've got something to tell the world about I stand here forgiven Abundant life I'm liven' Because He lives all these things I've found


[Verse 3] 
There have been many who claimed That they were God but in those graves Their bones remain but in the tomb Where my Jesus once was laid There's nothing there that's why I have to say
