[Verse 1] 
We lift our hands in the sanctuary We lift our hands to give You the glory We lift our hands to give You the praise And we will praise You for the rest of our days Yes we will praise You for the rest of our days


[Verse 2] 
We clap our hands in the sanctuary We clap our hands to give you the glory We clap our hands to give you the praise And we will praise you for the rest of our days Yes we will praise you for the rest of our days


[Verse 3] 
We sing our song in the sanctuary We sing our song to give you the glory We sing our song to give you the praise And we will praise you for the rest of our days Yes we will praise you for the rest of our days


[Verse 4] 
Jesus we give You the praise Emmanuel we lift up Your name Heavenly Father, coming Messiah And we will praise You for the rest of our days Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days
