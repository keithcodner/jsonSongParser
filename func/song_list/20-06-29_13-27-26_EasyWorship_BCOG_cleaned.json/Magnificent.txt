[Verse 1] 
Who compares to you Who set the stars in their place You who calmed the raging seas That came crashing over me


[Verse 2] 
Who compares to you You who bring the morning light The hope of all the earth Is rest assured in your great love


[Verse 3] 
You are magnificent, eternally Wonderful, glorious Jesus No one ever will compare To you Jesus


[Verse 4] 
When the evening fades You call forth songs of joy As the morning wakes We your children give you praise


[Verse 5] 
When the evening fades You call forth songs of joy The God of all the earth We your children give you praise
