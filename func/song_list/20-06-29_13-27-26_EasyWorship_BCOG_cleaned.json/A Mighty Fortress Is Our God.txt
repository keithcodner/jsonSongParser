[Verse 1] 
A mighty fortress is our God, A bulwark never failing, A bulwark never failing, Bulwark never failing, A bulwark never failing, A bulwark never failing, A bulwark never failing.


[Verse 2] 
Our helper He amid the, Flood our helper He, Our helper amid the flood, Of mortal ills prevailing, Mid mortal ills prevailing,


[Verse 3] 
For still our ancient foe, For still our ancient foe, Doth seek for us woe, Doth seek for us woe, With craft and great might, With craft and great might,


[Verse 4] 
Armed with cruel hate, And armed with cruel hate, And armed with cruel hate, On earth is none His equal, On earth is none equal.
