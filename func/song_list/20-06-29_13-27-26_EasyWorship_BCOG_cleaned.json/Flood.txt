[Verse 1] 
But if I can't swim After forty days And my mind is crushed By the crashing waves Lift me up so high That I cannot fall Lift me oh woh


[Verse 2] 
Rain rain on my face Hasn't stopped raining for days My world is a flood Slowly I've become one with the mud


[Verse 3] 
Downpour on my soul Splashing in the ocean I'm losing control Dark sky all around Can't feel my feet Touching the ground


[Verse 4] 
Lift me up When I'm falling Lift me up When I'm weak and I'm dying Lift me up I need You to hold me Lift me up And keep me from drowning again
