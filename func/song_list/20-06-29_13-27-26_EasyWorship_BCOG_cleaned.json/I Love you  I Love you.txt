Lovely are Your dwelling places Thirsting I go after You Jesus, my source, my reward Your love restoring my soul


[Verse 2] 
Now I'm Yours and You are mine And from my heart a song arise


[Verse 3] 
I Love You I Love You I Love You And my heart will follow Solely after You


[Verse 4] 
Jesus there is none besides you Righteous, ruler of the earth Nations will come and bow down Name over all names I sing You praises And all that I can say to You is
