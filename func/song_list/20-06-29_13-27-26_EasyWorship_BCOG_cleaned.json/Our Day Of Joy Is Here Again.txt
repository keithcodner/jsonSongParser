[Verse 1] 
Glory to our God, we sing, Glory to our Lord and King; Peace, goodwill with all abide, This holy Christmas tide.


[Verse 2] 
Our day of joy is here again, With love and peace and song; Come, let us join the angelic strain With voices clear and strong.


[Verse 3] 
When darkness lay upon the earth, A glorious light did shine; God sent a Gift of priceless worth And showed His love divine.


[Verse 4] 
Now to the manger let us go To worship and adore; The tender Babe upon the straw, Our Savior evermore.


[Verse 5] 
How wonderful that God's own Son Should so Himself abase! He thrust the mighty from their throne, And gave the lowly grace.
