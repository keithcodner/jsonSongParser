[Verse 1] 
The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want In green pastures He makes me lie down He restores my soul and leads me on for His name For His great name


[Verse 2] 
Surely goodness, surely mercy Right beside me all my days And I will dwell in Your house forever And bless Your holy name


[Verse 3] 
You prepare a table right before me In the presence of my enemies Though the arrow flies and the terror of night Is at my door, I'll trust you Lord


[Verse 4] 
Surely goodness, surely mercy Right beside me all my days And I will dwell in Your house forever And bless Your holy name


[Verse 5] 
Even though I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death I will fear no evil Even though I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death You are on my side Even though I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death I will fear no evil Even though I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death You are on my side


[Verse 6] 
Surely goodness, surely mercy Right beside me all my days And I will dwell in Your house forever And bless Your holy name
