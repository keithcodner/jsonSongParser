[Verse 1] 
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea Creation revealing Your majesty From the colours of Fall To the fragrance of Spring Every creature unique in the song that it sings All exclaiming


[Verse 2] 
Indescribable, Uncontainable You placed the stars in the sky and you know them by name You are amazing God


[Verse 3] 
All powerful, Untamable Awe struck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim You are amazing God


[Verse 4] 
Who see's lightning bolts and tells them where they should go or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow Who imagined the Sun and gives source to its light Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night none can fathom


[Verse 5] 
Indescribable, Uncontainable You placed the stars in the sky and you know them by name You are amazing God


[Verse 6] 
Incomprable, unchangeable, You've seen the depths of my heart And you love me the same You are an amazing God You are an amazing God
