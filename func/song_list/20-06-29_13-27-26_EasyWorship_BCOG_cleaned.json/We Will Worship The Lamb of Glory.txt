[Verse 1] 
We will worship the Lamb of Glory We will worship the King of kings We will worship the Lamb of Glory We will worship the King


[Verse 2] 
And with our hands lifted high We will worship and sing And with our hands lifted high We come before You rejoicing With our hands lifted high to the sky When the world wonders why


[Verse 3] 
We'll just tell them we're loving our King oh oh oh We'll just tell them we're loving our King


[Verse 4] 
We'll just tell them we're loving our King oh oh oh We'll just tell them we're loving our King Eh Eh Eh
