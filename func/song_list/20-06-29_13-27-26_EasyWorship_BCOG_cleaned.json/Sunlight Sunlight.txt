[Verse 1] 
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today! Sunlight, sunlight all along the way! Since the Savior found me, Took away my sin, I have had the sunlight of His love within.


[Verse 2] 
I wandered in the shades of night Till Jesus came to me, And with the sunlight of His love Bid all my darkness flee.


[Verse 3] 
Tho clouds may gather in the sky, And billows round me roll, However dark the world may be, I've sunlight in my soul,


[Verse 4] 
While walking in the light of God, I sweet communion find; I press with holy vigor on, And leave the world behind.


[Verse 5] 
I cross the wide extended fields, I journey o'er the plain, And in the sunlight of His love I reap the golden grain.


[Verse 6] 
Soon I shall see Him as He is, The light that came to me; Behold the brightness of His face Thro'out eternity.
