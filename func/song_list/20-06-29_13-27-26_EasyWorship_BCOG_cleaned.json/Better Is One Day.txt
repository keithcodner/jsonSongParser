[Verse 1] 
How lovely is Your dwelling place O Lord Almighty For my soul longs and even faints for You


[Verse 2] 
For here my heart is satisfied Within Your presence I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings


[Verse 3] 
Better is one day in Your courts Better is one day in Your house Better is one day in Your courts Than a thousand elsewhere


[Verse 4] 
One thing I ask and I would seek To see Your beauty To find You in the place Your glory dwells


[Verse 5] 
My heart and flesh cry out For You the Living God Your Spirit's water to my soul


[Verse 6] 
I've tasted and I've seen Come once again to me I will draw near to You I will draw near to You
