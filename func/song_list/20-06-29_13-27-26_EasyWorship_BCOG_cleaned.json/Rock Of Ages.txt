[Verse 1] 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee. Let the water and the blood, From Thy wounded side which flowed, Be of sin the double cure, Save from wrath and make me pure.


[Verse 2] 
Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling; Naked come to Thee for dress, Helpless look to Thee for grace; Foul I to the fountain fly, Wash me Savior or I die.


[Verse 3] 
Not the labor of my hands, Can fulfill Thy law's demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, All for sin could not atone; Thou must save and Thou alone.


[Verse 4] 
While I draw this fleeting breath, When my eyes shall close in death, When I rise to worlds unknown, And behold Thee on Thy throne, Rock of Ages cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Could my tears forever flow? Could my zeal no languor know? These for sin could not atone; Thou must save, and Thou alone. In my hand no price I bring; Simply to thy cross I cling.
