[Verse 1] 
There must be more than this, O breath of God come breathe within, There must be more than this, Spirit of God we wait for You.


[Verse 2] 
Fill us anew we pray, Fill us anew we pray.


[Verse 3] 
Consuming fire fan into flame, A passion for Your Name, Spirit of God fall in this place, Lord have Your way, Lord have Your way with us,


[Verse 4] 
Come like a rushing wind, Clothe us with power from on high, Now set the captives free, Leave us abandoned to Your praise.


[Verse 5] 
Lord let Your glory fall, Lord let Your glory fall.


[Verse 6] 
Stir it up in our hearts Lord, Stir it up in our hearts Lord, Stir it up in our hearts Lord, A passion for Your Name.
