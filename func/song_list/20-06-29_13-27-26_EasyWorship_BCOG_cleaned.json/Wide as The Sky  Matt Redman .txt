[Verse 1] 
Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky We lift You high, we lift You high Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry God, we lift Your name high Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky We lift You high, we lift You high Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry God, we lift Your name high


[Verse 2] 
Let all the other names fade away Let all the other names fade away Until there's only You Let all the other names fade away Jesus, take Your place Jesus, take Your place Let all the other names fade away Let all the other names fade away Until there's only You Let all the other names fade away Jesus, take Your place Jesus, take Your place


[Verse 3] 
Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky We lift You high, we lift You high Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry God, we lift Your name high Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky We lift You high, we lift You high Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry God, we lift Your name high
