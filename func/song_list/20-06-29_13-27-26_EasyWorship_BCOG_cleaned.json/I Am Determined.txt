[Verse 1] 
I am determined To hold out to the end Jesus is with me On Him I can depend


[Verse 2] 
For I know I have salvation I can feel it in my soul I am determined to hold out to the end


[Verse 3] 
Hold out, hold out, hold out, hold... Hold out, hold out, hold out, hold out I am determined to hold out to the end
