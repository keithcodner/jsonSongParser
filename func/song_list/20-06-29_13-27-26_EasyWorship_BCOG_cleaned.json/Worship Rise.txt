[Verse 1] 
From here to there Worship is filling the atmosphere Both now and then Songs of your love will never end


[Verse 2] 
All day and night As we bow down our praise will rise Inside and out All that I am will shout


[Verse 3] 
Let my worship rise Like a sweet perfume I'll pour my love, my love All over you


[Verse 4] 
Let my worship rise Like a sweet perfume I'll pour my love, my love All over your Let my worship rise Like a sweet perfume I'll pour my love, my love


[Verse 5] 
All over you
