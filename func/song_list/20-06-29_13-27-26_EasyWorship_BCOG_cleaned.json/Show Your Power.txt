[Verse 1] 
He is the Lord, And He reigns on high He is the lord Spoke into the darkness, Created the light He is the Lord


[Verse 2] 
Who is like unto Him, Never ending in days He is the Lord And He comes in power, As we call on His name He is the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Show your power O Lord our God


[Verse 4] 
Your gospel oh Lord, Is the hope for our nation You are the Lord It's the power of God, For our salvation You are the Lord


[Verse 5] 
We ask not for riches, But look to the cross You are the Lord And for our inheritance, Give us the lost You are the Lord


[Verse 6] 
Send Your power O Lord, our God
