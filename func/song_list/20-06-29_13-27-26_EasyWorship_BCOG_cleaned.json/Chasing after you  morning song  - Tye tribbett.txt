[Verse 1] 
Each and everyday I will seek Your face. My soul is crying out, for more I want more of You. I won't be satisfied, nor content With where I am So I will apprehend, 'till I'm captured By what I'm after.


[Verse 2] 
And I will go from faith to faith From glory to glory


[Verse 3] 
I'll forever be chasing after You I'll be chasing after You
