[Verse 1] 
Children of the heavenly Father, Safely in His bosom gather; Nestling bird nor star in heaven Such a refuge e'er was given.


[Verse 2] 
God His own doth tend and nourish, In His holy courts they flourish; From all evil things He spares them, In His mighty arms He bears them.


[Verse 3] 
Neither life nor death shall ever, From the Lord His children sever; Unto them His grace He showeth, And their sorrows all He knoweth.


[Verse 4] 
Lo, their very hairs He numbers, And no daily care encumbers; Them that share His every blessing, And His help in woes distressing.


[Verse 5] 
Praise the Lord in joyful numbers, Your protector never slumbers; At the will of your defender, Every foe man must surrender.


[Verse 6] 
Though He giveth or He taketh, God His children ne'er forsaketh; His the loving purpose solely To preserve them pure and holy.
