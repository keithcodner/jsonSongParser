[Verse 1] 
In Your presence there is comfort In Your presence there is peace When we seek to know Your heart We will find such blessed assurance In Your holy presence Lord


[Verse 2] 
In the quiet of this hour As I kneel before You now I believe Your promise to be faithful I don't always understand What Your perfect will demands But I've learned to trust You more In Your presence Lord


[Verse 3] 
There can be such sweet reward When we wait upon the Lord As we take the time He gives His perfect wisdom To be found in Him alone All our deepest secrets known We're surrounded by His grace When we seek His face


[Verse 4] 
In Your presence there is comfort In Your presence there is peace When we seek the Father's heart We will find such blessed assurance An ever-open door To know our Savior more In the presence of our Lord
