[Verse 1] 
I'm chasing after You No matter what I have to do Cause I need You More and More


[Verse 2] 
More and More


[Verse 3] 
I'm chasing after You I'm praising my way through I am in need of You I'm chasing after You


[Verse 4] 
Lord, I search for You


[Verse 5] 
My heart cries out for You
