[Verse 1] 
Purify my heart Let it be as gold and precious silver Purify my heart let it be as gold, pure gold


[Verse 2] 
Refiner's fire My heart's one desire Is to be holy


[Verse 3] 
Set apart for You, Lord I choose to be holy Set apart for You, my Master Ready to do Your will


[Verse 4] 
Purify my heart Cleanse me from within And make me holy


[Verse 5] 
Purify my heart Cleanse me from my sin Deep within
