[Verse 1] 
Show me Your glory Send down Your presence I want to see Your face Show me Your glory Majesty shines about You I can't go on without You Lord


[Verse 2] 
I caught a glimpse of Your splendor In the corner of my eye The most beautiful thing I've ever seen And it was like a flash of lightning Reflected off the sky And I know I'll never be the same


[Verse 3] 
When I climb down the mountain And get back to my life I won't settle for ordinary things I'm gonna follow You forever For all of my days I won't rest 'til I see You again
