[Verse 1] 
There is a God who Loves me Who Wraps me in his Arms That is the place where I'm changed That's where I Belong


[Verse 2] 
Take me to That Place Lord To That Secret Place Where I can be With you and you Can Make me Like you


[Verse 3] 
Wrap me in your Arms Wrap me in your Arms Wrap me in your Arms
