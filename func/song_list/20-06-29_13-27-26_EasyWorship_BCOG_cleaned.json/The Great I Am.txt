[Verse 1] 
I wanna be close, close to your side So heaven is real, and death is a lie I wanna hear voices, of angels above Singing as one, singing


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah, Holy, Holy God almighty, great I Am Who is worthy None beside thee God Almighty Great I Am


[Verse 3] 
I wanna be near, near to your heart Loving the world, hating the dark I want to see dry bones living again Singing as one, singing


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah, Holy, Holy God almighty, great I Am Who is worthy None beside thee God Almighty Great I Am


[Verse 5] 
He's the great I Am, great I Am


[Verse 6] 
The mountains shake before Him! The demons run and flee At the mention of the name King of Majesty!


[Verse 7] 
There is no power in hell Or any who can stand Before the power and the presence of the great I Am! The great I Am, the great I Am! The great I Am, the great I Am, the great I Am!

The mountains shake before Him! The demons run and flee At the mention of the name King of Majesty!

There is no power in hell Or any who can stand Before the power and the presence of the great I Am! The great I Am, the great I Am! The great I Am, the great I Am, the great I Am!
