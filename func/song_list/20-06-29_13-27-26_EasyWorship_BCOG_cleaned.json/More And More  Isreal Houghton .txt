[Verse 1] 
All we want and all we need is found in Jesus All we ask is more of You


[Verse 2] 
For the Lord is good And His love endures Yes the Lord is good forever And I'll shout it out From the mountain tops Yes the Lord is good forever


[Verse 3] 
We want You more and more We want You more and more We want You more and more more and more
