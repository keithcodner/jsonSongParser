[Verse 1] 
It was on a Sunday Somebody touch me Somebody touch me Somebody touch me


[Verse 2] 
It was on a Sunday Somebody touch me


[Verse 3] 
It must have been the hands of the Lord


[Verse 4] 
It was on a Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday


[Verse 5] 
I don't know what day it was Somebody touch me


[Verse 6] 
Glory, glory, glory Somebody touch me
