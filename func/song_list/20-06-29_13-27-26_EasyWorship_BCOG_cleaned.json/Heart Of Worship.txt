[Verse 1] 
When the music fades and all is stripped away And I simply come Longing just to bring something that's of worth That will Bless Your heart


[Verse 2] 
I'll bring You more than a song for a song in itself Is not what You have required You search much deeper within through the way things appear You're looking into my heart


[Verse 3] 
I'm coming back to the heart of worship Where it's all about you It's all about You Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it It's all about You It's all about You Jesus


[Verse 4] 
King of endless worth No one could express How much you deserve Though I'm weak and poor All I have is yours Every single breath


[Verse 5] 
I'll bring you more than a song For a song in itself Is not what you have required You search much deeper within Through the way things appear You're looking into my heart


[Verse 6] 
I'm coming back to the heart of worship Where it's all about you It's all about You Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it It's all about You It's all about You Jesus


[Verse 7] 
End It's all about You It's all about You It's all about You Jesus
