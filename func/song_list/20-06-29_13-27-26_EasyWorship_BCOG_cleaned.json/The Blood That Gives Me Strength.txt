[Verse 1] 
The blood that Jesus shed for me Way back on Calvary The blood that gives me strength From day to day It will never lose it's power


[Verse 2] 
It reaches to the highest mountain And it flows to the lowest valley The blood that gives me strength From day to day It will never lose it's power


[Verse 3] 
It soothes my doubts And calms my fears And it dries all my tears The blood that gives me strength From day to day It will never lose it's power
