[Verse 1] 
More, more about Jesus; More, more about Jesus; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.


[Verse 2] 
More about Jesus would I know, More of His grace to others show; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.


[Verse 3] 
More about Jesus let me learn, More of His holy will discern; Spirit of God, my teacher be, Showing the things of Christ to me.


[Verse 4] 
More about Jesus in His word, Holding communion with my Lord, Hearing His voice in every line, Making each faithful saying mine.


[Verse 5] 
More about Jesus on His throne, Riches in glory all His own; More of His kingdom's sure increase; More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
