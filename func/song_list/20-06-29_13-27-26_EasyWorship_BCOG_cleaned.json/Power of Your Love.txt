[Verse 1] 
Lord I come to you Let my heart be changed, renewed Flowing from the grace that I found in you


[Verse 2] 
And Lord I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me will be stripped away By the power of your love


[Verse 3] 
Hold me close Let your love surround me Bring me near Draw me to your side


[Verse 4] 
And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle And I will soar with you Your Spirit leads me on


[Verse 5] 
By the power of your love


[Verse 6] 
Lord unveil my eyes Let me see you face to face The knowledge of your love As you live in me


[Verse 7] 
Lord renew my mind As your will unfolds in my life In living everyday, in the power of your love
