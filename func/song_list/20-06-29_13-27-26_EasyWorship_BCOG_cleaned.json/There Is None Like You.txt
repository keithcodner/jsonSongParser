[Verse 1] 
You're giver of salvation Ruler of the nations Father of creation I sing to You My refuge and my strength Purpose and my peace The reason I believe when I can't see Redeemer full of grace Author of my faith I sing


[Verse 2] 
There is none like You We love and we praise Amazing is Your grace There is none like You The only King of kings Lord of everything It's true There is none like You


[Verse 3] 
A few more pages turned Another lesson learned 'Cause You speak through Your word Right to my heart You hold the hands of time Yet You still hold mine And I cannot see why You love me like You do Creator of life My hope and my guide I sing


[Verse 4] 
Misc 1 BRIDGE You hold tomorrow Making all things new There is none like You
