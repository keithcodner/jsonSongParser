[Verse 1] 
We will have no other gods before You Nothing on earth will compete for Your throne You are sov'reign I Am And You reign in our hearts alone We will exalt You on high forever King of all kings And the Lord of all lords We will have no other gods before You


[Verse 2] 
The God of the heavens The Ancient of Days The God of our fathers And God of my praise The Alpha Omega Beginning and End Forever and ever Your kingdom will stand We come to bow before You now We come to lay our lives down


[Verse 3] 
Our Maker Creator Before time began Messiah and Savior Redeemer and Friend Our Rock of Salvation So faithful and true We give all the glory And honor to You For You alone are worthy Of our never-ending love
