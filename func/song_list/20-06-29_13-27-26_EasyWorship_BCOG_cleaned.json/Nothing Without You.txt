[Verse 1] 
Take these hands And lift them up For I have not the strength To praise You near enough See I have nothing I have nothing Without You


[Verse 2] 
And take my voice And pour it out Let it sing The songs of mercy I have found For I have nothing I have nothing Without You


[Verse 3] 
And all my soul needs Is all Your love to cover me So all the world will see That I have nothing without You


[Verse 4] 
Take my body And build it up May it be broken as An offering of love For I have nothing I have nothing Without You


[Verse 5] 
)But I love You yeah With all my heart With all my soul With all my mind And all the strength That I can find


[Verse 6] 
End Take my time here on this earth And let it glorify All that You are worth For I am nothing I am nothing Without You
