[Verse 1] 
(But) nothing compares To the greatness of knowing You Lord Oh no and nothing compares To the greatness of knowing You Lord Oh no


[Verse 2] 
Well I've heard all the stories And I've seen all the signs Witnessed all the glory And tasted all that's fine


[Verse 3] 
I see all the people Wasting all their time Building up their riches For a life that's fine


[Verse 4] 
And I find myself just living for today 'Cause I don't know what Tomorrow's gonna bring So no matter if I rise or fall I'll never be alone woah no Not alone
