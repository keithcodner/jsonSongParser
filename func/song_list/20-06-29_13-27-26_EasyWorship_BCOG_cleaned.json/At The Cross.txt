[Verse 1] 
Beautiful Savior All through the ages You’ve been a constant friend Your body was broken in order to save me Now I am born again


[Verse 2] 
Slide (Misc 1) I find strength in your love I find power in your blood I find comfort in the source of your arms


[Verse 3] 
At the cross I am changed And my life will never be the same You’ve become my rock and my peace A glorious song that’s risen in me Your love made a way and everything changed At the cross


[Verse 4] 
Glorious Savior Shining forever As sweet as the light I see So beautifully broken, reigning in power You’re the bread of life who lives to set me free
