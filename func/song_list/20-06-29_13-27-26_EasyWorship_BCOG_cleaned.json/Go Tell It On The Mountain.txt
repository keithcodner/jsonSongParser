[Verse 1] 
Go tell it on the mountain, Over the hills and everywhere; Go tell it on the mountain, That Jesus Christ is born.


[Verse 2] 
Down in a lowly manger, The humble Christ was born; And brought us God's salvation, That blessed Christmas morn.


[Verse 3] 
When I was a seeker, I sought both night and day; I asked the Lord to help me, And He showed me the way.


[Verse 4] 
He made me a watchman, Upon the city wall; And if I am a Christian, I am the least of all.


[Verse 5] 
While shepherds kept their watching, O'er silent flocks by night; Behold throughout the heavens, There shone a holy light.


[Verse 6] 
And lo, when they had seen it, They all bowed down and prayed; They traveled on together To where the Babe was laid.


[Verse 7] 
The shepherds feared and trembled, When lo above the earth; Rang out the angel chorus, That hailed our Savior's birth.


[Verse 8] 
When I was a sinner, I prayed both night and day; I asked the Lord to help me, And He showed me the way.
