[Verse 1] 
I trust in You, my faithful Lord; How perfect is Your love.


[Verse 2] 
You answer me, before I call; My hope, my strength, my song.


[Verse 3] 
And I shout for joy; I thank You, Lord. Your plan stands firm forever. And Your praise will be, contually pouring from my heart.


[Verse 4] 
I will bless You, Lord I will bless You, Lord How my soul cries out for my God I will bless You, Lord
