[Verse 1] 
I'm trading my sorrows I'm trading my shame I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord


[Verse 2] 
I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my pain I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Yes Lord Yes Lord Yes yes Lord Yes Lord Yes Lord Yes yes Lord Yes Lord Yes Lord Yes Yes Lord Amen.


[Verse 4] 
I'm pressed but not crushed Persecuted not abandon Struck down but not destroyed I am blessed beyond the curse For His promise will endure And His joy is gonna be my strength Though the sorrows will last for a night His joy comes with the morning
