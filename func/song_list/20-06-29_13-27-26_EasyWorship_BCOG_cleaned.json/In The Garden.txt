[Verse 1] 
And He walks with me, And He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.


[Verse 2] 
I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses; And the voice I hear, falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses.


[Verse 3] 
He speaks, and the sound of His voice is so sweet, The birds hush their singing, And the melody that He gave to me, Within my heart is ringing.


[Verse 4] 
I'd stay in the garden with Him, Though the night around me be falling, But He bids me go; Through the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.
