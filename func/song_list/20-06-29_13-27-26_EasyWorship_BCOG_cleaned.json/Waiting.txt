[Verse 1] 
Merciful One Prince of Peace Son of God revealed Accept our offering To You we yield


[Verse 2] 
Surrounding Your altar Our worship is laid Wanting more of You We stay


[Verse 3] 
We stay waiting We stay waiting We stay waiting Oh Lord, we wait for You


[Verse 4] 
We say come We say come We say come Oh Lord, we wait for You
