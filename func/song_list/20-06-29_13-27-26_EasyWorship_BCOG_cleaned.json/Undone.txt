[Verse 1] 
Here before Your throne of grace Resting here in Your embrace My Savior God my truest friend Where in the world do I begin


[Verse 2] 
I'm undone I'm speechless Overwhelmed by You Your love knows no limits And I'm the living proof


[Verse 3] 
Many times I drift away Still Your faithfulness remains You made this frozen river flow And I just want to let You know


[Verse 4] 
Words cannot tell You How much I love You All of the things that You are Lost in this ocean Of deepest devotion Lord You have captured my heart
