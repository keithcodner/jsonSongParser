[Verse 1] 
Holy Spirit flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me And make my life What it ought to be Holy Spirit flow through me


[Verse 2] 
Holy Spirit rest on me Holy Spirit rest on me And use me Lord To win the lost to Thee Holy Spirit rest on me


[Verse 3] 
Holy Spirit flow out from me Holy Spirit flow out from me That others Lord may see You in me Holy Spirit flow out from me
