[Verse 1] 
I've been redeemed By the blood of the Lamb I've been redeemed By the blood of the Lamb


[Verse 2] 
I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Saved and sanctified I am All my sins are under the blood I've been redeemed


[Verse 3] 
My Lord and I Have grown so close My Lord and I Have grown so close


[Verse 4] 
My Lord and I Have grown so close He baptised me in the Holy Ghost All my sins are under the blood I've been redeemed


[Verse 5] 
If you want to see the devil run If you wnat to see the devil run


[Verse 6] 
If you want to see the devil run Speak right out in Heavenly tongue All my sins are under the blood I've been redeemed
