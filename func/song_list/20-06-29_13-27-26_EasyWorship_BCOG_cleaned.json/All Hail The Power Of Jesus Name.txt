[Verse 1] 
And crown Him crown Him, Crown Him crown Him, And crown Him Lord of all.


[Verse 2] 
All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name, Let angels prostrate fall, Let angels prostrate fall, Bring forth the royal diadem.


[Verse 3] 
Ye chosen seed of Israel's race, Ye ransomed from the fall, Ye ransomed from the fall, Hail Him who saves you by His grace.


[Verse 4] 
Let every kindred ev'ry tribe, On this terrestrial ball, On this terrestrial ball, To Him all majesty ascribe.


[Verse 5] 
O that with yonder sacred throng, We at His feet may fall, We at His feet may fall, We'll join the everlasting song.
