[Verse 1] 
What hope we hold this starlit night A King is born in Bethlehem Our journey long We seek the light That leads to the hallowed manger ground


[Verse 2] 
What fear we felt in the silent age Four-hunderd years can He be found But broken by a baby's cry Rejoice in the hallowed manger ground


[Verse 3] 
Emmanuel Emmanuel God Incarnate here to dwell Emmanuel Emmanuel Praise His name Emmanuel


[Verse 4] 
The son of God Here born to bleed A crown of thorns would pierce His brow And we beheld this offering Exalted now the King of kings Praise God for the hallowed manger ground


[Verse 5] 
Emmanuel Emmanuel God Incarnate here to dwell Emmanuel Emmanuel Praise His name Emmanuel


[Verse 6] 
Oh, praise His name Emmanuel Oh, praise His name Emmanuel
