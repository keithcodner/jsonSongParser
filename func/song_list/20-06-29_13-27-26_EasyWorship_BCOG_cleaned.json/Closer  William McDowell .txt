[Verse 1] 
Into your arms I'm drawing near again To dwell with you Its my only heart's desire Its my only heart's desire


[Verse 2] 
All I can do Is fall on me knees and cry Cleanse me with fire And purify my heart


[Verse 3] 
Draw me close Closer than before Closer than I've ever been


[Verse 4] 
So take me to that place Lord, To that sercret place where I can be with you You can make me like you


[Verse 5] 
Wrap me in your arms Wrap me in your arms Wrap me in your arms
