The Lord reigns The Lord reigns The Lord reigns


[Verse 2] 
Let the earth rejoice Let the earth rejoice Let the earth rejoice

A fire goes before Him And burns up all His enemies The hill they melt like wax In the presence of the Lord In the presence of the Lord

The heavens declare His righteousness The people see His glory For You oh Lord are exalted Over all the earth Over all the earth
