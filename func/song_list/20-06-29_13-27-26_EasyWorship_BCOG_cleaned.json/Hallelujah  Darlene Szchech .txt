[Verse 1] 
He is here The Saviour has been born The one we've waited for Surrounded by our praises


[Verse 2] 
He is here The promise of the King To you our lives we bring Let your glory be revealed


[Verse 3] 
Joy to the World Peace to all who love him The Saviour has been born And all the heavens smile


[Verse 4] 
Glory to God We bring an offering to you Join with the angels Singing Hallelujah
