[Verse 1] 
Sweet Jesus my Savior you are my faithful friend You made me you know me you’ve seen my every sin My soul is amazed By the gift of your grace And the arms that take me Sweet Jesus my Savior you are my faithful friend


[Verse 2] 
Sweet Jesus my shelter you are my faithful friend The refuge I run to when the world comes closing in Why should I be afraid When I know I am saved By the arms that take me in Sweet Jesus my shelter you are my faithful friend


[Verse 3] 
Sweet Jesus my shepherd you are my faithful friend You hold me you lead me I’ll follow to the end And once more I will say On that beautiful day When your arms take me in Sweet Jesus my shepherd you are my faithful friend


[Verse 4] 
End Sweet Jesus my Savior you are my faithful friend
