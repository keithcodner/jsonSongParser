[Verse 1] 
I was hopeless, I knew I was lost Death and darkness were my only songs I needed someone to come rescue me Then mercy heard my plea


[Verse 2] 
Lord You found me, You healed me, You called me from the grave You gave me a real love, I thank You Jesus, You washed my sins away Oh now I’m living, like I’m forgiven, You came and set me free That’s what Your mercy did for me


[Verse 3] 
You gave me beauty for my guilty stains And now I’m living day to day by His grace So excuse me if I can’t contain my praise 'Cause I know that I’ve been saved


[Verse 4] 
Every morning mercy will restore me I will proclaim Even if the world may fall before me I will proclaim
