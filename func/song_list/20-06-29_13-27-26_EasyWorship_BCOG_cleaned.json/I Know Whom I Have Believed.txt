[Verse 1] 
But "I know whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed, Unto Him against that day."


[Verse 2] 
I know not why God's wondrous grace To me He hath made known; Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.


[Verse 3] 
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart, Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.


[Verse 4] 
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin, Revealing Jesus through the Word, Creating faith in Him.


[Verse 5] 
I know not what of good or ill May be reserved for me. Of weary ways or golden days, Before His face I see.


[Verse 6] 
I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair, Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.
