[Verse 1] 
O Great Light of the world Fill up my soul I'm half a man here So come make me whole O Great Light of the world Come to impart The light of Your grace To fill up my heart


[Verse 2] 
Sometimes at night When I am afraid I cover my eyes And I cover my shame So here in the dark Broken apart Come with Your light And fill up my heart


[Verse 3] 
The wind of this world Can push us around Folding us up Backing us down But here in the dark I'm not alone So come with Your strength And carry me home
