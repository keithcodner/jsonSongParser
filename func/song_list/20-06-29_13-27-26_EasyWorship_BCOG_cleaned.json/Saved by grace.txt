[Verse 1] 
Where would I be without Your grace ? I'd be lost without Your grace How could I live without Your grace? The life that I have is by Your grace


[Verse 2] 
Bridge: I am free, Im forgiven By Your work at calvary You gave me a life worth living Now the chains are broken Chains are broken


[Verse 3] 
I am saved by grace Love abounding, mercy found me I am saved by grace And I have life and its only by your grace ooh, ooh


[Verse 4] 
Mercy, the Mercy New every morning Amazing, every morning Your grace, your grace saved me oh oh woah X4


[Verse 5] 
Grace that brought me From a mighty long way, a mighty long way oooh Grace that kept me I'm alive today, and it's only by Your grace
