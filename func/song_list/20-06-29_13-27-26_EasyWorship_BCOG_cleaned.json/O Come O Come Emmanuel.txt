[Verse 1] 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel, Shall come to thee, O Israel!


[Verse 2] 
O come, O come Emmanuel And ransom captive Israel, That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear.


[Verse 3] 
O come, thou Wisdom from on high, And order all things far and nigh; To us the path of knowledge show And cause us in her ways to go.


[Verse 4] 
O come, O come, great Lord of might, Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height In ancient times once gave the law In cloud and majesty and awe.


[Verse 5] 
O come, thou Root of Jesse's tree, An ensign of Thy people be; Before Thee rulers silent fall; All peoples on Thy mercy call.


[Verse 6] 
O come, thou Key of David, come, And open wide our heavenly home. The captives from their prison free, And conquer death's deep misery.


[Verse 7] 
O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer Our spirits by Thy justice here; Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, And death's dark shadows put to flight.


[Verse 8] 
O come, Desire of nations bind All peoples in one heart and mind. From dust Thou brought us forth to life; Deliver us from earthly strife.
