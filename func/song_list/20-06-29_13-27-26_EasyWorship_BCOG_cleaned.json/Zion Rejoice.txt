[Verse 1] 
Let everything that hath praise the Lord Let every heartbeat praise in one accord Let every tongue, every tribe, everywhere Calling Zion to praise the Lord Caling Zion to praise the Lord


[Verse 2] 
Zion rejoice - Lift up your holy hands Zion rejoice - Hear the Father's command Zion rejoice, Zion rejoice Calling Zion to praise the Lord Calling Zion to praise the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Let all the people of God clap their hands Let all His children praise in the dance Let all His daughters and sons shout aloud Calling Zion to praise the Lord Calling Zion to praise the Lord
