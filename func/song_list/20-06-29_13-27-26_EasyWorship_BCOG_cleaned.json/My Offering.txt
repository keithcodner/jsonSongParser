[Verse 1] 
Here in my heart Forever grateful Is all my love Forever faithful Lord You're all I have all I need all I want


[Verse 2] 
My dearest friend My true companion You took me in Lost and abandoned Lord You're all I have all I need all I want


[Verse 3] 
And this is just a token of devotion To heaven's love as deep as any ocean


[Verse 4] 
All my life all my breath every word every step Every beat of my heart will sing Every joy every fear every smile every tear Is the least that my soul can bring It's my offering


[Verse 5] 
I can't explain This transformation But by Your Spirit I'm awakened Lord You're all I have all I need all I want


[Verse 6] 
I can't repay So great a mercy Poured out each day But I am learning Lord You're all I have all I need all I want
