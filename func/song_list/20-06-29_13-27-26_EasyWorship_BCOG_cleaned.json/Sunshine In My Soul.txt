[Verse 1] 
O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine, When the peaceful happy moments roll. When Jesus shows His smiling face, There is sunshine in my soul.


[Verse 2] 
There is sunshine in my soul today, More glorious and bright Than glows in any earthly sky, For Jesus is my light.


[Verse 3] 
There is music in my soul today, A carol to my King; And Jesus, listening can hear The songs I cannot sing.


[Verse 4] 
There is springtime in my soul today, For when the Lord is near The dove of peace sings in my heart, The flow'rs of grace appear.


[Verse 5] 
There is gladness in my soul today, And hope and praise and love, For blessings which He gives me now, For joys "laid up" above.
