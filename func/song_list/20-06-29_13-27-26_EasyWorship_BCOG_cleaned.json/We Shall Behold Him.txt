[Verse 1] 
And we shall behold Him We shall behold Him Face to face In all of His glory We shall behold Him We shall behold Him Face to face Our Savior and Lord


[Verse 2] 
The sky shall unfold Preparing His entrance The stars shall applaud Him With thunders of praise The sweet light in His eyes Shall enhance those awaiting And we shall behold Him Then face to face


[Verse 3] 
The angel shall sound The shout of His coming The sleeping shall rise From their slumbering place And those who remain Shall be changed in a moment And we shall behold Him Then face to face
