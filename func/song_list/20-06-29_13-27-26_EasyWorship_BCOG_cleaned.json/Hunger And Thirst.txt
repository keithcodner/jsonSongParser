[Verse 1] 
I hunger and thirst for You I hunger and thirst for You In the desert of my need You're the fountain that I seek You're the Living Water I keep running to I hunger and thirst for You I hunger and thirst for You


[Verse 2] 
I hunger and thirst for You I hunger and thirst for You Heaven's Manna Bread of Life Fill the emptiness inside Nothing else can satisfy me like You do I hunger and thirst for You I hunger and thirst for You
