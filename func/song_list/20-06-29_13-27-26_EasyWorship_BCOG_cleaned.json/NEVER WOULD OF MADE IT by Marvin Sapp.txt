[Verse 1] 
Never would have made it Never would have made it without You I would have lost it all But now I see how You were there for me


[Verse 2] 
And I can say Never would have made it Never could have made it without You


[Verse 3] 
I would have lost it all But I now I see How You were ther for me And I can say


[Verse 4] 
I'm stronger, I'm wiser I'm better, much better


[Verse 5] 
When I look back Over all You brought me through I can see that You were the one I held on to


[Verse 6] 
I never (Never would have made it) No, I never (Nevercould have made it without You)


[Verse 7] 
I am stonger (I am stronger) I am wiser (I am wiser)


[Verse 8] 
And now I am better (I am better) So much better (Much better)
