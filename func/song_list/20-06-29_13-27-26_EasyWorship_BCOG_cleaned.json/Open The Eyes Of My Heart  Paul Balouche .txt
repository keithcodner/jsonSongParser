[Verse 1] 
Open the eyes of my heart Lord Open the eyes of my heart I want to see You I want to see You


[Verse 2] 
To see You high and lifted up Shining in the light of Your glory Pour out Your power and love As we sing holy holy holy


[Verse 3] 
Holy holy holy Holy holy holy Holy holy holy I want to see You
