[Verse 1] 
My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' Blood and Righteousness I dare not trust the sweetest frame But wholly lean on Jesus' Name


[Verse 2] 
On Christ the solid rock I stand All other ground is sinking sand All other ground is sinking sand


[Verse 3] 
When darkness veils His lovely face I rest on His unchanging grace In every high and stormy gale My anchor holds within the veil


[Verse 4] 
His oath, His covenant, His Blood Support me in the whelming flood When all around my soul gives way He then is all my hope and stay
