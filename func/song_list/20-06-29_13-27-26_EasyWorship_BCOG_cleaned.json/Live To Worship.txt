[Verse 1] 
We will live to worship Give You praise with all our hearts For all our days Father we want to do what You created us to We will live to worship You


[Verse 2] 
A simple offering is all that we bring We give our lives claim You as King We are Your servants and before You we bow With ev'ry breath we make this vow


[Verse 3] 
Our ev'ry moment is a gift of Your grace We are all Yours now and always More than just words O Lord The cry of our hearts Is to let our lives speak of how great You are


[Verse 4] 
For You are worthy You alone are deserving You are holy You alone are deserving


[Verse 5] 
Holy worthy Holy worthy Lord We will live to worship You
