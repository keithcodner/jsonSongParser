[Verse 1] 
A Saviour on a hill Dying for my shame could this be true? Defies the world I see Yet this is all my heart was longing for to know You my Lord To know You Lord


[Verse 2] 
You deserve You deserve You deserve all the praise You deserve You deserve You deserve all the praise


[Verse 3] 
The heavens wept for You The earth cried out could He be the one For You so loved the world You gave Your only Son to say I love you so Oh how I love you so


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah to the King Hallelujah we will sing forever


[Verse 5] 
And all humanity Aches to find this beautiful love You give We come to You again To offer up our lives to worship You alone To worship You alone
