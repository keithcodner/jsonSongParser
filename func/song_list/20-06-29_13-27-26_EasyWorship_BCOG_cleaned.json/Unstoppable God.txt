[Verse 1] 
Heaven thundered And the world was born Life begins and ends In the dust You formed


[Verse 2] 
Unstoppable God Let Your glory go on and on Impossible things In Your name they shall be done Faith commanded And the mountains moved Fear is losing ground To our hope in You


[Verse 3] 
Freedom conquered All our chains undone Sin defeated Jesus has overcome Mercy triumphed When the third day dawned Darkness was denied When the stone was gone (oh)


[Verse 4] 
Unstoppable God Let Your glory go on and on Impossible things In Your name they shall be done


[Verse 5] 
Nothing shall be impossible Your kingdom reigns unstoppable We'll shout Your praise forevermore Jesus our God unstoppable (oh)


[Verse 6] 
Unstoppable God Let Your glory go on and on Impossible things In Your name they shall be done (oh)
