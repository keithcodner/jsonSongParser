[Verse 1] 
Father, I'm weak and I'm broken In need of healing, I'm coming to You.


[Verse 2] 
I've been wounded because I pretended. Oh, Lord, I've squandered My inheritance.


[Verse 3] 
So here I am, A person without status or even a name Would you reclaim me?


[Verse 4] 
Lord, lead my heart Lord, lead my heart Lord, lead my heart And I'll follow You
