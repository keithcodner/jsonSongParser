Beautiful Lord, Wonderful Saviour I know for sure, all of my days are held in your hands crafted into your perfect plan


[Verse 2] 
You gently call me into your presence Guiding me by your Holy Spirit Teach me dear Lord to live all of my life Through your eyes

I'm captured by your holy calling Set me apart, I know you're drawing me to yourself Lead me Lord I pray

Call me, guide, lead me, walk beside me I give my life to the potter's hand


[Verse 6] 
I give my life to the potter's hand
