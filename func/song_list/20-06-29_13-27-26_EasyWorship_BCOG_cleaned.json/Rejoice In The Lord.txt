[Verse 1] 
Rejoice in the Lord And again I say rejoice


[Verse 2] 
Your kindness abounds to the ends of the earth Your grace and Your mercy Surrounds us Oh Lord Your Name is exalted 'cause You are Lord of all


[Verse 3] 
So come to the river And drink from the water of life


[Verse 4] 
You're a Mighty God You're an Awesome God You're a Healing God You're a Sovereign God


[Verse 5] 
Mighty God Awesome God Healing God Sovereign God


[Verse 6] 
Oh weh Oh weh Oh Oh weh Oh weh Oh
