[Verse 1] 
Tell me what can I do cause I can't live without I can't live without you


[Verse 2] 
So here's my heart here's my mind I give you my soul Need you to take control


[Verse 3] 
Cause I've tried it Tried it on my own but What I found is I can't make it


[Verse 4] 
On my own On my own


[Verse 5] 
I can't make it I can't make it


[Verse 6] 
Oooh


[Verse 7] 
I can't walk without you I can't talk without you I can't sing without you I'm nothing without you


[Verse 8] 
I can't live without you I can't breathe without you I can't be without you There's no me without you
