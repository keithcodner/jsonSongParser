[Verse 1] 
Silent night, holy night, All is calm, all is bright. Round yon virgin mother and child; Holy infant, so tender and mild, Sleep in heavenly peace; Sleep in heavenly peace.


[Verse 2] 
Silent night, holy night, Shepherds quake at the sight. Glories stream from heaven afar, Heavenly hosts sing "Alleluia. Christ the Savior is born; Christ the Savior is born."


[Verse 3] 
Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light. Radiant beams from Thy holy face, With the dawn of redeeming grace. Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth; Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.


[Verse 4] 
Silent night, holy night, Wondrous star, lend thy light. With the angels, let us sing, Alleluia to our King. Christ the Savior is born; Christ the Savior is born.
