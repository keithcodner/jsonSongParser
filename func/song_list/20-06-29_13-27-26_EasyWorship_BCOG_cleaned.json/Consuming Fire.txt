[Verse 1] 
And yes our God He is a consuming fire And the flames burn down deep in my soul Yes our God He is a consuming fire He reaches inside and He melts down This cold heart of stone


[Verse 2] 
Set this place on fire Send Your Spirit Savior Rescue from the mire Show Your servant favor Well yesterday was a day that I was alone Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God


[Verse 3] 
Did you realize that inside of you There is a flame Did you ever try to let it burn Let it burn let it burn
