[Verse 1] 
The truth can hurt you or the truth can change you what would truth do to you


[Verse 2] 
I just wanna be happy but if I keep on doing the things that keep on bringing me pain there's no one else I can blame


[Verse 3] 
If I'm not happy wasted time but now I can see the biggest enemy, it was me so I'm not happy


[Verse 4] 
cry yourself to sleep shout and raise your hands it won't change thing child untill you understand (preach)


[Verse 5] 
if you're tired of being the same if you're tired of things not changing it's time for you to get out the way


[Verse 6] 
don't get stuck in how you feel say Jesus take the wheel he knows the road that you need to take (but it only works if)


[Verse 7] 
if you wanna be happy (look at yourself and say) don't you wanna be happy


[Verse 8] 
I just wanna be happy but if i keep on giving my heart for people to tear apart the healing will never start so I can be happy will I ever be happy


[Verse 9] 
cry yourself to sleep shout and raise your hands it won't change thing child untill you understand


[Verse 10] 
if you're tired of being the same if you're tired of things not changing it's time for you to get out the way


[Verse 11] 
don't get stuck in how you feel say Jesus take the wheel he knows the road that you need to take


[Verse 12] 
it's so easy to complain addicted to the pain you give your heart, they push it away


[Verse 13] 
Jesus knows just how you feel just let him take the wheel the love you need, he already gave


[Verse 14]

[Verse 15] 
Let me hear you say yeah yeah yeah Let me hear you say yeah yeah yeah (2x)
