[Verse 1] 
I'm learning to lean Learning to lean Learning to lean on Jesus Finding more power Than I'd ever dreamed I'm learning to lean on Jesus


[Verse 2] 
The joy I can't explain fills my soul Since the day I made Jesus my King His blessed Holy Spirit is leading my way He's teaching and I'm learning to lean


[Verse 3] 
Sometimes we can be like the man who said My life is full now I have ev'rything But there is a strong Rock in Jesus my Lord Thro' my trials I've been learning to lean


[Verse 4] 
Sad broken hearted so often I've knelt And I've found God's peace so serene And all that He asks is a child-like trust And a heart that is learning to lean


[Verse 5] 
There's glorious vict'ry each day now for me I found His peace so serene He helps me with each task if only I'll ask Ev'ry day now I'm learning to lean
