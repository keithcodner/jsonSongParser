[Verse 1] 
My Jesus I love Thee; I know Thou art mine. For Thee all the follies Of sin I resign. My gracious Redeemer, My Savior art Thou. If ever I loved Thee, My Jesus, 'tis now.


[Verse 2] 
I love Thee, Because Thou hast first loved me, And purchased my pardon On Calvary's tree. I love Thee For wearing the thorns On Thy brow, If ever I loved Thee, My Jesus, 'tis now.


[Verse 3] 
I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death, And praise Thee As long as Thou lendest me breath; And say when the death dew Lies cold on my brow, "If ever I loved Thee, My Jesus 'tis now."


[Verse 4] 
In mansions of glory And endless delight, I'll ever adore Thee In heaven so bright. I'll sing with the glittering crown On my brow, "If ever I loved Thee, My Jesus, 'tis now."
