[Verse 1] 
Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand, The shadow of a mighty Rock Within a weary land. A home within the wilderness, A rest upon the way, From the burning of the noontide heat And the burden of the day.


[Verse 2] 
Upon the cross of Jesus Mine eyes at times can see The very dying form of One Who suffered there for me; And from my smitten heart with tears Two wonders I confess: The wonders of redeeming love And my unworthiness.


[Verse 3] 
I take, O cross, thy shadow For my abiding place, I ask no other sunshine Than the sunshine of His face. Content to let the world go by, To know no gain nor loss, My sinful self, my only shame, My glory all the cross.


[Verse 4] 
O safe and happy shelter, O refuge tried and sweet, O trysting place where heaven's love And heaven's justice meet! As to the holy patriarch That wondrous dream was giv'n, So seems my Savior's cross to me, A ladder up to heav'n.
