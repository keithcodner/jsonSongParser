[Verse 1] 
In humble adoration I knell before Your home In brokenness I seek Your face alone Above You there's no other Who's able to restore my soul


[Verse 2] 
Breathe on me Power of God come in and change me You are all I need Holy Spirit breathe on me


[Verse 3] 
I'm ready to surrender To give You all my life No matter whar the cost or sacrifice Reveal to me Your calling Cleanse me from my prideful ways Use me now I pray


[Verse 4] 
Breathe on me Power of God come in and change me You are all I need Holy Spirit breathe on me


[Verse 5] 
I will say of the Lord He is my strong tower My rock and my fortress in whom I trust In times of the storm and tribulation He is my help and my salvation


[Verse 6] 
Oh breath of God Restore my soul


[Verse 7] 
I will say of the Lord He is my strong tower My rock and my fortress in whom I trust In times of the storm and in tribulation He is my help and my salvation


[Verse 8] 
Breath on me Power of God come in and change me You are all I need Holy Spirit breathe on me


[Verse 9] 
I need Thee how I need Thee Every hour I need Thee O Bless me now my Saviour I come to Thee
