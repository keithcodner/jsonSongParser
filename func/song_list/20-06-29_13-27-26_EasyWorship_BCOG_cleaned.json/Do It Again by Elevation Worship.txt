[Verse 1] 
Walking around these walls I thought by now they'd fall But You have never failed me yet Waiting for change to come Knowing the battle's won For You have never failed me yet


[Verse 2] 
Your promise still stands Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness I'm still in Your hands This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet


[Verse 3] 
I know the night won't last Your Word will come to pass My heart will sing Your praise again Jesus, You're still enough Keep me within Your love My heart will sing Your praise again


[Verse 4] 
I've seen You move, You move the mountains And I believe, I'll see You do it again


[Verse 5] 
You made a way, where there was no way And I believe, I'll see You do it again
