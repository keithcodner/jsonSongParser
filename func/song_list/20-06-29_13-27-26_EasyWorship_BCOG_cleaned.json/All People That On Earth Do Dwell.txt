[Verse 1] 
All people that on earth do dwell, Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice; Him serve with fear His praise forth tell, Come ye before Him and rejoice.


[Verse 2] 
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed, Without our aid He did us make; We are His flock, He doth us fee And for His sheep He doth us take.


[Verse 3] 
O, enter then His gates with praise, Approach with joy His courts unto; Praise laud and bless His name always, For it is seemly so to do.


[Verse 4] 
For why the Lord our God is good, His mercy is forever sure; His truth at all times firmly stood, And shall from age to age endure.


[Verse 5] 
Praise God from whom All blessings flow. Praise Him All creatures here below. Praise Him above Ye heav'nly host. Praise Father, Son, And Holy Ghost.
