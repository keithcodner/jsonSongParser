[Verse 1] 
Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of hosts Heav'n and earth are full of Thee; Heav'n and earth are praising Thee, O Lord, Most High.


[Verse 2] 
Day is dying in the west Heav'n is touching earth with rest; Wait and worship while the night Sets her ev'ning lamps alight, Thro' all the sky.


[Verse 3] 
Lord of life, beneath the dome, Of the universe Thy home; Gather us who seek Thy face, To the fold of Thy embrace For Thou art nigh.


[Verse 4] 
While the deep'ning shadows fall Heart of love enfolding all, Thro' the glory and the grace Of the stars that veil Thy face; Our hearts ascend.


[Verse 5] 
When forever from our sight, Pass the stars the day; The night Lord of angels, On our eyes let eternal morning rise, And shadows end.
