[Verse 1] 
Hallelujah! Thine the glory! Hallelujah! Amen! Hallelujah! Thine the glory! Revive us again.


[Verse 2] 
We praise Thee, O God, For the Son of Thy love; For Jesus, who died And is now gone above.


[Verse 3] 
We praise Thee, O God, For Thy Spirit of light, Who has shown us our Savior And scattered our night.


[Verse 4] 
All glory and praise To the Lamb that was slain, Who has borne all our sins And hath cleansed every stain.


[Verse 5] 
Revive us again; Fill each heart with Thy love; May each soul be rekindled With fire from above.
