[Verse 1] 
I will exalt You. I will exalt You. I will exalt You. You are my God.


[Verse 2] 
My hiding place, my safe refuge; My treasure, Lord, You are. My friend and King, anointed One Most Holy.


[Verse 3] 
Because you're with me, I will not fear.


[Verse 4] 
Because your with me, I will not fear.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, oh, oh, oh I will not fear.
