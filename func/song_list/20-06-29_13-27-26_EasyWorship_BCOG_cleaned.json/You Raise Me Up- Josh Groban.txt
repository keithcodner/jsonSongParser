[Verse 1] 
When I am down and Oh my soul so weary When troubles come and my heart burdened be, Then I am still and wait here in the silence Until you come and sit awhile with me


[Verse 2] 
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains You raise me up to walk on stormy seas I am strong, when I am on your shoulders You raise me up... To more than I can be


[Verse 3] 
There is no life- no life without its hunger Each restless heart beats so imperfectly, But when you come and I am filled with wonder, Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity


[Verse 4] 
You raise me up... To more than I can be
