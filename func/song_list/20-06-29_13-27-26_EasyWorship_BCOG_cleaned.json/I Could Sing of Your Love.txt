[Verse 1] 
Over the mountains and the sea Your river runs with love for me So I will open up my heart And let the healer set me free I'm happy to be in the truth For I will daily lift my hands For I will always sing Of when Your love came down


[Verse 2] 
I could sing of your love forever I could sing of your love forever


[Verse 3] 
Though I feel like dancing It's foolishness I know But when the world has seen the light They will dance with joy Like we're dancing now
