[Verse 1] 
I am thirsty I am needy I am wanting more and more of You


[Verse 2] 
There is a mansion in heaven Where the King of Glory He dwells And there is a banqueting table That the Father and His Son has prepared


[Verse 3] 
Where angels bow And elders throw their crowns And beast of the fields And the birds of the air They will shout


[Verse 4] 
Fill this house with Your glory Fill this place with Your praise Fill this house with Your presence Ancient of Days


[Verse 5] 
There is a mansion in heaven Where the King of Glory He dwells And there is a banqueting table That the Father and His Son has prepared


[Verse 6] 
I bow down And I throw down my crown And with the beasts of the fields And the birds of the air I will shout


[Verse 7] 
Fill my life with Your glory Fill my heart with Your love Fill my soul with Your presence I can't get enough


[Verse 8] 
I am thirsty I am needy I am wanting more and more of You
