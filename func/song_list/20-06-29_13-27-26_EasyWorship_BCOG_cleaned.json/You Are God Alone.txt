[Verse 1] 
You're not a God created by human hands You're not a God dependant on any mortal man You are not a God in need of Anything we can give By Your plan That's just the way it is


[Verse 2] 
You are God alone From before time began You were on Your throne You are God alone And right now in the good times and bad You are on Your throne You are God alone


[Verse 3] 
You're the only God whose power none can contend You're the only God whose name and Praise will never end You're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give You are God That's just the way it is


[Verse 4] 
You are God alone From before time began You were on Your throne You are God alone And right now in the good times and bad You are on Your throne You are God alone


[Verse 5] 
You're unchangeable Unshakeable Unstoppable That's who You are
