[Verse 1] 
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer. With His blood He purchased me. On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free.


[Verse 2] 
I will sing of my Redeemer, And His wondrous love to me. On the cruel cross He suffered, From the curse to set me free.


[Verse 3] 
I will tell the wondrous story, How my lost estate to save, In His boundless love and mercy He the ransom freely gave.


[Verse 4] 
I will praise my dear Redeemer; His triumphant power I'll tell, How the victory He giveth Over sin and death and hell.


[Verse 5] 
I will sing of my Redeemer And His heavenly love to me; He from death to life hath brought me, Son of God, with Him to be.
