[Verse 1] 
The advent of our God, With eager hearts we greet; And we must praise Him in this hour, With hymns and anthems sweet.


[Verse 2] 
All glory to the Son, Who comes to set us free; With Father, Spirit ever One, Through all eternity.


[Verse 3] 
The everlasting Son, Incarnate stoops to be; Himself the servant's form Puts on to set his people free.


[Verse 4] 
Come, Zion's daughter, Rise to meet your lowly King; Nor let your faithless heart despise The peace He comes to bring.


[Verse 5] 
As judge, on clouds of light, He soon will come again; And all His scattered saints Unite with Him on high to reign.


[Verse 6] 
Before the dawning day Let sin be put to flight; No longer let the law hold sway, But walk in freedom's light.
