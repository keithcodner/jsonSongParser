[Verse 1] 
We're the people of God Called by His name Called from the dark And delivered from shame One holy race saints ev'ryone Because of the blood Of Christ Jesus the Son


[Verse 2] 
With our lips Let us sing one confession With our hearts Hold to one truth alone For He has erased our transgression Claimed us and called us His own His very own


[Verse 3] 
Hear us O spirits of darkness So you will know where we stand We are His servants purchased with scars Bought by the blood of the Lamb The blood of the Lamb
