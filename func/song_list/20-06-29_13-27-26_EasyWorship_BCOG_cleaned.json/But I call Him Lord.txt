[Verse 1] 
Master, Redeemer, Savior of the world. Wonderful, Counselor, Bright Morning Star. Lily of the valley, Provider, and Friend, He was yesterday, He'll be tomorrow, Beginning and End.


[Verse 2] 
But the angel called Him Jesus, born of a virgin. Mary called Him Jesus, but I call Him Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Verse ah, Messiah, Mighty God and King. Bread of Life, lasting words of love that I sing. Light and darkness, Door to heaven, my home in the sky, The Fountain of Living Water that never shall run dry.
