[Verse 1] 
He's able He's able I know He's able I know my God is able to carry me through


[Verse 2] 
For He heals the broken hearted And set the captives free He made the lame to walk again And cause the blind to see


[Verse 3] 
I know He's able He's able I know He's able I know my God is able to carry me through
