[Verse 1] 
Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens And the earth by Thy great power; Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens And the earth by Thine outstretched arm


[Verse 2] 
Nothing is too difficult for Thee, Nothing is too difficult for Thee; O, great and mighty God, Great in power and mighty in deed, Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing, Nothing is too difficult for Thee
