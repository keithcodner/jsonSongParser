[Verse 1] 
Christ in us be glorified Christ in us be lifted high Let his love in us be shown And his praises be known Let christ be glorified Let christ be glorified


[Verse 2] 
With every song we sing And the praises that we bring Let christ be glorified In the service that we give And the lives that we live Let christ be glorified


[Verse 3] 
Christ in us be glorified Christ in us be Magnified Self Denied sin crusified Let christ be glorified Let christ be glorified
