[Verse 1] 
Even so Come, Lord Jesus, come Even so Come and take your Bride away How my soul Longs to be with You, my Lord Even so Even so Come, Lord Jesus, come


[Verse 2] 
Lord You are The lover of my soul Lord You are Exalted over all And I bow before Your throne To worship You Lord You are Lord You are The lover of my soul
