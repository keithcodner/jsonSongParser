[Verse 1] 
My soul be on thy guard; Ten thousand foes arise; The hosts of sin are pressing hard To draw you from the skies.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, watch and fight and pray; The battle ne'er give o'er. Renew it boldly ev'ry day, And help divine implore.


[Verse 3] 
Ne'er think the vict'ry won, Nor lay thine armor down; The work of faith will not be done Till thou obtain the crown.


[Verse 4] 
Fight on, my soul, till death Shall bring thee to thy God; He'll take thee, at thy parting breath, To His divine abode.
