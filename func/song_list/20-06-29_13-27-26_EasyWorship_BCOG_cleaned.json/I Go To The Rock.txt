[Verse 1] 
I go to the Rock of my salvation Go to the Stone That the builder rejected Run to the Mountain And the Mountain stands by me The earth all around me is sinking sand On Christ the solid Rock I stand When I need a shelter When I need a friend I go to the Rock


[Verse 2] 
Where do I go When there's no one else to turn to Who do I talk to When no one wants to listen Who do I lean on When there's no foundation stable I go to the Rock I know that's able I go to the Rock


[Verse 3] 
Where do I hide 'Til the storms have all passed over Where do I run to When the winds of sorrow threaten Is there a refuge In the time of tribulation When my soul needs consolation I go to the Rock
