[Verse 1] 
Here I am Here I stand Lord, my life is in your hands Lord, I'm longing to see your desires revealed in me


[Verse 2] 
I give myself away I give myself away So You can use me


[Verse 3] 
Take my heart Take my life As a living sacrifice All my dreams All my plans Lord, I place them in your hands


[Verse 4] 
My life is not my own To you I belong I give myself I give myself to you
