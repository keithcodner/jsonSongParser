[Verse 1] 
Pressing on, we're pressing on Pressing on, we're pressing on


[Verse 2] 
Pressing on, oh yes we're pressing on Pressing on, we're pressing on


[Verse 3] 
Waiting on Jesus to answer our call we're holding on Faith as our comfort, believing it's done we're pressing on


[Verse 4] 
Don't be discouraged, by what's gone wrong All of our problems, belong to God


[Verse 5] 
Praying and fasting and growing strong, we're pressing on Faith as our comfort, believing it's done we're pressing on
