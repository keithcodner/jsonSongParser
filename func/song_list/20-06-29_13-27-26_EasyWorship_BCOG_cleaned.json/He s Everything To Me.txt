[Verse 1] 
He's ev'rything to me. From sin He sets me free; His peace and love my portion Thro' all eternity! He's ev'rything to me, More than I dreamed could be. O praise His name forever! He's ev'rything to me.


[Verse 2] 
In sin I once had wandered, All weary, sad and lone, Till Jesus through His mercy Adopted me His own. Ever since I learned to trust Him, His grace doth make me free, And now I feel His pardon, He's everything to me.


[Verse 3] 
In sin no more I'll wander; He's Pilot, Friend and Guide. He brings me joy and singing. His Spirit doth abide. A blessed, loving Savior, The Lamb of Calvary! He purchased my redemption. He's ev'rything to me.


[Verse 4] 
No longer will I stray From His tender, loving care; Like Him to be my purpose, My aim, my constant prayer. And when He bids me welcome Thro'out eternity, I'll praise His name forever. He's ev'rything to me.
