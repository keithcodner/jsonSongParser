[Verse 1] 
It is glory, just to walk with Him. It is glory, just to walk with Him. He will guide my steps aright, Thro' the vale and o'er the height. It is glory, just to walk with Him.


[Verse 2] 
It is glory, just to walk with Him, Whose blood has ransomed me. It is rapture for my soul each day, It is joy divine to feel, To feel Him near. Where'er my path may be, Bless the Lord, It's glory all the way.


[Verse 3] 
It is glory when the shadows fall, To know that He is near. Oh what joy to simply trust and pray, It is glory to abide in Him. When skies above are clear, Yes, with Him it's glory all the way.


[Verse 4] 
'Twill be glory when I walk, With Him on heaven's golden shore. Never from His side again to stray, 'Twill be glory, wondrous glory, With the Savior evermore, Everlasting glory all the way.
