[Verse 1] 
Each and every day I will seek your face My soul is crying out For more I want more of You I won't be satisfied nor content of where I am So I will apprehend til I'm captured by what I'm after


[Verse 2] 
And I will go From faith to faith From glory to glory


[Verse 3] 
And I'll forever be chasing after you I'll be chasing after you


[Verse 4] 
i will press towards the mark For the prize and I won't faint There's one thing I desire and that's what i'm going for I can't continue life, day by day, growing dry I ned to be with you - Jesus I'll seek where you are
