[Verse 1] 
As I come into Your presence Past the gates of praise Into Your sanctuary 'Till we're standing face to face I look upon Your countenance I see the full ness of Your grace And I can only bow down and say


[Verse 2] 
You are awesome in this place Mighty God You are awesome in this place Abba Father


[Verse 3] 
You are worthy of all praise To You our lives we raise You are awesome in this place Mighty God
