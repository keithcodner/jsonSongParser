[Verse 1] 
His yoke is easy His burden is light, I've found it so I've found it so, His service is my sweetest delight, His blessings ever flow.


[Verse 2] 
I've found my Lord and He is mine, He won me by His love, I'll serve Him all my years of time, And dwell with Him above.


[Verse 3] 
No other Lord but Christ I know, I walk with Him alone, His streams of love forever flow, Within my heart His throne.


[Verse 4] 
He's dearer to my heart than life, He found me lost in sin, He calmed the sea of inward strife, And bid me come to Him.


[Verse 5] 
My flesh recoiled before the cross, And Satan whispers there, Thy gain will not repay the loss, His yoke is hard to bear.


[Verse 6] 
I've tried the road of sin and found, Its prospects all deceive, I've proved the Lord and joys abound, More than I could believe.
