[Verse 1] 
Come and let us sing Come and let us sing Come and let us sing To the King of Kings


[Verse 2] 
Enter His gates with thanksgiving Enter His courts with praise


[Verse 3] 
He's worthy to be praised Exalt His holy name Glory and honor Majesty and power


[Verse 4] 
Come and let us shout Come and let us shout Come and let us shout To the Lord our God


[Verse 5] 
Come and let us dance Come and let us dance Come and let us dance Lift up holy hands
