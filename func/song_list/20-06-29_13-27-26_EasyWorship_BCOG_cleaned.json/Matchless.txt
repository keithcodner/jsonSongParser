[Verse 1] 
Your name is matchless Your name is priceless Your name means more Than I could know You're so far above me The way that You love me Goes further than any love could go


[Verse 2] 
Son of Man Great I Am King of Heaven Son of God You hold the measure of my days Holy Lamb spotless Lamb You are worthy I am not Before Your throne I stand amazed


[Verse 3] 
Every tongue confess And every knee will bow To Jesus Christ the Lord forever Hear our praises now


[Verse 4] 
Wonderful Counselor Root of David Morning Star You are the Way the Truth the Life Lion of the tribe of Judah Mighty God is who You are The only perfect sacrifice


[Verse 5] 
In Your name You took the blind man And You gave him back his sight In Your name You took the dead man And You brought him back to life In Your name You took this prisoner And You opened up the doors And I will sing before Your throne forever more
