[Verse 1] 
The more I seek you The more I Find you The more I Find you The more I Love you


[Verse 2] 
I wanna sit at your feet Drink from the cup in your hand Lay back against you and breathe Feel your heartbeat


[Verse 3] 
This love is so deep It's more than I can stand I melt in your peace It's overwhelming
