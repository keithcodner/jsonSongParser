[Verse 1] 
Now I'm nowhere close to a perfect man And it takes a supernatural love to even understand That beyond the walls behind, the mask and confident smile, Was a broken man trying to grow up and make life worthwhile,


[Verse 2] 
And I know there were times that you probably shouldn't, But I thank you for always lovin' me And I know anyone else they probably wouldn't, So I thank you for always lovin' me


[Verse 3] 
Now I know there were days I looked at myself, I felt like less of a person compared to everyone else, What about this flaw to big to small, can I exchange? And trying to make-up for where I fell short, I let sense slip away


[Verse 4] 
And when I look in the mirror and don't like what I see Oh, I just thank you for always lovin' me. And I know I get bad but you wait patiently I just want to thank you for always lovin' me.


[Verse 5] 
Lord I just thank you for always lovin' me (2x)


[Verse 6] 
So you just keep lovin' me (lovin' me) (4x)


[Verse 7] 
Though I know I don't have everything that it takes you keep lovin' me (lovin' me) And regardless of every mistake that I make, you keep (lovin' me) And it probably don't matter what I do or say, you keep (lovin' me) And even with the pimples on my face, you keep (lovin' me)


[Verse 8] 
So you just keep lovin' me Lord I thank you for lovin' me (lovin' me) Lord I thank you for lovin' me (lovin' me) This little imperfect man Lord I thank you for always lovin' me!
