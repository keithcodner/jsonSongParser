[Verse 1] 
They've taken Christ from Christmas FIlled it with earthly joys Like frosty and Rudolph Even a drummer boy


[Verse 2] 
They need to know that Christ is Christmas They need to know that Christ is Christmas Sent down to save the world from sin That's why he came my friend They really need to know


[Verse 3] 
They've talem Christ from Christmas Replaced him with toys and games The world really needs to know That's not why he came


[Verse 4] 
They need to know that Christ is Christmas They need to know that Christ is Christmas Sent down to save the world from sin That's why he came my friend They really need to know


[Verse 5] 
They need to know he came to save the world Sent down to save every precious boy and girl Sent down to save the world from sin That's why he came my friend That really need to know
