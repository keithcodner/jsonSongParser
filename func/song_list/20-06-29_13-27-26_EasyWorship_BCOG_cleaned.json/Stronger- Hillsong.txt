[Verse 1] 
There is love that came for us Humbled to a sinners cross You broke my shame and sinfulness You rose again victorious


[Verse 2] 
Faithfullness none can deny Through the storm and through the fire There is truth that sets me free Jesus Christ who lives in me


[Verse 3] 
You are stronger You are stronger Sin is broken, You have saved me It is written, Christ is risen Jesus, You are Lord of all


[Verse 4] 
I am stronger I am stronger Sin is broken You have saved me It is written, Christ is risen Jesus, You are Lord of all


[Verse 5] 
No beginning and no end You're my hope and my defence You came to seek and save the lost You paid it all upon the cross


[Verse 6] 
You are stronger You are stronger Sin is broken, You have saved me It is written, Christ is risen Jesus, You are Lord of all


[Verse 7] 
So let Your name be lifted higher Be lifted higher Be lifted higher So let Your name be lifted higher Be lifted higher Be lifted higher
