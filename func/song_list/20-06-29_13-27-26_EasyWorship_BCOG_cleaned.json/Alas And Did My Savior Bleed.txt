[Verse 1] 
Alas, and did my Savior bleed And did my Sovereign die? Would He devote that sacred head, For such a worm as I.


[Verse 2] 
Was it for crimes that I have done, He suffered on the tree? Amazing pity, grace unknown, And love beyond degree!


[Verse 3] 
Well might the sun in darkness hide And shut His glories in; When Christ the mighty Maker died For man, the creature's sin.


[Verse 4] 
Thus might I hide my blushing face While His dear cross appears; Dissolve my heart in thankfulness And melt mine eyes to tears.


[Verse 5] 
But drops of grief can ne'er repay, The debt of love I owe; Here, Lord, I give myself away, 'Tis all that I can do.
