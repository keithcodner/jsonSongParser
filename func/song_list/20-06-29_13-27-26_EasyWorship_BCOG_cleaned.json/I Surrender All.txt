[Verse 1] 
I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee my blessed Savior, I surrender all.


[Verse 2] 
All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give; I will ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live.


[Verse 3] 
All to Jesus I surrender, Humbly at His feet I bow, Worldly pleasures all forsaken, Take me Jesus take me now.


[Verse 4] 
All to Jesus I surrender, Make me Savior wholly Thine; Let me feel the Holy Spirit, Truly know that Thou art mine.


[Verse 5] 
All to Jesus I surrender, Lord I give myself to Thee. Fill me with Thy love and power; Let Thy blessings fall on me.


[Verse 6] 
All to Jesus I surrender, Now I feel the sacred flame. Oh the joy of full salvation! Glory, glory to His name!
