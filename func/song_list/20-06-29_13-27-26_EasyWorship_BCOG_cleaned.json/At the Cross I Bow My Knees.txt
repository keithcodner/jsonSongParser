[Verse 1] 
Oh Lord, You searched me You know my ways Even when I fail You I know You love me


[Verse 2] 
Your Holy presence Surrounding me In every season I know You love me I know You love me


[Verse 3] 
At the cross I bow my knees Where Your blood was shed for me There's no greater love than this


[Verse 4] 
You have overcome the grave Glory fills the highest place What can separate me now


[Verse 5] 
You tore the veil You made a way When You said that it is done
