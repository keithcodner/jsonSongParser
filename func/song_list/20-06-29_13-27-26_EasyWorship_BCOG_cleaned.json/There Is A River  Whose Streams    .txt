[Verse 1] 
There is a river whose streams Make glad the city of our God


[Verse 2] 
I will rejoice I will rejoice And be glad


[Verse 3] 
There is a fountain full of grace And it flows from Emmanuel's veins It came and it healed me It came and refreshed me It came and washed my sins away


[Verse 4] 
He has made me glad He has made me glad I will rejoice


[Verse 5] 
You have made me glad You have made me glad I will rejoice
