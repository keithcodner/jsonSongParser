[Verse 1] 
I'm pressing on the upward way New heights I'm gaining every day Still praying as I'm onward bound Lord plant my feet on higher grounds


[Verse 2] 
Lord lift me up and let me stand By faith on heavens stable land A higher plain than I've found Lord plant my feet on higher grounds


[Verse 3] 
My heart has no desire to stay Where doubts arise and fears dismay Through some may dwell where these abound My prayer my aim is higher ground
