[Verse 1] 
Tell the blessed story, of the cross of Jesus. Tell the blessed story, of the hallowed cross. Until every nation, learns of full salvation. Tell the blessed story of the cross.


[Verse 2] 
Church of God awaken, heed the Lord's command. Tell the blessed story of the cross. Fields are white for harvesting, on ev'ry hand. Tell the blessed story of the cross.


[Verse 3] 
Has He not commissioned you, the news to bear. Tell the blessed story of the cross. Go ye into all the world, and ev'rywhere Tell the blessed story of the cross.


[Verse 4] 
Stand no longer idle, while the moments fly. Tell the blessed story of the cross. Multitudes in heathen darkness live and die. Tell the blessed story of the cross.


[Verse 5] 
Publish unto all the world redeeming grace. Tell the blessed story of the cross. Until in the home of rest you find your place, Tell the blessed story of the cross.
