[Verse 1] 
God of wonders beyond our galaxy You are holy holy The universe declares Your majesty You are holy holy Lord of heaven and earth Lord of heaven and earth Lord of heaven and earth

Early in the morning I will celebrate the light And as I stumble in the darkness I will call Your name by night


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth
