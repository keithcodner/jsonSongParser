[Verse 1] 
You hold my every moment You calm my raging seas You walk with me through fire And heal all my disease


[Verse 2] 
I trust in You I trust in You


[Verse 3] 
I believe, that You're my Healer I believe, that You are all I need I believe, that You're my portion I believe You're more than enough for me Jesus You're all I need


[Verse 4] 
Nothing is impossible for You Nothing is impossible for You Nothing is impossible for You You hold my world in Yours hands
