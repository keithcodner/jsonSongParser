[Verse 1] 
Lord I come to You Let my heart be changed renewed Flowing from the grace that I found in You


[Verse 2] 
Lord I've come to know The weaknesses I see in me Will be stripped away By the power of Your love


[Verse 3] 
Hold me close Let Your love surround me Bring me near Draw me to Your side


[Verse 4] 
And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle And I will soar with You Your Spirit leads me on By the power of Your love


[Verse 5] 
Lord unveil my eyes Let me see You face to face The knowledge of Your love As You live in me


[Verse 6] 
Lord renew my mind As Your will unfolds in my life In living every day By the power of Your love
