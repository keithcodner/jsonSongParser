[Verse 1] 
Our God is an Awesome God He reigns from heaven above With wisdom, power and love Our God is an Awesome God


[Verse 2] 
He reigns, He reigns He reigns, He reigns


[Verse 3] 
You're marvelous and You're Glorious Your love has made me victorious You took away the fear in us Now we can praise You 'cause You can deliver us There ain't no stopping us Devil, there ain't no blocking us Come on and clap your hands with us
