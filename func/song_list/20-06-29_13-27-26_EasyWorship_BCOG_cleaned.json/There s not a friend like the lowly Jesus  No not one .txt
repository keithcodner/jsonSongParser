[Verse 1] 
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus No, not one No, not one None else could heal all our soul's diseases No, not one No, not one


[Verse 2] 
Jesus knows all about our struggles He will guide till the day is done There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus No, not one No, not one


[Verse 3] 
No friend like Him is so high and holy No, not one No, not one And yet no friend is so meek and lowly No, not one No, not one


[Verse 4] 
There's not an hour that He is not near us No, not one No, not one No night so dark but His love can cheer us No, not one No, not one


[Verse 5] 
Did ever saint find this friend forsake him No, not one No, not one Or sinner find that he would not take him No, not one No, not one


[Verse 6] 
Was e'er a gift like the Saviour given No, not one No, not one Will He refulse us a home in heaven No, not one No, not one
