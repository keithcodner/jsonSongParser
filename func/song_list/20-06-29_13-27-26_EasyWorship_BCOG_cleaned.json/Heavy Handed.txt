[Verse 1] 
You won't leave me stranded Lord, You're heavy-handed When pouring out Your love on me Keep pouring out Your Love on me.


[Verse 2] 
When I call You race to my rescue When I fall You know just what to do.


[Verse 3] 
You won't leave me stranded Lord, You're heavy-handed When pouring out Your grace on me Keep pouring out Your grace on me.
