[Verse 1] 
If I had the wings like a dove If I had the wings like a dove I would fly, fly away, fly away And be at rest


[Verse 2] 
If I had the wings like a dove If I had the wings like a dove I would fly, fly away, fly away And be at rest


[Verse 3] 
Since I have no wings, since I have no wings Since I have no wings, I cannot fly, fly, fly Since I have no wings, since I have no wings Since I have no wings, I have to sing, sing, sing, sing


[Verse 4] 
If I had the wings like a dove If I had the wings like a dove I would fly, fly away, fly away And be at rest


[Verse 5] 
(..)


[Verse 6] 
Since I have no wings, since I have no wings Since I have no wings, I cannot fly, fly, fly Since I have no wings, since I have no wings Since I have no wings, I have to sing, sing, sing, sing


[Verse 7] 
If I had the wings like a dove If I had the wings like a dove I would fly, fly away, fly away And be at rest Fly away and be at rest
