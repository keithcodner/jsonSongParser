[Verse 1] 
Some glad morning when this life is over I'll fly away To a home on God's celestial shore I'll fly away


[Verse 2] 
I'll fly away O glory I'll fly away When I die, hallelujah by and by I'll fly away


[Verse 3] 
When the shadows of this life have grown I'll fly away Like a bird from prison bars has flown I'll fly away


[Verse 4] 
Just a few more weary days and then I'll fly away To a land where joys shall never end I'll fly away
