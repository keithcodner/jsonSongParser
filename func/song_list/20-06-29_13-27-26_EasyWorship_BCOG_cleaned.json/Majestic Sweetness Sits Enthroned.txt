[Verse 1] 
Majestic sweetness sits enthroned, Upon the Savior's brow; His head with radiant glories crowned, His lips with grace o'erflow, His lips with grace o'erflow.


[Verse 2] 
No mortal can with Him compare Among the sons of men; Fairer is He than all the fair Who fill the heav'nly train, Who fill the heav'nly train.


[Verse 3] 
He saw me plunged in deep distress, He flew to my relief; For me He bore the shameful Cross, And carried all my grief, And carried all my grief.


[Verse 4] 
To Him I owe my life and breath And all the joys I have; He makes me triumph over death, And saves me from the grave, And saves me from the grave.


[Verse 5] 
Since from His bounty I receive Such proofs of love divine, Had I a thousand hearts to give, Lord they should all be Thine; Lord they should all be Thine.
