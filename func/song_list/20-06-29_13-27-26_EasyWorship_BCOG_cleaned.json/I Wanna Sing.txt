[Verse 1] 
I wanna sing of Your mercy I wanna sing of Your love And tell the world I'm grateful For everything that You have done I wanna sing of Your kindness Wanna share the good news As long as I can sing I wanna sing about You


[Verse 2] 
Grace so amazing I can hardly understand How You forgive me And accept me as I am I can't believe the way You work in my life I would be crazy If I kept this all inside


[Verse 3] 
Hope for tomorrow And a passion for today Joy in the sorrow 'Cause You're with me all the way Oh and You gave Your life To show that You care This is the music That I want so much to share


[Verse 4] 
I want to make a difference Want to rise above the noise With the kind of words I choose to use Each time I lift my voice
