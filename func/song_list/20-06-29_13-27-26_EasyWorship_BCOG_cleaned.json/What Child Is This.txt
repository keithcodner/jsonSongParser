[Verse 1] 
This, this is Christ the King, Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. Haste, haste to bring Him laud, The Babe, the Son of Mary.


[Verse 2] 
What child is this who, Laid to rest, On Mary's lap is sleeping? Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, While shepherds watch are keeping.


[Verse 3] 
Why lies He in such mean estate Where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christian, fear; For sinners here The silent Word is pleading.


[Verse 4] 
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh; Come peasant, king to own Him. The King of kings salvation brings; Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
