[Verse 1] 
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus. There is room in my heart for Thee.


[Verse 2] 
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus, When Thou comest and callest for me.


[Verse 3] 
Thou didst leave Thy throne And Thy kingly crown, When Thou camest to earth for me. But in Bethlehem's home Was there found no room For Thy holy nativity.


[Verse 4] 
Heaven's arches rang, When the angels sang, Proclaiming Thy royal decree; But of lowly birth, Didst Thou come to earth And in great humility.


[Verse 5] 
The foxes found rest And the birds their nest, In the shade of the forest tree; But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God, In the deserts of Galilee.


[Verse 6] 
Thou camest, O Lord, With the living word, That should set Thy people free; But with mocking scorn And with crown of thorn, They bore Thee to Calvary.


[Verse 7] 
When the heaven's shall ring And the angels sing, At Thy coming to victory; Let Thy voice call me home, Saying, "Yet there is room, There is room at My side for thee."
