[Verse 1] 
The God of Abraham praise, Who reigns enthroned above; Ancient of everlasting days, And God of love. Jehovah, great I Am, By earth and heaven confessed; I bow and bless the sacred name, Forevermore blest.


[Verse 2] 
The God of Abraham praise, At whose supreme command; From earth I rise, And seek the joys At His right hand. I all on earth forsake, Its wisdom, fame, and power; And Him my only portion make, My shield and tower.


[Verse 3] 
He by Himself hath sworn, I on His oath depend; I shall on eagles wings upborne, To heaven ascend. I shall behold His face, I shall His power adore; And sing the wonders Of His grace forevermore.


[Verse 4] 
The whole triumphant host, Give thanks to God on high; "Hail, Father, Son and Holy Ghost!" They ever cry. Hail, Abraham's God and mine! I join the heavenly lays, All might and majesty are Thine; And endless praise. Amen.
