[Verse 1] 
I bring to You a fragrant offering I pour out my love and I wash Your feet I offer up to You, oh Lord, this brokenness What You see in me shall be my confidence


[Verse 2] 
May it be a pleasing Fragrance That I bring to You Oh Lord I am so in need of Your presence That I bow before You now


[Verse 3] 
I give to You a humble sacrifice I pour out my love and I give You my life I offer up to You, oh Lord, this costly gift And with absolute abandon my love I confess


[Verse 4] 
I pour my vial of worship over You
