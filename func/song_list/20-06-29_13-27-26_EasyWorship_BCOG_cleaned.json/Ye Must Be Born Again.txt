[Verse 1] 
"Ye must be born again; Ye must be born again. I verily, verily say unto thee, Ye must be born again."


[Verse 2] 
A ruler once came To Jesus by night To ask Him the way Of salvation and light. The Master made answer In words true and plain, "Ye must be born again."


[Verse 3] 
Ye children of men, Attend to the word So solemnly uttered By Jesus, the Lord; And let not this message To you be in vain, "Ye must be born again."


[Verse 4] 
O ye who would enter That glorious rest, And sing with the ransomed The song of the blest, The life everlasting If ye would obtain, "Ye must be born again."


[Verse 5] 
A dear one in heaven Thy heart yearns to see, At the beautiful gate May be watching for thee; Then list to the note Of this solemn refrain, "Ye must be born again."
