[Verse 1] 
Oh, how I love Jesus Oh, how I love Jesus Oh, how I love Jesus Because he first loved me


[Verse 2] 
There is a Name I love to hear, I love to sing its worth; It sounds like music in my ear, The sweetest Name on earth.


[Verse 3] 
Oh my Lord. It tells me of a Saviour's love, Who died to set me free; It tells me of His precious, precious blood, The sinner's perfect plea.
