[Verse 1] 
What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul! What wondrous love is this, O my soul! What wondrous love is this That caused the Lord of bliss To bear the dreadful curse For my soul, for my soul, To bear the dreadful curse for my soul!


[Verse 2] 
When I was sinking down, Sinking down, sinking down, When I was sinking down, sinking down; When I was sinking down Beneath God's righteous frown, Christ laid aside His crown For my soul, for my soul, Christ laid aside His crown for my soul!


[Verse 3] 
To God and to the Lamb, I will sing, I will sing, To God and to the Lamb, I will sing! To God and to the Lamb Who is the "Great I Am" While millions join the theme I will sing, I will sing, While millions join the theme I will sing!


[Verse 4] 
And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on, And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on! And when from death I'm free, I'll sing and joyful be And through eternity I'll sing on, I'll sing on And thro' eternity, I'll sing on!
