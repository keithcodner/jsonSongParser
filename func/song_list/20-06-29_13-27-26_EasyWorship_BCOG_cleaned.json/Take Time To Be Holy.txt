[Verse 1] 
Take time to be holy. Speak oft with thy Lord; Abide in Him always, And feed on His Word. Make friends with God's children; Help those who are weak, Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.


[Verse 2] 
Take time to be holy. The world rushes on; Spend much time in secret With Jesus alone. By looking to Jesus, Like Him thou shalt be; Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.


[Verse 3] 
Take time to be holy. Let Him be thy Guide; And run not before Him, Whatever betide. In joy or in sorrow, Still follow thy Lord, And, looking to Jesus, Still trust in His word.


[Verse 4] 
Take time to be holy, Be calm in thy soul; Each thought and each motive Beneath His control; Thus led by His Spirit To fountains of love, Thou soon shalt be fitted For service above.
