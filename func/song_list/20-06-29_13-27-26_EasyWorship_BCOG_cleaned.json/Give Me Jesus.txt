[Verse 1] 
O the height and depth of mercy! O the length and breadth of love! O the fullness of redemption, Pledge of endless life above!


[Verse 2] 
Take the world but give me Jesus. All its joys are but a name; But His love abideth ever, Through eternal years the same.


[Verse 3] 
Take the world but give me Jesus. Sweetest comfort of my soul; With my Savior watching o'er me, I can sing though billows roll.


[Verse 4] 
Take the world but give me Jesus. Let me view His constant smile; Then throughout my pilgrim journey Light will cheer me all the while.


[Verse 5] 
Take the world but give me Jesus. In His cross my trust shall be, Till with clearer brighter vision, Face to face my Lord I see.
