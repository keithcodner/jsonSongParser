[Verse 1] 
No one ever cared for me like Jesus There's no other friend so kind as He No one else could take the sin And darkness from me O how much He cared for me


[Verse 2] 
I would love to tell you What I think of Jesus Since I found in Him A friend so strong and true I would tell you how He changed my life completely He did something That no other friend could do


[Verse 3] 
All my life was full of sin When Jesus found me All my heart was full Of misery and woe Jesus placed His strong And loving arms around me And He led me in the way I ought to go


[Verse 4] 
Ev'ry day He comes to me With new assurance More and more I understand His words of love But I'll never know Just why He came to save me Till someday I see His blessed face above
