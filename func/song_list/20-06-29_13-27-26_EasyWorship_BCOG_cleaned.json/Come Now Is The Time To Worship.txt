[Verse 1] 
Come, now is the time to worship Come, now is the time to give your heart Come, just as you are to worship Come, just as you are before your God Come


[Verse 2] 
One day every tongue will confess You are Lord One day every knee will bow Still the greatest treasure remains for those Who gladly choose You now
