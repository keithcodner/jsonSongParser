[Verse 1] 
Please take from me my life When I don't have the strength To give it away to You Please take from me my life When I don't have the strength To give it away to You Jesus


[Verse 2] 
How many times Have I turned away The number is the same As the sand on the shore Every time You've taken me back And now I pray You'll do it once more


[Verse 3] 
How many times Have I gone astray The number is the same As the stars in the sky Every time You've taken me back And now I pray You'll do it tonight
