[Verse 1] 
Peace, Peace, wonderful peace, Coming down from the Father above. Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray, In fathomless billows of love.


[Verse 2] 
Far away in the depths Of my spirit tonight Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm; In celestial-like strains It unceasingly falls O'er my soul like an infinite calm.


[Verse 3] 
What a treasure I have In this wonderful peace, Buried deep in the heart of my soul, So secure that no power can mine it away While the years of eternity roll.


[Verse 4] 
I am resting tonight In this wonderful peace, Resting sweetly in Jesus' control. For I'm kept from all danger By night and by day, And His glory is flooding my soul.


[Verse 5] 
And me-thinks when I rise To that city of peace, Where the Author of peace I shall see, That one strain of the song Which the ransomed will sing In that heavenly kingdom shall be:


[Verse 6] 
Ah soul, are you here Without comfort or rest, Marching down the rough pathway of time? Make Jesus your friend Ere the shadows grow dark. Oh accept this sweet peace so sublime.
