[Verse 1] 
There's a song in my heart And it's dedicated to You alone It's my gift of worship And I'm laying it down at Your throne


[Verse 2] 
Let this gift be pleasing to You Let my praise be sweet to You


[Verse 3] 
It's all for You Jesus, it's all for You My worship and my love Is for You


[Verse 4] 
My worship and my love Is for You
