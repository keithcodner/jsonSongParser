[Verse 1] 
Oh Lord my God When I in awesome wonder Consider all the works thy hands hath made I see the stars And I hear the rolling thunder Thy power throughout the universe displayed


[Verse 2] 
Then sings my soul My Saviour God to thee How great Thou art How great Thou art


[Verse 3] 
And when I think that God His son not sparing Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in That on the cross my burden gladly bearing He bled and died to take away my sin


[Verse 4] 
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation And take me home what joy shall fill my heart Then I shall bow in humble adoration And there proclaim my God how great Thou art
