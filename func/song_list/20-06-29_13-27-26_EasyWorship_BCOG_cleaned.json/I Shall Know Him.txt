[Verse 1] 
When my life's work is ended And I cross the swelling tide When the bright and glorious morning I shall see I shall know my redeemer when I reach the other side And His smile will be the first to welcome me


[Verse 2] 
I shall know Him I shall know Him As redeemed by His side I shall stand I shall know Him I shall know Him By the print of the nails in His hand


[Verse 3] 
The soul thrilling rapture When I view His blessed face And the lustre of this kindly beaming eye How my full heart will prasie Him For the mercy love and grace That prepares me for a mansion in the sky


[Verse 4] 
Thro' the gates to the city In a robe of spotless white He will lead me where No tears will ever fall In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight But I long to meet my saviour first of all
