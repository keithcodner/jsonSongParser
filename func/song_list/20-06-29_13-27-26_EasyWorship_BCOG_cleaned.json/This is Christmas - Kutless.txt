[Verse 1] 
Do you find it hard to sleep tonight Resting by the Christmas lights Could there be something you forgot


[Verse 2] 
Beyond the bows and mistletoe The tree with presents wrapped below There's more to this than you had ever thought


[Verse 3] 
Have we lost the reason that We celebrate each year


[Verse 4] 
What is Christmas If there never was a savior Wrapped in a manger What is Christmas without Christ


[Verse 5] 
Remember how the story goes God's gift was wrapped in swaddling clothes Beneath the star, one great and holy night


[Verse 6] 
The shepherds heard the angels sing The wise man brought an offering Peace on Earth began in Bethlehem Pre-Chorus] Have we lost the reason that We celebrate each year


[Verse 7] 
What is Christmas If there never was a savior Wrapped in a manger What is Christmas If the angels never sang Glory to the newborn king What is Christmas without Christ


[Verse 8] 
There'd be no Gloria In excelsis deo Gloria In excelsis deo


[Verse 9] 
What is Christmas (Joy to the world) If there never was a savior Wrapped in a manger (Joy to the world) What is Christmas without Christ


[Verse 10] 
This is Christmas It's all about a savior Wrapped in a manger (Joy to the world) This is Christmas Because of Jesus Christ


[Verse 11] 
(Gloria) This is Christmas (In excelsis deo) Because of Christ (In excelsis deo) Because of Christ
