[Verse 1] 
There's a sweet sweet spirit in this place And I know it's the spirit of the Lord


[Verse 2] 
Sweet Holy Spirit Sweet Heavenly Dove Stay right here with us Filling us with Your love And for each blessing


[Verse 3] 
We lift out hearts in praise Without a doubt we know That we have been revived When we shall leave this place
