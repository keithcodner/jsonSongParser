[Verse 1] 
I will fight for you I will fight for you By the power of My Spirit says the Lord I will fight for you I will see you through By the power of My Spirit says the Lord


[Verse 2] 
In the days of the battle you'll be fearless And in the midst of the strom you will prevail As we lift the Mighty Name of Jesus Know my church that you will never fail
