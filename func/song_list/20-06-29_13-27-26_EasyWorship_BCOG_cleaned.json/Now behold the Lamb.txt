[Verse 1] 
Now behold the Lamb The Precious Lamb of God Born into sin that I may live again The Precious Lamb of God


[Verse 2] 
Holy is the Lamb The Precious Lamb of God Why You love me so, Lord I shall never know The Precious Lamb of God


[Verse 3] 
Now behold the Lamb The Precious Lamb of God Born into sin that I may live again The Precious Lamb of God


[Verse 4] 
When I always didn't do right I went left, He told me to right But I'm standing right here in the midst of my tears I claim You to be the Lamb of God


[Verse 5] 
Thank You for the Lamb The Precious Lamb of God Because of Your grace I can finish this race The Precious Lamb of God


[Verse 6] 
Even when I broke Your heart My sins tore us apart But I'm standing right here in the midst of my tears I claim You to be the Lamb of God


[Verse 7] 
Now behold the Lamb The Precious Lamb of God Born into sin that I may live again The Precious Lamb of God


[Verse 8] 
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh


[Verse 9] 
Why You love me so, Lord I shall never know Why You love me so, Lord I shall never know Why You love me so, Lord I shall never know The Precious Lamb of God
