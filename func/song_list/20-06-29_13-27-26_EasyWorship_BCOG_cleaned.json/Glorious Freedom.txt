[Verse 1] 
Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom, No more in chains of sin I repine! Jesus the glorious emancipator, Now and forever He shall be mine.


[Verse 2] 
Once I was bound by sin's galling fetters, Chained like a slave I struggled in vain, But I received a glorious freedom, When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.


[Verse 3] 
Freedom from all the carnal affections, Freedom from envy, hatred and strife. Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions, Freedom from all that saddened my life.


[Verse 4] 
Freedom from pride and all sinful follies, Freedom from love and glitter of gold. Freedom from evil, temper, and anger, Glorious freedom, rapture untold.


[Verse 5] 
Freedom from fear with all of its torments, Freedom from care with all of its pain. Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer, He who has rent my fetters in twain.
