[Verse 1] 
Light of the world You stepped down into darkness Opened my eyes let me see Beauty that made this heart adore You Hope of a life spent with You


[Verse 2] 
Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that You're my God You're all together lovely All together worthy All together wonderful to me


[Verse 3] 
King of all days Oh so highly exalted Glorious in heaven above Humbly You came To the earth You created All for loves sake became poor


[Verse 4] 
Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that You're my God You're all together lovely All together worthy All together wonderful to me


[Verse 5] 
And I'll never know How much it cost To see my sin upon the cross


[Verse 6] 
Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that You're my God You're all together lovely All together worthy All together wonderful to me
