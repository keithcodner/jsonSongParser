[Verse 1] 
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord All ye lands, All ye lands


[Verse 2] 
Sing forth honour of His name Make His praise glorious


[Verse 3] 
O taste and see That the Lord is good We went through the fire And through the water too


[Verse 4] 
The devil tried to defeat us But we've come out victorious


[Verse 5] 
Into a wealthy place
