[Verse 1] 
Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul Like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart.


[Verse 2] 
What a wonderful change In my life has been wrought Since Jesus came into my heart! I have light in my soul, For which long I have sought, Since Jesus came into my heart.


[Verse 3] 
I have ceased from my Wandering and going astray Since Jesus came into my heart; And my sins which were many Are all washed away, Since Jesus came into my heart.


[Verse 4] 
There's a light in the Valley of death now for me, Since Jesus came into my heart; And the gates of the city Beyond I can see, Since Jesus came into my heart.


[Verse 5] 
I shall go there to dwell In that city I know, Since Jesus came into my heart; And I'm happy, so happy, As onward I go, Since Jesus came into my heart.


[Verse 6] 
I'm possessed of a hope That is steadfast and sure, Since Jesus came into my heart; And no dark clouds of doubt Now my pathway obscure, Since Jesus came into my heart.
