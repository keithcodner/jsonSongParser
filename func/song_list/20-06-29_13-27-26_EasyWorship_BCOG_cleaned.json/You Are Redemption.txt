[Verse 1] 
You are, You are You are, You are You are, You are You are, You are You are, You are redemption


[Verse 2] 
You are You are You are You are You are You are redemption


[Verse 3] 
You are the King inviting the pauper To come unafraid to the throne You are the Father watching and waiting To welcome the prodigal home


[Verse 4] 
You are the Healer embracing the broken For all who are wounded and weak You are strong This is Your story This is Your song


[Verse 5] 
You are redemption reckless abandon Extravagant mercy and grace unrestrained Incredible freedom without condition passionate Infinite love untamed You are redemption


[Verse 6] 
You are the Judge taking the place Of the prisoner sentenced to die You are the Warrior riding to battle Declaring His love for His bride


[Verse 7] 
You are the Hero arriving in glory To rescue the captive when all hope is gone This is Your story This is Your song


[Verse 8] 
You are redemption reckless abandon Extravagant mercy and grace unrestrained Incredible freedom without condition Passionate infinite love untamed You are redemption
