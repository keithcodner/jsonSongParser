[Verse 1] 
Jesus, You're the center of my joy All that's good and perfect comes from You You're the heart of my contentment Hope for all I do Jesus, You're the center of my joy


[Verse 2] 
When I've lost my direction You're the compass for my way You're the fire and light When nights are long and cold In sadness, You're my laughter That shatters all my fears When I'm all alone, Your hand is there to hold


[Verse 3] 
You are why I find pleasure In the simple things in life You're the music in the meadows and the streams The voices of the children, my family, and my home You're the source and finish of my highest dreams


[Verse 4] 
Jesus You're The Center of My Joy (repeat)
