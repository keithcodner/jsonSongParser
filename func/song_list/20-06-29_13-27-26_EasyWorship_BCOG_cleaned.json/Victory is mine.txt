[Verse 1] 
Victory is mine, Victory is mine, Victory today is mine


[Verse 2] 
I told Satan get thee behind, Victory today is mine


[Verse 3] 
When I rose this morning, I didn't have no doubt, I knew that the Lord would bring me out


[Verse 4] 
I fell on my knees, Said, "Lord help me please" Got up singing and shouting the victory


[Verse 5] 
Joy is mine, Joy is mine, Joy today is mine


[Verse 6] 
I told Satan get thee behind, Joy today is mine


[Verse 7] 
Happiness is mine, Happiness is mine, Happiness today is mine


[Verse 8] 
I told Satan get thee behind, Happiness is mine
