[Verse 1] 
I cry out for Your hand of mercy to heal me I am weak and I need Your love to free me Oh Lord, my Rock, my Strength in weakness Come rescue me, Oh Lord


[Verse 2] 
You are my hope, Your promise never fails me And my desire is to follow You forever


[Verse 3] 
For You are good For You are good For You are good to me
