[Verse 1] 
I love Your name, And I love Your touch I love Your voice, How it heals my heart Oh Lord, Oh Lord I'm so in love with You


[Verse 2] 
I love Your thoughts, And I love Your ways I love Your word, Love to give You praise Oh Lord, oh Lord, I'm so in love with You


[Verse 3] 
Oh Lamb, Oh Lamb, My sins held You to, to the cross Oh Lamb, oh Lamb Your love paid the price for us all


[Verse 4] 
Oh Lamb, oh Lamb, Your love covers all, all my faults Oh Lamb, oh lamb, My heart longs for all that You are


[Verse 5] 
With a heart of love And a sincere praise My true desire is You, oh Lord With this song of worship Hands upraised that say


[Verse 6] 
We love You We love You We love You We love You
