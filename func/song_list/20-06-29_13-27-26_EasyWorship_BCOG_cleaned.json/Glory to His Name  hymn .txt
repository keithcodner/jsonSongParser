[Verse 1] 
Down at the cross where my Saviour died, Down where for cleansing from sin I cried, There to my heart was the blood applied; Glory to His Name!


[Verse 2] 
Glory to His Name, Glory to His Name! There to my heart was the blood applied Glory to His Name!


[Verse 3] 
I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within, There at the cross where He took me in Glory to His Name!


[Verse 4] 
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin, I am so glad I have entered in; There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean Glory to His Name!


[Verse 5] 
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet, Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet, Plunge in today, and be made complete Glory to His Name!
