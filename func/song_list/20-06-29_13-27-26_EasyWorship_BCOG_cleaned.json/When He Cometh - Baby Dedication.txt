[Verse 1] 
When He cometh When He cometh To make up His jewels All the jewels Precious jewels His loved and His own


[Verse 2] 
Like the stars of the morning His bright crown adorning They shall shine in their beauty Bright gems for His crown


[Verse 3] 
Little children Little children Who love their redeemer Are the jewels Precious jewels His loved and His own
