[Verse 1] 
We praise Thee, O God, Our Redeemer, Creator In grateful devotion Our tribute we bring; We lay it before Thee, We kneel and adore Thee, We bless Thy holy name, Glad praises we sing.


[Verse 2] 
We worship Thee, God of our fathers, We bless Thee Thru life's storm and tempest, Our guide has Thou been; When perils o'er take us, Escape Thou wilt make us, And with Thy help, O Lord, Our battles we win.


[Verse 3] 
With voices united Our praises we offer To Thee, great Jehovah, Glad anthems we raise; Thy strong arm will guide us, Our God is beside us, To Thee, our great Redeemer, Forever be praise!
