[Verse 1] 
There is Power in the Name of Jesus There is Power in the Name of Jesus There is Power in the Name of Jesus


[Verse 2] 
To Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain


[Verse 3] 
There's an army rising up There's an army rising up There's an army rising up


[Verse 4] 
Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain


[Verse 5] 
I hear the chains falling I hear the chains falling I hear the chains falling


[Verse 6] 
All Sufficient Sacrifice So Freely Given Such a Price You Bought Our Redemption Heaven's Gates Swing Wide
