[Verse 1] 
Oh precious is the flow That makes me white as snow No other fount I know Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 2] 
What can wash away my sin Nothing but the blood of Jesus What can make me whole again Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 3] 
Oh precious is the flow That makes me white as snow No other fount I know Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 4] 
For my pardon, this I see Nothing but the blood of Jesus For my cleansing, this my plea Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 5] 
Oh precious is the flow That makes me white as snow No other fount I know Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 6] 
Nothing can for sin atone Nothing but the blood of Jesus Naught of good that I have done Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 7] 
Oh precious is the flow That makes me white as snow No other fount I know Nothing but the blood of Jesus


[Verse 8] 
This is all my hope and peace Nothing but the blood of Jesus This is all my righteousness Nothing but the blood of Jesus
