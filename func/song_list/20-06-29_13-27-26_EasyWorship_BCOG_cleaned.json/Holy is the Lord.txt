[Verse 1] 
We stand and lift up our hands For the joy of the Lord is our strength We bow down and worship him now How great, how awesome is He


[Verse 2] 
Holy is the Lord God Almighty The earth is filled with his glory Holy is the Lord God Almighty The earth is filled with his glory The earth is filled with his glory


[Verse 3] 
We stand and lift up our hands For the joy of the Lord is our strength We bow down and worship him now How great, how awesome is He


[Verse 4] 
Holy is the Lord God Almighty The earth is filled with his glory Holy is the Lord God Almighty The earth is filled with his glory The earth is filled with his glory


[Verse 5] 
It's rising up all around It's the anthem of the Lord's renown


[Verse 6] 
It's rising up all around
