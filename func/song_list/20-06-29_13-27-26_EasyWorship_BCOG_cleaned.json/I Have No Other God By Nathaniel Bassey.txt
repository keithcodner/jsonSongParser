[Verse 1] 
I have no other God But you


[Verse 2] 
You have done what no man has done you will do What no man can do


[Verse 3] 
I may not know what you are going Through today Your sorrow, the hardship, the pain For though the mountains scrubbed The oceans raged And war against my soul


[Verse 4] 
The devil may waged Though the tempest has turned my smiles Upside down And my life, like a river of sorrow In which i drawn Yet will i stand


[Verse 5] 
Unshaken for as long as it last Faithful is He that promised And it shall come to pass If God be for us Then who can stand against The God who spoke all the earth is deformed
