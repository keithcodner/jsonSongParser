[Verse 1] 
Welcome to Bramalea Where the word of God is preached Where His power is released and lives are changed Cause at Bramalea we're glad to see you Cause without you it just wouldn't be the same


[Verse 2] 
We're glad you came It's a pleasure to see your face Stay awhile It's a blessing to see your smile


[Verse 3] 
This is your day to receive So just trust and believe Cause at Bramalea you'll never leave the same


[Verse 4] 
We're blessed in the city We're blessed in the field We're blessed when we come and when we go


[Verse 5] 
We cast down every stronghold Sickness and poverty must cease For the devil is the defeated We are blessed


[Verse 6] 
Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around He's gonna work in your favour Yeah


[Verse 7] 
Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around And around and around and around


[Verse 8] 
Yes I believe it Yes I believe it Yes I believe it


[Verse 9] 
Yes I receive it Yes I receive it Yes I receive it


[Verse 10] 
Say Ya, ya, ya
