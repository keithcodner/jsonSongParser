[Verse 1] 
The Lord is Blessing me right now I can feel His Spirit coming down You may not be able to see What the Lord has done for me But the Lord is Blessing me right now


[Verse 2] 
I see the Blessing I see the Blessing I see the Blessing


[Verse 3] 
Showers of Blessing Showers of Blessing It's coming down It's coming down It's coming down
