[Verse 1] 
We're blessed in the city We're blessed in the field We're blessed when we come and when we go


[Verse 2] 
We cast down every stronghold Sickness and poverty must cease For the devil is the defeated We are blessed


[Verse 3] 
Since thou has walked uprightly As a light in the dark land Since thou has place in thine heart All the Lord's commands He's set thee above nations And cast thine enemies away He's standing up within you So let me hear you say


[Verse 4] 
Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around He's gonna work in your favour Yeah


[Verse 5] 
Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around And around and around and around


[Verse 6] 
Yes I believe it Yes I receive it Yes I believe it


[Verse 7] 
Yes I receive it Yes I receive it Yes I receive it
