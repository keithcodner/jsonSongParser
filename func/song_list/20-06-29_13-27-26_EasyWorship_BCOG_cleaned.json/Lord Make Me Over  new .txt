[Verse 1] 
You know my other side I can no longer hide Let you down so many times Sin freshly crucifies


[Verse 2] 
Thought I had a plan I had it all figured out But the more that you tried To be by my side The more I pushed you out


[Verse 3] 
Lord, make me over Lord, make me over Lord, make me over Make me over again


[Verse 4] 
Time after time I've failed you Pierced your side but they already nailed you Jesus heal my open wounds I just want to be more like you


[Verse 5] 
Father I let you down What's not like you just take it out Reconcile me Jesus I just want to please you Wash me and make me whole


[Verse 6] 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Make me over again
