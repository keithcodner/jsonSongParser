[Verse 1] 
We will glorify the King of kings We will glorify the Lamb We will glorify the Lord of lords Who is the great I Am


[Verse 2] 
Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty We will bow before His throne We will worship Him in righteousness We will worship Him alone


[Verse 3] 
He is Lord of heaven Lord of earth He is Lord of all who live He is Lord above the universe All praise to Him we give


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah to the King of kings Hallelujah to the Lamb Hallelujah to the Lord of lords Who is the great I Am
