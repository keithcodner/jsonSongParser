[Verse 1] 
God will take care of you. Thro' every day, o'er all the way, He will take care of you; God will take care of you.


[Verse 2] 
Be not dismayed whate'er betide, God will take care of you; Beneath His wings of love abide, God will take care of you.


[Verse 3] 
Thro' days of toil, When heart doth fail, God will take care of you; When dangers fierce your path assail, God will take care of you.


[Verse 4] 
All you may need He will provide, God will take care of you; Nothing you ask will be denied, God will take care of you.


[Verse 5] 
No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you; Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you.
