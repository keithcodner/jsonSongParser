[Verse 1] 
I'll just say yes You lead the way I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say


[Verse 2] 
This life you gave is not my own I'm trusting you to hear my yes and lead me on


[Verse 3] 
Yes Lord, yes Lord My life is yours Yes Lord, yes Lord My life is yours


[Verse 4] 
And there is peace when I say yes I might not see it now But you save the best For all who trust you and obey There is an answer, no more delay
