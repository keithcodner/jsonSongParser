[Verse 1] 
I'm forgiven because you were forsaken I'm accepted You were condemned I'm alive and well Your Spirit lives within me Because you died and rose again


[Verse 2] 
Amazing Love how can it be That you my King would die for me Amazing Love I know it's true And it's my joy to honour you in all I do


[Verse 3] 
You are my King, Jesus You are my King You are my King, Jesus You are my King
