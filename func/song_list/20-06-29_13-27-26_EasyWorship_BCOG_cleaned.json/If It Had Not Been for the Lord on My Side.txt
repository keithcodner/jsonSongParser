[Verse 1] 
If it had not been for the Lord on my side Tell me where would I be Where would I be


[Verse 2] 
He kept my enemies away He made the sun shine through a cloudy day He wrapped me in the cradle of His arms Because He knew I was battered and scorned


[Verse 3] 
He never left me all alone He gave me peace and joy I've never known He answered when I knelt to him in prayer And in victory the Lord brought me this way
