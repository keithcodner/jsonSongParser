[Verse 1] 
Lift him up, lift him up Lift the name of Jesus higher Lift him up, raise his banner to the sky He said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me Lift him up, all ye people, lift him up


[Verse 2] 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord Praise his righteousness forever Praise the Lord, raise your voices to the sky He said if you won't praise my name Then the rocks & stones will cry out Lift him up, all ye people, lift him up


[Verse 3] 
Show his love, show his love Show his love to everybody Show his love, raise your banner to the sky He said that by the love we show They will know we're his Disciples Show his love, all ye people, show his love
