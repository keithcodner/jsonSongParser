[Verse 1] 
O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining It is the night of our dear Savior's birth


[Verse 2] 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth


[Verse 3] 
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn


[Verse 4] 
Fall on your knees O hear the angel voices O night divine! O night when Christ was born O night divine! O night, o night divine!


[Verse 5] 
And in His Name, all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we Let all within us praise his holy name Christ is the Lord! Their name forever praise we


[Verse 6] 
Noel, Noel O night, o night Divine Noel, Noel O night, o night Divine Noel, Noel O night, o holy Divine
