[Verse 1] 
The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide A shelter in the time of storm Secure whatever i'll betide A shelter in the time of storm


[Verse 2] 
O, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land A weary land, a weary land O, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land A weary land, a weary land


[Verse 3] 
O Rock divine O refuge dear A shelter in the time of storm Be thou our helper ever near A weary land, a weary land
