[Verse 1] 
Glory! Glory! How the angels sing! Glory! Glory! How the loud harps ring! 'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea, Pealing forth the anthem of the free.


[Verse 2] 
Ring the bells of heaven! There is joy today, For a soul returning from the wild! See the Father meets Him out upon the way, Welcoming His weary wand'ring child.


[Verse 3] 
Ring the bells of heaven! There is joy today, For the wand'rer now is reconciled. Yes a soul is rescued from His sinful way, And is born anew a ransomed child.


[Verse 4] 
Ring the bells of heaven! Spread the feast today! Angels swell the glad triumphant strain! Tell the joyful tidings; Bear it far away! For a precious soul is born again.
