[Verse 1] 
O love that will not let me go, I rest my weary soul in Thee. I give Thee back the life I owe, That in Thine ocean depths its flow, May richer fuller be.


[Verse 2] 
O light that foll'west all my way, I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee. My heart restores its borrowed ray, That in Thy sunshine's blaze it's day, May brighter fairer be.


[Verse 3] 
O joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to Thee. I trace the rainbow through the rain, And feel the promise is not vain, That morn shall tearless be.


[Verse 4] 
O cross that lifted up my head, I dare not ask to fly from Thee. I lay in dust life's glory dead, And from the ground there blossoms red, Life that shall endless be.
