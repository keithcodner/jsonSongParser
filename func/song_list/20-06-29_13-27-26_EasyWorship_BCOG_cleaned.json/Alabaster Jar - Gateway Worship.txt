[Verse 1] 
This alabaster jar is all I have of worth I break it at Your feet, Lord it's less than You deserve You're far more beautiful, more precious than oil The sum of my desires and the fullness of my joy Like You spilled Your blood, I spill my heart As an offering to my King


[Verse 2] 
Here I am, take me as an offering Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory Take me


[Verse 3] 
This time that I have left is all I have worth I lay it at Your feet, Lord, it's less than You deserve And though I've little strength, and though my days are few You gave Your life for me so I will live my life for You


[Verse 4] 
Like You spilled Your blood, I spill my heart As an offering to my King


[Verse 5] 
Here I am, take me as an offering Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory Here I am, take me as an offering Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory, take me


[Verse 6] 
Worthy, worthy, You are worthy, worthy is the Lord Worthy, worthy, You are worthy, worthy is the Lord


[Verse 7] 
Here I am, take me as an offering Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory Here I am, take me as an offering Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory, Take me
