[Verse 1] 
Open my eyes that I may see Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me; Place in my hands the wonderful key That shall unclasp and set me free. Silently now I wait for Thee, Ready my God Thy will to see. Open my eyes. Illumine me, Spirit divine!


[Verse 2] 
Open my ears that I may hear Voices of truth Thou sendest clear; And while the wave-notes fall on my ear, Everything false will disappear. Silently now I wait for Thee, Ready my God Thy will to see. Open my ears, Illumine me, Spirit divine!


[Verse 3] 
Open my mouth and let me bear Gladly the warm truth everywhere. Open my heart and let me prepare Love with Thy children thus to share. Silently now I wait for Thee, Ready my God Thy will to see. Open my heart. Illumine me, Spirit divine!


[Verse 4] 
Open my mind that I may read More of Thy love in word and deed. What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead? Only for light from Thee I plead. Silently now I wait for Thee, Ready, my God, Thy will to see. Open my mind. Illumine me, Spirit divine!
