[Verse 1] 
I need You To soften my heart and break me apart I need You To open my eyes, to see that You're shaping my life All I am, I surrender


[Verse 2] 
Give me faith to trust what You say, That You're good and Your love is great I'm broken inside, I give You my life


[Verse 3] 
I need You To soften my heart and break me apart I need You To pierce through the dark and cleanse every part of me All I am, I surrender


[Verse 4] 
And I may be weak but Your Spirit's strong in me My flesh may fail, but my God, You never will
