[Verse 1] 
You are worthy of all honor Glory praise and power King of the nations You are holy God almighty Clothed in brilliant majesty Father Spirit Jesus


[Verse 2] 
Lord the worship we bring Is more than songs that we sing It's a reflection of our ever changing lives The best we have to offer We don't just lift up our hands Lord we lift up our lives For we know that You are worthy of our praise To You our lifesongs raise


[Verse 3] 
Rescued from darkness We are walkin' in marvelous light For we are children of the King Sing
