[Verse 1] 
Peace of God Cover me Cover me Cover me Peace of God cover me Through the storm cover me


[Verse 2] 
Only in You I am safe Only in You I'm secure Only in You I find peace So cover me Cover me


[Verse 3] 
Cover me when I am hurting Cover me when I'm not strong Cover me when I am going through the storm


[Verse 4] 
Cover me when all seems hopeless Cover me when my faith is gone Let the Peace that passes all I understand Cover me Cover me
