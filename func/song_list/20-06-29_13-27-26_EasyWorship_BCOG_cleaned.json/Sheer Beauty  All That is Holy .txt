[Verse 1] 
Here in your presence I fall to my knees I’m overcome I’m overcome I am defeated You conquer me With your love With your love


[Verse 2] 
I raise my hands in surrender You have captured my heart


[Verse 3] 
You are sheer beauty Absolute glory Consummate mercy Incomparable grace Infinite power Unchanging wonder Everything worthy Of undying praise All that is holy All that is holy All that is holy You are sheer beauty


[Verse 4] 
Here in your presence You speak my name I come undone I come undone All of my worship and All of my praise Is not enough Is not enough


[Verse 5] 
I raise my hands in surrender You have captured my heart
