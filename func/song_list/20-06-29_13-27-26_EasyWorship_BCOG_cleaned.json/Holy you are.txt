[Verse 1] 
We join with the angels' adoration We bow casting down our golden crowns and We call to the Father God Almighty We cry holy, holy, holy


[Verse 2] 
Holy, you are holy Holy, you are holy Holy, you are holy Oh Lord, yes you are Holy


[Verse 3] 
Holy is the one who was and is and is to come


[Verse 4] 
Holy is the one who was and is and is to come Again
