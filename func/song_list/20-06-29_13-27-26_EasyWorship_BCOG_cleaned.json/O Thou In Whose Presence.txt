[Verse 1] 
O Thou in whose presence My soul takes delight, On Whom in affliction I call My Comfort by day And my Song in the night, My Hope, my Salvation, my All!


[Verse 2] 
Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd, Resort with Thy sheep. To feed them in pastures of love? Say, why in the valley, Of death should I weep, Or alone in this wilderness rove?


[Verse 3] 
O, why should I wander, An alien from Thee, Or cry in the desert For bread? Thy foes will rejoice, When my sorrows they see, And smile at the tears, I have shed.


[Verse 4] 
Ye daughters of Zion declare, Have you seen the star, That on Israel shone. Say if in your tents, My beloved has been, And where with His flocks He is gone.


[Verse 5] 
He looks! And ten thousands Of angels rejoice, And myriads wait for His word. He speaks! And eternity, Filled with His voice, Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.


[Verse 6] 
Dear Shepherd! I hear, And will follow Thy call; I know the sweet sound of Thy voice. Restore and defend me, For Thou art my all, And in Thee I will ever rejoice.
