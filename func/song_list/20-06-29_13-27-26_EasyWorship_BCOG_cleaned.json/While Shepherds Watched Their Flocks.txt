[Verse 1] 
While shepherds watched their flocks by night, All seated on the ground, The angel of the Lord came down, And glory shone around.


[Verse 2] 
"Be not afraid," the angel said, For fear had seized their mind; "Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind.


[Verse 3] 
"To you, in David's town town this day Is born of David's line A Savior, who is Christ the Lord; And this shall be the sign:


[Verse 4] 
"The heavenly Babe you there shall find To human view displayed, In simple clothing, tightly wrapped, And in a manger laid."


[Verse 5] 
Thus spoke the seraph, and at once Appeared a shining throng Of angels praising God, who thus Addressed their joyful song:


[Verse 6] 
"All glory be to God on high And on the earth be peace; Good will hence forth from heaven to men Begin and never cease."
