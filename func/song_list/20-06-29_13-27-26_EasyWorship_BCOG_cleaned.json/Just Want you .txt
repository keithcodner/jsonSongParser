[Verse 1] 
There's a name above all others, Wonderful to hear, bringing hope and cheer. It's the lovely name of Jesus, Evermore the same, what a lovely name.


[Verse 2] 
What a lovely name, the name of Jesus. Reaching higher far, than the brightest star. Sweeter than the songs they sing in heaven. Let the world proclaim, what a lovely name.


[Verse 3] 
Thru His name there's wondrous power, Power to redeem, making sinners clean. By His pow'r He cleansed the leper, Opened blinded eyes, caused the dead to rise.


[Verse 4] 
He'll return in clouds of glory, Saints of ev'ry race, shall behold His face. With Him enter heaven's city, Ever to proclaim, what a lovely name.
