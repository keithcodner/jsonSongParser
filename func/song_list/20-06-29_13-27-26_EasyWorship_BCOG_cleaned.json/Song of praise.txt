[Verse 1] 
My heart will sing a song of praise Unto my Savior For all He is and all He’s done And brought me through


[Verse 2] 
My voice will shout and glorify The name of Jesus A song of praise, till end of days I’ll worship You


[Verse 3] 
A song of praise that I will sing Throughout the ages A song of praise To fill the heaven and the earth


[Verse 4] 
I lift my hands and raise my voice With all creation To sing to You, O precious Lord A song of praise


[Verse 5] 
Just as the rain falls to the ground And brings refreshing Your word goes forth To do Your will and give us life


[Verse 6] 
The mountains sing a song to You With all creation A song of praise, till end of days To worship You
