[Verse 1] 
I'm pressing on the upward way New heights I'm gaining every day Still praying as I'm onward bound Lord, plant my feet on higher ground


[Verse 2] 
Lord lift me up and let me stand By faith on heaven stable am A higher plane than I have found Lord, plant my feet on higher ground


[Verse 3] 
My heart has no desire to stay Where doubts arise and fears dismay Tho' some may dwell where these abound My prayer, my aim is higher ground


[Verse 4] 
I want to live above the world Tho' satan's darts at me are hurled For faith has caught the joyful sound The song of saints on higher ground


[Verse 5] 
I want to scale the utmost height And catch a gleam of glory bright But still I'll pray till heaven I've found Lord, lead me on to higher ground
