[Verse 1] 
Wonderful Savior, wonderful Savior, Thou art so near, so precious to me! Wonderful Savior, wonderful Savior My heart is filled with praises to Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, my King, my wonderful Savior, All of my life is given to Thee. I am rejoicing in Thy salvation. Thy precious blood now maketh me free.


[Verse 3] 
Freedom from sin, O wonderful story! All of its stains washed whiter than snow! Jesus has come to live in His temple, And with His love my heart is aglow.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, my Lord, I'll ever adore Thee, Lay at Thy feet my treasures of love. Lead me in ways to show forth Thy glory, Ways that will end in heaven above.


[Verse 5] 
When in that bright and beautiful city I shall behold Thy glories untold, I shall be like Thee, wonderful Savior, And I will sing while ages unfold.
