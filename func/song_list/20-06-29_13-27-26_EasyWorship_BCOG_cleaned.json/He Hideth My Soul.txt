[Verse 1] 
He hideth my soul In the cleft of the rock That shadows a dry, thirsty land. He hideth my life In the depths of His love. And covers me there with His hand. And covers me there with His hand.


[Verse 2] 
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, A wonderful Savior to me. He hideth my soul In the cleft of the rock, Where rivers of pleasure I see.


[Verse 3] 
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord. He taketh my burden away. He holdeth me up And I shall not be moved. He giveth me strength as my day.


[Verse 4] 
With numberless blessings Each moment He crowns; And filled with His fullness divine, I sing in my rapture, "Oh, glory to God For such a Redeemer as mine!"


[Verse 5] 
When clothed in His brightness Transported I rise, To meet Him in clouds of the sky, His perfect salvation, His wonderful love I'll shout With the millions on high.
