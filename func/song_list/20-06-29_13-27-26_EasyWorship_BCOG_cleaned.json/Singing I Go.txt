[Verse 1] 
Singing I go along life's road, Praising the Lord, praising the Lord; Singing I go along life's road, For Jesus has lifted my load.


[Verse 2] 
The trusting heart to Jesus clings, Nor any ill forebodes, But at the cross of Calvary sings, "Praise God for lifted loads!"


[Verse 3] 
The passing days bring many cares. "Fear not," I hear Him say; And when my fears are turned to prayers, The burdens slip away.


[Verse 4] 
He tells me of my Father's love, And never slumbering eye; My everlasting King above Will all my needs supply.


[Verse 5] 
When to the throne of grace I flee, I find the promise true; The mighty arms upholding me Will bear my burdens too.
