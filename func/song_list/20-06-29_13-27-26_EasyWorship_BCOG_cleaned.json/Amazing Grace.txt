[Verse 1] 
Amazing grace how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me; I once was lost, but now am found Was blind, but now I see.


[Verse 2] 
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved; How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed.


[Verse 3] 
Through many dangers, toil and snares, I have already come; 'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.


[Verse 4] 
When we've been there ten thousand years Bright shining as the sun, We've no less days to sing God's praise Than when we've first begun.
