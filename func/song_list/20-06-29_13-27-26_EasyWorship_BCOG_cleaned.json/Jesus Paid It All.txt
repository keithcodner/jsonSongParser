[Verse 1] 
I hear the Savior say The strength indeed is small Child of weakness, watch and pray Find in Me thine all in all


[Verse 2] 
Jesus paid it all All to him I owe Sin had left a crimson stain He washed it white as snow


[Verse 3] 
Lord, now indeed I find Thy pow'r and thine alone Can change the leper's spots And melt the heart of store


[Verse 4] 
Jesus paid it all All to him I owe Sin had left a crimson stain He washed it white as snow


[Verse 5] 
And when before the throne I stand in Him complete I'll lay my trophies down All down at Jesus' feet Lay it down at Jesus feet


[Verse 6] 
End Sin had left a crimson stain He washed it white as snow
