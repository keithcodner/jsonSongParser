[Verse 1] 
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree, You stand in verdant beauty. O Christmas tree O Christmas tree, You stand in verdant beauty. Your boughs are green in summer's glow, And do not fade in winter's snow. O Christmas tree O Christmas tree, You stand in verdant beauty.


[Verse 2] 
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Thy leaves are so unchanging, O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Thy leaves are so unchanging; Not only green when summer's here, But also when 'tis cold and drear. O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Thy leaves are so unchanging!


[Verse 3] 
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Thy candles shine so brightly, O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Thy candles shine so brightly!


[Verse 4] 
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, You bear a wondrous message! O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, You bear a wondrous message! You do proclaim the Savior's birth, Good will to men and peace on earth. O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree, You bear a wondrous message!


[Verse 5] 
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas tree, Of all the trees most lovely; O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Of all the trees most lovely; Each year you bring to me delight Gleaming in the Christmas night. O christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Of all the trees most lovely.


[Verse 6] 
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Your leaves will teach me also, O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Your leaves will teach me also That hope and love and faithfulness Are precious things I can possess. O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, Your leaves will teach me also.
