[Verse 1] 
Praise Him, praise Him Praise Him, praise Him Praise Him, praise Him Praise Him, praise Him


[Verse 2] 
We have assembled To praise the One we love We join the chorus Of angels up above


[Verse 3] 
They sing hosannas And their praises to our King So we join our voices All together now and sing


[Verse 4] 
We are Your children We've come to seek Your face We have come boldly Before the throne of grace To love and worship You And listen to Your voice You are our Father And how our hearts rejoice
