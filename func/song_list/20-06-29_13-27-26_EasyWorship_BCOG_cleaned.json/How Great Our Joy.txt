[Verse 1] 
How great our joy! Great our joy! Joy, joy, joy! Joy, joy, joy! Praise we the Lord in heaven on high! Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!


[Verse 2] 
While by the sheep we watched at night, Glad tidings brought an angel bright.


[Verse 3] 
There shall be born so He did say, In Bethlehem a Child today.


[Verse 4] 
There shall the Child lie in a stall, This Child who shall redeem us all.


[Verse 5] 
This gift of God we'll cherish well, That every joy our hearts shall fill.
