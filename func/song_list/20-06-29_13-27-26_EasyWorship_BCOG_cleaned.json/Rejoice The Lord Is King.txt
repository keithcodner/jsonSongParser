[Verse 1] 
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice; again I say, rejoice.


[Verse 2] 
We soon shall hear the archangel's voice; The trump of God shall sound, rejoice!


[Verse 3] 
Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore; Mortals, give thanks and sing, And triumph evermore.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus the Savior reigns, The God of truth and love; When He had purged our stains, He took His seat above.


[Verse 5] 
His kingdom cannot fail; He rules o'er earth and heaven; The keys of earth and hell Are to our Jesus given.


[Verse 6] 
Rejoice in glorious hope! Jesus the Judge shall come And take His servants up To their eternal home.
