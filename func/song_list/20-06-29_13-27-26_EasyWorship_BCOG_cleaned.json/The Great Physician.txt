[Verse 1] 
Sweetest note in seraph song Sweetest name on mortal tongue Sweetest carol ever sung Jesus, blessed Jesus


[Verse 2] 
The great Physician now is near The sympathizing Jesus He speaks the drooping heart to cheer O hear the voice of Jesus


[Verse 3] 
Your many sins are all forgiven O hear the voice of Jesus Go on your way In peace to heaven, And wear a crown with Jesus


[Verse 4] 
All glory to the dying Lamb I now believe in Jesus I love the blessed Savior's name I love the name of Jesus


[Verse 5] 
And when to that bright world above We rise to be with Jesus We'll sing around the throne of love His name, the name of Jesus.


[Verse 6] 
His name dispels my guilt and fear No other name but Jesus O how my soul delights to hear The precious name of Jesus.
