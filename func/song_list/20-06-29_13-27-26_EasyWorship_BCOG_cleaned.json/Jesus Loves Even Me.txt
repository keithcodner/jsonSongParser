[Verse 1] 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.


[Verse 2] 
I am so glad that our Father in heaven Tells of His love in the book He has giv'n. Wonderful things in the Bible I see. This is the dearest that Jesus loves me.


[Verse 3] 
Tho' I forget Him and wander away, Still He doth love me wherever I stray. Back to His dear loving arms would I flee When I remember that Jesus loves me.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, if there's only one song I can sing, When in His beauty I see the great King, This shall my song in eternity be. Oh what a wonder that Jesus love me.
