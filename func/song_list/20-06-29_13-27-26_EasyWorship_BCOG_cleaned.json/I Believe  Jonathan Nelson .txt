[Verse 1] 
Jehovah, You I trust In You Oh Lord


[Verse 2] 
Jehovah, You I trust In You I believe, I believe


[Verse 3] 
You are the God of miracles You are the God of wonders You are the God all powerful I believe, I believe


[Verse 4] 
I believe, I believe


[Verse 5] 
So long, bye bye So long, bye bye Goodbye to my pain And my sorrow So long, bye bye
