[Verse 1] 
The spacious firmament on high, With all the blue ethereal sky And spangled heav'ns a shining frame; Their great original proclaim. Th'unwearied sun from day to day, Does His Creator's pow'r display And publishes to every land, The work of an Almighty hand.


[Verse 2] 
Soon as the evening shades prevail, The moon takes up the wondrous tale And nightly to the listening earth, Repeats the story of her birth; While all the stars that round her burn And all the planets in their turn Confirm the tidings as they roll, And spread the truth from pole to pole.


[Verse 3] 
What though in solemn silence all, Move round the dark terrestrial ball? What though no real voice nor sound, Amid their radiant orbs be found; In reason's ear they all rejoice And utter forth a glorious voice; Forever singing as they shine, The hand that made us is divine.
