[Verse 1] 
You are my strength When I am weak You are the treasure that I seek You are my all in all


[Verse 2] 
Seeking You as a precious jewel Lord to give up I'll be a fool You are my all in all


[Verse 3] 
Jesus Lamb of God Worthy is Your name


[Verse 4] 
Taking my sin My cross My shame Rising again I'll bless Your name You are my all in all


[Verse 5] 
When I fall down You pick me up When I am dry You fill my cup You are my all in all


[Verse 6] 
Jesus Lamb of God Worthy is Your name
