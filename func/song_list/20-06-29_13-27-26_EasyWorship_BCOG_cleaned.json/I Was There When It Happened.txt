[Verse 1] 
I was there when it happened, And I ought to know, His Spirit burning in me, Set my heart aglow, So I praise the Lord today.


[Verse 2] 
You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me, How I know that all my sins are white as snow. You ask me how I know that He forgave me, Now listen I must tell you how I know.


[Verse 3] 
You ask me how I know that He redeemed me, And how I received the peace no gold can buy. How from the guilt and pow'r of sin He saved me, Made me an heir to mansions in the sky.


[Verse 4] 
And now as thru the world I go rejoicing, I am telling what a Savior dwells within. How I plunged into the cleansing crimson fountain, And Jesus washed my soul from ev'ry sin.
