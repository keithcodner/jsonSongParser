[Verse 1] 
I've wonderd far away from God Now I'm coming home The paths of sin too long I've trod Lord I'm coming home


[Verse 2] 
Coming home, coming home Never more to roam Open wide thine arms of love Now I'm coming home


[Verse 3] 
I've wasted many precious years Now I'm coming home I now repent with bitter tears Lord I'm coming home


[Verse 4] 
I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord Now I'm coming home I'll trust Thy love, believe thy word Lord I'm coming home


[Verse 5] 
My soul is sick, my heart is sore Now I'm coming home My strentgh renew my hope restore Lord I'm coming home


[Verse 6] 
My only hope, my only plea Now I'm coming home That Jesus died, and died for me Lord I'm coming home


[Verse 7] 
I need His cleansing blood, I know Now I'm coming home O wash me whiter than the snow Lord I'm coming home
