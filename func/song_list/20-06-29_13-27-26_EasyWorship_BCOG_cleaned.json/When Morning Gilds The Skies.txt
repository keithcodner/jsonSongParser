[Verse 1] 
When morning gilds the skies, My heart awaking cries; May Jesus Christ be praised! Alike at work and prayer, To Jesus I repair; May Jesus Christ be praised!


[Verse 2] 
Does sadness fill my mind? A solace here I find; May Jesus Christ be praised! Or fades my earthly bliss? My comfort still is this; May Jesus Christ be praised!


[Verse 3] 
The night becomes as day, When from the heart we say, May Jesus Christ be praised! The pow'rs of darkness fear When this sweet chant they hear; May Jesus Christ be praised!


[Verse 4] 
Ye nations of mankind, In this your concord find; May Jesus Christ be praised! Let all the earth around Ring joyous with the sound; May Jesus Christ be praised!


[Verse 5] 
Sing, suns and stars of space, Sing, ye that see His face; May Jesus Christ be praised! God's whole creation o'er, For aye and evermore; May Jesus Christ be praised!


[Verse 6] 
Be this, while life is mine, My canticle divine; May Jesus Christ be praised! Be this the eternal song Thro' all the ages long; May Jesus Christ be praised!


[Verse 7] 
Whene'er the sweet church bell Peals over hill and dell May Jesus Christ be praised! O hark to what it sings, As joyously it rings, May Jesus Christ be praised!
