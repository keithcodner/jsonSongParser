[Verse 1] 
Good-bye world I stay no longer with you Good-bye pleasures of sin I stay no longer with you


[Verse 2] 
I've made up my mind To go God's way the rest of my life I've made up my mind To go God's way the rest of my life


[Verse 3] 
Ive got my mind made up and i wont turn back because im going to see my Jesus some day
