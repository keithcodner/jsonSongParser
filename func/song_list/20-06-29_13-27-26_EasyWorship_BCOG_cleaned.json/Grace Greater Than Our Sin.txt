[Verse 1] 
Grace, grace, God's grace, Grace that will pardon and cleanse within! Grace, grace, God's grace, Grace that is greater than all our sin!


[Verse 2] 
Marvelous grace of our loving Lord, Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt, Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured, There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt!


[Verse 3] 
Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold, Threaten the soul with infinite loss. Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold, Points to the refuge, the mighty Cross.


[Verse 4] 
Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. What can avail to wash it away? Look! There is flowing a crimson tide; Whiter than snow you may be today.


[Verse 5] 
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace, Freely bestowed on all who believe! You that are longing to see His face, Will you this moment His grace receive?
