[Verse 1] 
Praise the Savior, ye who know Him! Who can tell how much we owe Him? Gladly let us render to Him All we are and have.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus is the name that charms us, He for conflict fits and arms us; Nothing moves and nothing harms us While we trust in Him.


[Verse 3] 
Trust in Him, ye saints, forever; He is faithful, changing never. Neither force nor guile can sever Those He loves from Him.


[Verse 4] 
Keep us, Lord, O keep us cleaving to Thyself And still believing; 'Til the hour of our receiving, Promised joys with Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Then we shall be where we would be, Then we shall be what we should be; Things that are not now, nor could be, Soon shall be our own.
