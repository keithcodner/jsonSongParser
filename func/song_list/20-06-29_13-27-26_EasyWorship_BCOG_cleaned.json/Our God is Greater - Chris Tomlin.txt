[Verse 1] 
Water you turned into wine Open the eyes of the blind There's no one like you None like you


[Verse 2] 
Into the darkness you shine Out of the ashes we rise There's no one like you None like you


[Verse 3] 
Our God is greater Our God is stronger God, You are higher than any other Our God is Healer Awesome in power Our God Our God


[Verse 4] 
And if our God is for us Then who could ever stop us? And if our God is with us Then what can stand against?


[Verse 5] 
Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Then what can stand against?
