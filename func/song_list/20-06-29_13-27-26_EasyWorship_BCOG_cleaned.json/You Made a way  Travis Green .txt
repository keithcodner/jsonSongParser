[Verse 1] 
You Made a way Dont know how but You did it You Made a way


[Verse 2] 
Made a way Dont know how but You did it Made a way


[Verse 3] 
Standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test But holding onto faith You know best Nothing can catch You by surprise


[Verse 4] 
You've got this figured out and You've watching us now But when it looks as if we can't win you wrap your arm around and step in And everything we need You supply You got this in control And now we know that


[Verse 5] 
Chorus:


[Verse 6] 
You made a way When our backs were against the wall And it looked as if it was over You made a way And we're standing here Only because You made a way You made a way


[Verse 7] 
Now we're here Looking back on where we come from Because of You and nothing we've done To deserve the love and mercy You've shown But Your grace was strong enough to pick us up


[Verse 8] 
You move mountains you cause walls to fall With Your power You perform miracle There is nothing that's impossible And we're standing here Only because You made a way You made a way


[Verse 9] 
Cause You move mountain You move mountain And everything is easy for You
