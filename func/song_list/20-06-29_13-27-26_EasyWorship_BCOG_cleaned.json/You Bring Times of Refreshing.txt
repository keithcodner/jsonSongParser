[Verse 1] 
Well I thank You Lord That You are my Saviour You're the strength and You're The rock on which I stand


[Verse 2] 
You gave me life and a grace that's greater When I humble myself beneath Your Mighty hand


[Verse 3] 
You bring times of refreshing You bring times of refreshing You bring times of refreshing to my soul


[Verse 4] 
When I'm weary from the fight Trying to do what's right You bring times of refreshing to my soul


[Verse 5] 
Oh the day will come When we'll all be gathered And the Son will rise with healing in His wings Then all the years of pain won't seem to matter When our eyes behold our Saviour and our King
