[Verse 1] 
Free, free from my past, Free from the pain, free from the guilt that would cause me to be ashamed. Once, once I was blind But now I see, Clearly the debt that I owe Jesus paid for me No more chains are bindning me, I'm totally free.


[Verse 2] 
Even my human desires, desire to crucify my soul; Could not outweigh the knowledge of the fact that you made me whole. Time after I remind myself that Your mercies each day are new. Help me, oh Lord, to establish and know That at Calvary I was redeem. You set me...


[Verse 3] 
Even though I was a sinner, You commanded Your grace and Your love towards me; Saved me from death and destruction, gave me life eternally. Not after my sins have You dealt with me, Lord, I'm so grateful all You do.


[Verse 4] 
Iniquity does not dictate my reward; You still tell me You love me and I am Your own. You set me...
