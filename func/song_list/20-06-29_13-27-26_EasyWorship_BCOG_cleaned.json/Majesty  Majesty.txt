[Verse 1] 
Here I am humbled by Your Majesty Covered by Your grace so free Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man Covered by the blood of the Lamb


[Verse 2] 
Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine Since You laid down Your life The greatest sacrifice


[Verse 3] 
Majesty, Majesty Your grace has found me just as I am Empty handed, but alive in Your hands


[Verse 4] 
Majesty, Majesty Forever I am changed by Your love In the presence of Your Majesty


[Verse 5] 
Here I am humbled by the love that You give Forgiven so that I can forgive Here I stand, knowing that I'm Your desire Santified by glory and fire


[Verse 6] 
Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine Since You laid down Your life The greatest sacrifice
