[Verse 1] 
(Verse 1:) Lord if I could buy you a gift to show you my love, tell you how I feel. It wouldn't matter what I'd have to give. I would find a way to get it for you. But fortunately that's not the case and we both know I don't have bank anyway. But I won't let it affect my presentation to you 'cause this is what I bring...


[Verse 2] 
(Chorus:) Here is my heart, my mind, Lord here's my life, my everything. Take it. It's yours oh Lord.


[Verse 3] 
(Verse 2:) I'll give you my all, my everything, every song that I write, Every song that I sing, every day of my life, every breath that I breathe, You gave to me and Lord I rededicate it right back to you. Love of my life, so faithful, so true. I get goosebumps just thinking about you and there's nothing I will not do for you so


[Verse 4] 
(Chorus:) Here is (my) my heart (yeah) my mind (Lord here's my life) Lord here's my life (oh oh oh oh oh oh) my everything (yeah) take it (take it) it's yours oh Lord It's all I have (Repeat chorus and end with "to give")


[Verse 5] 
(Bridge:) I give you my best 'cause I love you... I'm yours
