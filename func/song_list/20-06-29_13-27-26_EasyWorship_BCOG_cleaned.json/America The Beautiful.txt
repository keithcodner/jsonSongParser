[Verse 1] 
O beautiful for spacious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountains majesties Above the fruited plain! America! America! God shed His grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea!


[Verse 2] 
O beautiful for pilgrim feet, Whose stern, impassioned stress A thoroughfare for freedom beat Across the wilderness! America! America! God mend thine ev'ry flaw. Confirm thy soul in self control, Thy liberty in law!


[Verse 3] 
O beautiful for heroes proved In liberating strife, Who more than self their country loved, And mercy more than life! America! America! May God thy gold refine Till all success be nobleness And every gain divine!


[Verse 4] 
O beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years Thine alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed His grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea.


[Verse 5] 
O beautiful for men of faith Who founded this great land; Proclaimed for us, "In God we trust," And held to God's strong hand. America! America! God shed His grace on thee Till lives confess His righteousness From sea to shining sea.
