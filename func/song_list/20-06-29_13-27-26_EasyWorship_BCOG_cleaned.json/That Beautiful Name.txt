[Verse 1] 
That beautiful name! That beautiful name From sin has power to free us! That beautiful name! That wonderful name! That matchless name is Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
I know of a name, a beautiful name That angels brought down to earth. They whispered it low, One night long ago To a maiden of lowly birth.


[Verse 3] 
I know of a name, a beautiful name That unto a babe was given. The stars glittered bright Throughout that glad nigh, And angels praised God in heaven.


[Verse 4] 
The One of that name, my Savior became My Savior of Calvary. My sins nailed Him there, My burdens He bare.


[Verse 5] 
I love that blest name Made higher than all in heaven. 'Twas whispered, I know, In my heart long ago. To Jesus my life I've given.
