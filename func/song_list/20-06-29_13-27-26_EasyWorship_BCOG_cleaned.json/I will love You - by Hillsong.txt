[Verse 1] 
I will love You Lord, my strength I belong to You I will bless You while I live And I will lift my hands up in Your name


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, You alone are holy You alone are holy Name above every name Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy You alone are worthy Jesus, the Lamb that was slain


[Verse 3] 
Nailed to the cross for me Died and rose again You redeemed me to the Father by Your blood You cleansed me from all sin
