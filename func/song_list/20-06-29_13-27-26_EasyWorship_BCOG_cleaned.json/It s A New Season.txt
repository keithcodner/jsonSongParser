[Verse 1] 
It's a new season, it's a new day A fresh anointing is flowing my way It's a season of power and prosperity It's a new season coming to me


[Verse 2] 
The devil's time is up no longer can he bother me, 'cause the Creator of the universe He fathers me, and it's transferable my children's children shall be free it's a new season (it's a new season).


[Verse 3] 
If you don't know by now, you need to know it's jubilee where debts are cancel and your children walk in victory It's so available to you right now just taste and see it's a new season (it's a new season)


[Verse 4] 
The new millennium presents a new horizon and no greater time for us to make a choice and take a stand All that we need, is resting in His hands it's a new season (it's a new season)


[Verse 5] 
All that was stolen is returned to you a hundred fold Tried in the fire but you're coming out gold Cling to His hand,yes, to every promise take a hold it's a new season (it's a new season)
