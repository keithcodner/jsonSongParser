[Verse 1] 
The truth can hurt you Or the truth can change you What would truth do to you


[Verse 2] 
I just wanna be happy But if I keep on doing the things That keep on bringing me pain There's no one else I can blame


[Verse 3] 
If I'm not happy Wasted time but now I can see The biggest enemy, it was me So I'm not happy


[Verse 4] 
Cry yourself to sleep Shout and raise your hands It won't change a thing child Until you understand (Preach)


[Verse 5] 
If you're tired of being the same If you're tired of things not changing It's time for you to get out the way


[Verse 6] 
Don't get stuck in how you feel Say Jesus take the wheel He knows the road that you need to take (But it only works if)


[Verse 7] 
If you wanna be happy (Look at yourself and say) Don't you wanna be happy I just wanna be happy


[Verse 8] 
But if I keep on giving my heart For people to tear apart The healing will never start So I can be happy Will I ever be happy


[Verse 9] 
Cry yourself to sleep Shout and raise your hands It won't change a thing child Until you understand


[Verse 10] 
If you're tired of being the same If you're tired of things not changing It's time for you to get out the way (You been down too long)


[Verse 11] 
Don't get stuck in how you feel Say Jesus take the wheel He knows the road that you need to take (I feel different right here)


[Verse 12] 
It's so easy to complain Addicted to the pain You give your heart, they push it away (But I got good news for ya)


[Verse 13] 
Jesus knows just how you feel Just let Him take the wheel The love you need, He already gave (But the question is)


[Verse 14] 
Do you wanna be happy (If you're tired of you then say) I just wanna be happy (Now if you really mean that, open up your heart and say it)


[Verse 15] 
Let me hear you say yeah Yeah yeah (If you're tired of going in circles) Let me hear you say yeah Yeah yeah(2x)


[Verse 16] 
If you're tired of being the same If you're tired of things not changing It's time for you to get out the way (Are you ready, come on)


[Verse 17] 
Don't get stuck in how you feel Say Jesus take the wheel (Won't He do it) He knows the road that you need to take (So easy to complain)


[Verse 18] 
It's so easy to complain (Come on) Addicted to the pain You give your heart, they push it away (There's somebody that'll never leave ya)


[Verse 19] 
Jesus knows just how you feel Just let Him take the wheel The love you need, He already gave (But the question is)


[Verse 20] 
Do you wanna be happy (Took a long time but I'm ready) I just wanna be happy(2x)
