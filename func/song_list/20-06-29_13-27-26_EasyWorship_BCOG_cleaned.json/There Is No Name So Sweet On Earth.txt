[Verse 1] 
We love to sing of Christ our King And hail Him blessed Jesus; For there's no word ear ever heard, So dear, so sweet as Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
There is no name so sweet on earth, No name so sweet in heaven; The name before His wondrous birth, To Christ the Savior given.


[Verse 3] 
And when He hung upon the tree, They wrote this name above Him; That all might see the reason we, For evermore must love Him.


[Verse 4] 
So now upon His Father's throne, Almighty to release us; From sin and pain He ever reigns, The Prince and Savior Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
O Jesus, by that matchless name, Thy grace shall fail us never; Today as yesterday the same, Thou art the same forever.
