[Verse 1] 
We have come into this house And gathered in His Name To worship Him Worship Him, Christ the Lord


[Verse 2] 
So forget about yourself And concentrate on Him And worship Him Worship Him, Christ the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Let us lift up holy hands And magnify His Name And worship Him Worship Him, Christ the Lord


[Verse 4] 
He is all my righteousness I stand complete in Him And worship Him Worship Him, Christ the Lord
