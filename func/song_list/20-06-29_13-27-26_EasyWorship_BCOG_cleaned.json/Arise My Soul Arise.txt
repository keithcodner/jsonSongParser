[Verse 1] 
Arise, my soul, arise, Shake off thy guilty fears; The bleeding sacrifice In my behalf appears; Before the throne my surety stands, My name is written on His hands, My name is written on His hands.


[Verse 2] 
He ever lives above, for me to intercede; His all redeeming love His precious blood to plead; His blood atoned for all our race, And sprinkles now the throne of grace, And sprinkles now the throne of grace.


[Verse 3] 
The Father hears Him pray, His dear Anointed One; He cannot turn away The presence of His Son: His Spirit answers to the blood, And tells me I am born of God, And tells me I am born of God.


[Verse 4] 
My God is reconciled, His pardoning voice I hear; He owns me for His child, I can no longer fear; With confidence I now draw nigh, And Father, Abba Father cry, And Father, Abba Father cry!
