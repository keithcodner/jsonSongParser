[Verse 1] 
I know who I am I know who I am I know who I am I am yours I am yours


[Verse 2] 
And you are mine Jesus you are mine You are mine Jesus you are mine


[Verse 3] 
I was running, and you found me I was blind, and you gave me sight You put a song of praise in me I was broken and you healed me I was dying and You gave me life Lord you are my identity


[Verse 4] 
I know I know I know I know
