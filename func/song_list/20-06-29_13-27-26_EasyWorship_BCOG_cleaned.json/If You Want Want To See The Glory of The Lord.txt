[Verse 1] 
If you want to see the glory of the Lord Why don't you praise Him Lift up your hands and praise Him


[Verse 2] 
If you want to see the glory of the Lord Why don't you lift up your hands and praise the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Praise Him in the morning Praise Him in the noontime Praise Him in the evening Praise Him all the day long Lift up your hands and praise the Lord
