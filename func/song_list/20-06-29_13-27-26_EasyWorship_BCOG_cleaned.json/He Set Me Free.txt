[Verse 1] 
He set me free Yes He set me free And He broke the bonds Of prison for me I'm glory bound My Jesus to see For glory to God He set me free


[Verse 2] 
Once like a bird In prison I dwelt No freedom From my sorrow I felt But Jesus came And listened to me And glory to God He set me free


[Verse 3] 
Now I am climbing Higher each day Darkness of night Has drifted away My feet are planted On higher ground And glory to God I'm homeward bound


[Verse 4] 
Good-bye to sin And things that confound Naught of the world Shall turn me around Daily I'm working I'm praying too And glory to God I'm going thru
