[Verse 1] 
Christ our Redeemer died on the cross Died for the sinner paid all his due All who receive Him need never fear For He will pass, He will pass over You


[Verse 2] 
When I see the Blood When I see the Blood When I see the Blood I will pass, I will pass over You


[Verse 3] 
Chiefest of sinners Jesus can save As he has promised so will He do O sinner hear Him trust in His word Then He will pass will He pass over you


[Verse 4] 
Judgment is coming all will be there Who have rejected who have refused O sinner hasten let Jesus in Then God will pass, He will pass over You


[Verse 5] 
O what compassion, O boundless love Jesus hath power, Jesus is true All who believe are safe from the storm O He will pass, He will pass over You
