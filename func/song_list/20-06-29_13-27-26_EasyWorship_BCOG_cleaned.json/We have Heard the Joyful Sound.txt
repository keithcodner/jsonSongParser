[Verse 1] 
We have heard the joyful sound: Jesus saves! Jesus Saves! Spread the tidings all around: Jesus saves! Jesus Saves! Bear the news to every land, Climb the steeps and cross the waves; On ward!-'tisour Lord's command; Jesus saves! Jesus Saves!


[Verse 2] 
Waft in on the rolling tide, Jesus saves, Jesus saves; Tell to sinners far and wide, Jesus saves, Jesus saves; Sing, ye islands to the sea, Echo back, ye ocean caves; Earth shall keep her jubilee, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.


[Verse 3] 
Sing above the battle's strife, Jesus saves, Jesus saves; By His death and endless life, Jesus saves, Jesus saves; Sing it softy thru the gloom, When mercy craves, Sing in triumph o'er the tomb, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.


[Verse 4] 
Give the winds a mighty voice, Jesus saves, Jesus saves; Let the nations now rejoice. Jesus saves, Jesus saves; Shout salvation full and free, Highest hills and deepest caves, This is our song of victory, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
