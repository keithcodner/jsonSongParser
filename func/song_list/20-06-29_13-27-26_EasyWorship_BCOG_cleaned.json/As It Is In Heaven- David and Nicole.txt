[Verse 1] 
I wanna see what you see I wanna hear what you hear I wanna speak what you speak


[Verse 2] 
Declaring Your will in the Earth As it is in Heaven


[Verse 3] 
I wanna say what you say Learn how to walk in your way I'm gonna pray what you pray


[Verse 4] 
Declaring Your will in the Earth As it is in Heaven


[Verse 5] 
Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done Here in the Earth As it is in Heaven


[Verse 6] 
Thine is the Kingdom Thine is the Power Thine is the Glory Forever and Ever
