[Verse 1] 
My heart cries, my heart cries For more of you My heart cries, my heart cries For more of you


[Verse 2] 
I want to see your face Feel your embrace Come fill the empty place Inside my heart Under your wing is where I long to be Just you and me Never apart


[Verse 3] 
I want more I need more So much more Give us more
