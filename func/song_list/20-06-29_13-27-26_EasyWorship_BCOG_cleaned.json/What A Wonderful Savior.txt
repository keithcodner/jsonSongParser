[Verse 1] 
What a wonderful Savior, Is Jesus my Jesus! What a wonderful Savior, Is Jesus my Lord!


[Verse 2] 
Christ has for sin atonement made; What a wonderful Savior! We are redeemed, the price is paid; What a wonderful Savior!


[Verse 3] 
I praise Him for the cleansing blood; What a wonderful Savior! That reconciled my soul to God; What a wonderful Savior!


[Verse 4] 
He cleansed my heart from all its sin; What a wonderful Savior! And now He reigns and rules therein; What a wonderful Savior!


[Verse 5] 
He gives me overcoming power; What a wonderful Savior! And triumph in each trying hour; What a wonderful Savior!


[Verse 6] 
To Him I've given all my heart; What a wonderful Savior! The world shall never share a part; What a wonderful Savior!


[Verse 7] 
He walks beside me in the way; What a wonderful Savior! And keeps me faithful day by day; What a wonderful Savior!
