[Verse 1] 
There's a wideness in God's mercy Like the wideness of the sea; There's a kindness in His justice, Which is more than liberty.


[Verse 2] 
There is welcome for the sinner, And more graces for the good. There is mercy with the Savior; There is healing in His blood.


[Verse 3] 
For the love of God is broader Than the measure of man's mind; And the heart of the Eternal Is most wonderfully kind.


[Verse 4] 
If our love were but more simple, We should take Him at His word; And our lives would be all sunshine In the sweetness of our Lord.


[Verse 5] 
There is plentiful redemption In the blood that has been shed; There is joy for all the members In the sorrows of the Head.
