[Verse 1] 
My flame, my light My lamp, my heat Brighten my path to guide my feet Anoint my head and fill my cup Oh Lord You're everything to me


[Verse 2] 
Everything to me Everything to me Everything to me Everything


[Verse 3] 
When I felt lost and alone You came and changed my story On the pages of my life You have revealed Your glory Oh Lord You're everything to me


[Verse 4] 
My start, my now My close, my end The Lover of my soul, my friend Oh Lord You are my everything My Father, God My Lord and King


[Verse 5] 
You heal and cause Life to increase You are the cure for my disease My purpose and destiny Oh Lord You're everything to me
