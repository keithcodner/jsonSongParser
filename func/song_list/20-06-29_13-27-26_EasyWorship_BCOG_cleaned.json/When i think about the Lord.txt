[Verse 1] 
When i think about the lord How He saved me, how He raise me, How He filled me, with the Holy Ghost. How He healed me, to the uttermost.


[Verse 2] 
When i think about the Lord How He picked me up and turned me around, How He placed my feet on solid ground


[Verse 3] 
It makes me wanna shout, Hallelujah, Thank you jesus LORD, your worthy, of all the glory, and all the honor And all the praise.
