[Verse 1] 
Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim, And publish abroad His wonderful name; The name all victorious, of Jesus extol, His kingdom is glorious, He rules over all.


[Verse 2] 
God ruleth on high, almighty to save, And still He is nigh, His presence we have; The great congregation His triumph shall sing, Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.


[Verse 3] 
Salvation to God who sits on the throne, Let all cry aloud and honor the Son; The praises of Jesus the angels proclaim; Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.


[Verse 4] 
Then let us adore and give Him His right; All glory and pow'r all wisdom and might. All honor and blessing with angels above, And thanks never ceasing and infinite love. Amen.
