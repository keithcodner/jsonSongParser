[Verse 1] 
My heart and flesh cry out For you, the living God I ask no more than this To see the living God


[Verse 2] 
My soul follows after you, after you Oh, my soul follows after you


[Verse 3] 
Oh what a lovely home You have prepared for me Here in your love i'll stay Through all eternity


[Verse 4] 
My soul follows after you, after you Oh my soul follows after you Oh my soul follows after you, after you Oh my soul follows after you


[Verse 5] 
Better is one day Than thousands without you I'd trade a thousand For one day beside you
