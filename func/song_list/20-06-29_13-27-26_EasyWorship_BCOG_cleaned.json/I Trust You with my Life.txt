[Verse 1] 
I'm not afraid of the darkness I'm not afraid of the night As long as you are always with me Then everything will be alright


[Verse 2] 
You're walking there behind me You're walking there before me You're walking there beside me I trust you with my Li-i-i-ife I trust you with my Life


[Verse 3] 
I'm not afraid of anybody I'm not afraid of what they say As long as your talking with me Then everything will be okay


[Verse 4] 
You're walking there behind me You're walking there before me You're walking there beside me I trust you with my Li-i-i-ife I trust you with my Li-i-i-ife I trust you with my Life I trust you with my Life
