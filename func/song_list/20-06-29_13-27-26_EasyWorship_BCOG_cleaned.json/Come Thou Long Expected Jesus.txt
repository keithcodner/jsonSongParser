[Verse 1] 
Come, Thou long expected Jesus, Born to set Thy people free. From our fears and sins release us; Let us find our rest in Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Born Thy people to deliver, Born a Child, and yet a King. Born to reign in us forever, Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.


[Verse 3] 
By Thine own eternal Spirit Rule in all our hearts alone; By Thine all sufficient merit, Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
