[Verse 1] 
Behold the lamb Who was scorned Who was mocked Who was abandoned Behold the Lamb Who was crushed Who was slain Who was broken


[Verse 2] 
By Your wounds we are healed Hallelujah for the blood that was spilled


[Verse 3] 
You alone Are worthy Are worthy to be praised You alone Are worthy Are worthy to be praised


[Verse 4] 
Behold the Lamb Who was raised Who’s alive Who has overcome Behold the Lamb who is here Who’s at work Who’s among us


[Verse 5] 
Glory be to the Son Hallelujah for the things You have done Jesus
