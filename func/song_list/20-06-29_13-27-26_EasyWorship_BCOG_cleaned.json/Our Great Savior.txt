[Verse 1] 
Hallelujah what a Savior. Hallelujah what a Friend. Saving, helping, keeping, loving, He is with me to the end.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus! What a friend for sinners! Jesus lover of my soul! Friends may fail me, foes assail me; He, my Savior, makes me whole.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus! What a strength in weakness! Let me hide myself in Him; Tempted tried and sometimes failing, He, my strength my victory wins.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus! What a help in sorrow! While the billows o'er me roll, Even when my heart is breaking, He, my Comfort helps my soul.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus! What a guide and keeper! While the tempest still is high, Storms about me, night o'ertakes me, He, my pilot hears my cry.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus! I do now receive Him; More than all in Him I find. He hath granted me forgiveness; I am His and He is mine.
