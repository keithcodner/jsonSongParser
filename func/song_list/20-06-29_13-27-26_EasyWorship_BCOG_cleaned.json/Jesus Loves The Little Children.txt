[Verse 1] 
Jesus loves the little children, All the children of the world. Red and yellow, black and white, They are precious in His sight-- Jesus loves the little children of the world.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus died for all the children, All the children of the world. Red and yellow, black and white, All are precious in His sight-- Jesus died for all the children of the world.
