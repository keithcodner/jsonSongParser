[Verse 1] 
Is there a way to show the passion in my heart? Can I express how truly great I think You are? My dearest Friend This is my desire To pour my love on You


[Verse 2] 
Like oil upon Your feet Like wine for You to drink Like water from my heart I pour my love on You With praises like perfume I lavish mine on You Till every drop is gone I pour my love on You
