[Verse 1] 
As we enter in to worship you You're the king of kings, we honour you No one's greater than the God we serve You are high above all


[Verse 2] 
Consume us with your presence now To see your face is what my heart desires Surround us with your love and grace Let your train fill this holy place


[Verse 3] 
We long for your glory Please send down your glory How we need your glory Let it be revealed


[Verse 4] 
We need fresh oil We need it to drench us from above Nothing else matters Please let your glory cover us (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
Oooooooo, Oooooooo Oooooooo, Oooooooo
