[Verse 1] 
Nearer, my God, to Thee; Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!


[Verse 2] 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me! Still all my song shall be,


[Verse 3] 
Though like the wanderer, The sun gone down, Darkness be over me, My rest a stone; Yet in my dreams I'd be,


[Verse 4] 
There let the way appear, Steps unto heaven; All that Thou sendest me, In mercy given; Angels to beckon me,


[Verse 5] 
Then, with my waking thoughts Bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise, So by my woes to be,


[Verse 6] 
Or if, on joyful wing Cleaving the sky, Sun, moon, and stars forgot, Upward I fly, Still all my song shall be,
