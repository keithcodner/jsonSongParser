[Verse 1] 
Jesus Jesus Lord to me Master Savior Prince of Peace Ruler of my heart today Jesus Lord to me (to me)


[Verse 2] 
If I had seen the sunset On the day that Jesus died And felt the glow of the sunrise When the tomb was opened wide Would I have known You Would I have seen that You were more than just a man You were Lord and King But now I know You and I can see That You are Lord of all You are Lord to me
