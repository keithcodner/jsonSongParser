[Verse 1] 
I climbed up to the highest mountain Looked all around, couldn't find nobody Went down into the deepest valley Looked all around down there, couldn't find nobody


[Verse 2] 
I went across the deep blue sea Couldn't find none to compare To Your grace, Your love, Your mercy Nobody greater, Nobody greater nobody greater than You


[Verse 3] 
Searched all over, couldn't find nobody Looked high and low, still couldn't find nobody Nobody greater, nobody greater no, nobody greater than you.


[Verse 4] 
Nobody can heal like you can Oh most holy one you are the great I Am Awesome in all your ways and mighty is your hand You are He who carried out redemption's plan You are He who carried out redemption's plan


[Verse 5] 
Nobody greater, nobody greater no, nobody than you.
