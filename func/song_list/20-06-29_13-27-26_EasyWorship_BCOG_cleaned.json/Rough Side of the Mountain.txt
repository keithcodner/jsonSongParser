[Verse 1] 
Oh Lord, I'm strivin', tryin' to make it through this barren land, but as I go from day to day, I can hear my Savior say, "trust me child, come on and hold my hand."


[Verse 2] 
I'm comin' up on the rough side of the mountain, I must hold to God, His powerful hand. I'm comin' up on the rough side of the mountain, I'm doin' my best to make it in.


[Verse 3] 
I'm comin' up Lord, although my burdens sometime they press me down, but if I can only keep this faith I'll have strength just to run this race; I'm lookin' for my starry crown.


[Verse 4] 
I'm comin' up on the rough side of the mountain, I must hold to God, His powerful hand. I'm comin' up on the rough side of the mountain, I'm doin' my best to make it in.


[Verse 5] 
This old race will be soon be over, there'll be no more race for me to run. And I will stand before God's throne, all my heartaches will be gone, I'll hear my Savior say, "welcome home".


[Verse 6] 
I'm comin' up on the rough side of the mountain, I must hold to God, His powerful hand. I'm comin' up on the rough side of the mountain, I'm doin' my best to make it in.
