[Verse 1] 
Long before You ever said let there be light Long after this world has had it's final night Great God in heaven You'll be where You've always been Seated on Your holy throne


[Verse 2] 
King of kings looking down on men You are ruler above all the nations Sovereign through all generations Lord You reign


[Verse 3] 
One day all kings will tremble before You I will bow down and adore You Lord You reign


[Verse 4] 
Morning and night the sky shouts Your majesty Saying the whole universe is under Your feet This is the peace in my heart The strength of my soul Whatever happens in life This much I know You are in control


[Verse 5] 
There is none like You Lord You are worthy Ev'rything You do always is perfect There is none like You Lord You are worthy Ev'rything You do always is perfect
