[Verse 1] 
Holy Spirit Thou art welcome in this place Holy Spirit Thou art welcome in this place Omnipotent Father of mercy and grace Thou art welcome in this place


[Verse 2] 
Lord in Thy presence there's healing divine No other power can save Lord but Thine Holy Spirit Thou art welcome in this place Thou art welcome in this place


[Verse 3] 
Fill all the hungry and empty within Restore us oh Father revive us again Holy Spirit Thou art welcome in this place Thou art welcome in this place
