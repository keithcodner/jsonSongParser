[Verse 1] 
Precious name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of heaven. Precious name, O how sweet! Hope of earth and joy of heaven.


[Verse 2] 
Take the name of Jesus with you. Child of sorrow and of woe. It will joy and comfort give you; Take it then where'er you go.


[Verse 3] 
Take the name of Jesus ever, As a shield from every snare. If temptations round you gather, Breathe that holy name in prayer.


[Verse 4] 
O the precious name of Jesus! How it thrills our souls with joy. When His loving arms receive us And His songs our tongues employ!


[Verse 5] 
At the name of Jesus bowing, Falling prostrate at His feet. King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him, When our journey is complete.
