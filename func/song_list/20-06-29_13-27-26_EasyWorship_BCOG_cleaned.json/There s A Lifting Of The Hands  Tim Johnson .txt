[Verse 1] 
There's a lifting of the hands There's a lifting of the heart There's a lifting of the eyes Beyond the hills To where my help comes from


[Verse 2] 
We will lift up our hands We will lift up our hearts We will lift up our eyes Beyond the hills To where our help comes from


[Verse 3] 
Our help come from You We lift up our hands Our help comes from You We lift up our hearts Our help comes from You We lift up our eyes To where our help comes from


[Verse 4] 
We realize where our help comes from
