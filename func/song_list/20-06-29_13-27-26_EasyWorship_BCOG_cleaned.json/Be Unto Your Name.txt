We are a moment You are forever Lord of the ages God before time

Holy, holy Lord God Almighty Worthy is the Lamb who was slain Highest praises, honor and glory Be unto Your name Be unto Your name

We are the broken You are the Healer Jesus, Redeemer Mighty to save

You are the love song We'll sing forever Bowing before You Blessing Your name
