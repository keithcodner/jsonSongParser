[Verse 1] 
Now I want to say Holy is Your name Let all creation proclaim Holy is Your name


[Verse 2] 
Now I praise You Lord of all creation You ordain the sun to rise and fall You scatter the stars across the heavens You come close enough to hear me call


[Verse 3] 
Your love is the shelter over my soul You fill me with the wonder of a child You will heal the humble and the broken Mercy flows like a river running wild


[Verse 4] 
On the highest mountain I will lift my heart to the sky From the lowest valley Hear my cry
