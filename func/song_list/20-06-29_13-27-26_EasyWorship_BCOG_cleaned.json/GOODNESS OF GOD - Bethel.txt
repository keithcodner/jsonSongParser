[Verse 1] 
I love You Lord Oh Your mercy never fails me All my days I’ve been held in Your hands From the moment that I wake up Until I lay my head I will sing of the goodness of God (x2)


[Verse 2] 
All my life You have been faithful All my life You have been so, so good With every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God (x2)


[Verse 3] 
I love Your voice You have led me through the fire In darkest nights You are close like no other I’ve known You as a father I’ve known You as a friend I have lived in the goodness of God (x2)


[Verse 4] 
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me (x2) With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now, I give You everything Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
