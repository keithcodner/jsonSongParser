[Verse 1] 
There is a river who's streams Make glad the city of God


[Verse 2] 
I will rejoice I will rejoice And be glad


[Verse 3] 
There is a fountain full of grace And it flows from Emmaunel's veins It came and it healed me It camed and refreshed me And it came and washed my sins away


[Verse 4] 
He has made me glad He has made me glad I will rejoice I will rejoice
