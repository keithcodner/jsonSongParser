[Verse 1] 
Your only Son No sin to hide But you have sent Him, From your side To walk upon the guilty sod And to become the lamb of God


[Verse 2] 
Your gift of love They crucified They laughed and scorned Him as He died The humble king They named a fraud And sacrificed the Lamb of God


[Verse 3] 
Oh Lamb of God, Sweet Lamb of God I love the Holy Lamb of God


[Verse 4] 
Oh wash me in His precious Blood My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God


[Verse 5] 
I was so lost I should have died But You have brought me to Your side To be led by Your staff and rod And to be call Lamb of God
