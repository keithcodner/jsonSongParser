[Verse 1] 
I've got a mansion Just over the hilltop In that bright land Where we'll never grow old And someday yonder We will never more wander But walk the streets That are purest gold


[Verse 2] 
I'm satisfied With just a cottage below A little silver And a little gold But in that city Where the ransomed will shine I want a gold one That's silver lined


[Verse 3] 
Tho' often tempted Tormented and tested And like the prophet My pillow's a stone And tho' I find here No permanent dwelling I know He'll give me A mansion my own


[Verse 4] 
Don't think me poor Or deserted or lonely I'm not discouraged I'm heaven bound I'm just a pilgrim In search of a city I want a mansion A harp and a crown
