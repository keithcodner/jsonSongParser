[Verse 1] 
All the sold out people


[Verse 2] 
You ready to Praise him Come on, come on Put your hands together


[Verse 3] 
My God, he loves me (oh yes) He says I am his child (he calls) He calls me righteous (say say say) Says I'm the apple of his eye So why do I clap my hands And why do I stomp my feet Why do I scream so loud I ain't no lunatic, I'm not fanatic I'm just addicted to the one who saved me


[Verse 4] 
I'm sold out, no matter what they say Made up my mind I am a fool for Christ Sold out, every day what I do and say Will give him all the praise (repeat)


[Verse 5] 
I am a warrior (no more) No more chains holding me (more than) More than a conquerer (his spirit) His spirit lives in me So why do I clap my hands And why do I stomp my feet Why do I scream so loud I ain't no lunatic, I'm not fanatic I'm just addicted to the one who saved me Bridge


[Verse 6] 
I am so glad to the one who saved me Because of his blood I am free I don't have time though what people might say, I'm not ashamed to give him praise (I ain't no lunatic, I'm not fanatic, I'm just addicted to the one who saved me)
