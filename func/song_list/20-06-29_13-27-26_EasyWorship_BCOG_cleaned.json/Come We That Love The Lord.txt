[Verse 1] 
Come, we that love the Lord, And let our joys be known; Join in a song with sweet accord, And thus surround the throne.


[Verse 2] 
Let those refuse to sing, Who never knew our God; But children of the heavenly King, May speak their joys abroad.


[Verse 3] 
The hill of Zion yields A thousand sacred sweets, Before we reach the heavenly fields, Or walk the golden streets.


[Verse 4] 
Then let our songs abound, And every tear be dry; We're marching thru Emmanuel's ground, To fairer worlds on high.


[Verse 5] 
The men of grace have found Glory begun below; Celestial fruit on earthly ground From faith and hope may grow.
