[Verse 1] 
I sought the Lord And He answered me And delivered me From every fear Those who look on Him Are radiant They'll never be ashamed They'll never be ashamed This poor man cried And the Lord heard me And saved me from My enemies The Son of God Surrounds His saints He will deliver them He will deliver them (REF) Magnify the Lord with me Come exalt His name together Glorify the Lord with me Come exalt His name forever Taste and see That the Lord is good Oh blessed is he Who hides in Him Oh fear the Lord Oh all you saints He'll give you everything He'll give you everything (REF) Bridge Let us bless the Lord Every day and night Never ending praise May our incense rise (REF) Taste and see That the Lord is good He'll give you everything He'll give you everything<fLucida Sans Unicode>ï»¿ </f>https://lyricstranslate.comhttps://lyricstranslate.com
