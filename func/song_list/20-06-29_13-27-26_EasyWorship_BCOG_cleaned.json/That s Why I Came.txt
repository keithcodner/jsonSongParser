[Verse 1] 
To Glorify To Magnify I lift my hands up high That's why I came. To give you reverence I'll sing towards the heavens Your glory I will proclaim Over and over again My heart can truly say That's why I came.


[Verse 2] 
At times we can get so busy We miss what you're really trying to say, Not taking the time to listen; Finding other things to do throughout the day.


[Verse 3] 
I don't want the blessing of yesterday But I'm looking for something fresh and new Can't pretend like I've got it all together 'Cause Father, you see me through and through


[Verse 4] 
But I've come to the conclusion Without you, there's only confusion Resisting the artificial, attaining the real You are my one true solution. For this reason, I cameâ€¦


[Verse 5] 
Outro It's not about me It's all about you
