[Verse 1] 
When I think upon your goodness And your faithfulness each day I'm convinced it's not because I am worthy To receive the kind of love that you give


[Verse 2] 
But i'm grateful for your mercy, And i'm grateful for your grace And because of how you've poured out yourself I have come to sing this song out in praise


[Verse 3] 
Imela! Imela! (Thank you! Thank You) Okaka, Onyekeruwa (Great and Mighty creator of the world) Imela! Imela! (Thank you! Thank You) Eze m Oh (My King)


[Verse 4] 
Who am I to sing your praises? Who am I to worship you? It's your blood that makes the difference in me And made a way to enter into your throne


[Verse 5] 
I could never sing your song But the sacrifice on Calvary's tree Is the reason I can cry out today


[Verse 6] 
Imela! Imela! (Thank you! Thank You) Okaka, Onyekeruwa (Great and Mighty creator of the world)


[Verse 7] 
Imela! Imela! (Thank you! Thank You) Eze m Oh (My King) Eze m Oh (My King)


[Verse 8] 
Onyedikagi? Ekene diri gi (Who is like you? All glory belongs to you) Onyene mema (He who does good)


[Verse 9] 
Onyedikagi? Ekene diri gi (Who is like you? All glory belongs to you) Onye nagworia (Mighty healer)


[Verse 10] 
Imela! Imela! (Thank you! Thank You) Okaka, Onyekeruwa (Great and Mighty creator of the world)


[Verse 11] 
Imela! Imela! (Thank you! Thank You) Eze m Oh (My King)


[Verse 12] 
Eze m Oh (My King) Eze m Oh (My King) Eze m Oh (My King)
