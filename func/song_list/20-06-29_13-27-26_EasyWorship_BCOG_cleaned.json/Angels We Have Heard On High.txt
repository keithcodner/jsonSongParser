[Verse 1] 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! Gloria, in excelsis Deo!


[Verse 2] 
Angels we have heard on high, Sweetly singing o'er the plains; And the mountains in reply, Echoing their joyous strains.


[Verse 3] 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! Gloria, in excelsis Deo!


[Verse 4] 
Shepherds, why this jubilee? Why your joyous strains prolong? Say what may the tidings be; Which inspire your heav'nly song?


[Verse 5] 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! Gloria, in excelsis Deo!


[Verse 6] 
Come to Bethlehem and see, Him whose birth the angels sing; Come adore on bended knee, Christ the Lord, the newborn King.


[Verse 7] 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! Gloria, in excelsis Deo!


[Verse 8] 
See within a manger laid, Jesus, Lord of heav'n and earth; Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, With us sing our Savior's birth.


[Verse 9] 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo! Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
