[Verse 1] 
Amazing love! How can it be That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?


[Verse 2] 
And can it be that I should gain An interest in the Savior's blood? Died He for me, who caused His pain? For me, who Him to death pursued?


[Verse 3] 
He left His Father's throne above, So free, so infinite His grace; Emptied Himself of all but love, And bled for Adam's helpless race. 'Tis mercy all, immense and free! For, O my God it found out me!


[Verse 4] 
No condemnation now I dread; Jesus, and all in Him, is mine! Alive in Him my living Head, And clothed in righteousness divine, Bold I approach the eternal throne, And claim the crown, through Christ my own.


[Verse 5] 
'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies! Who can explore His strange design? In vain the first born seraph tries To sound the depths of love divine! 'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore, Let angel minds inquire no more.


[Verse 6] 
Long my imprisoned Spirit lay Fast bound in sin and nature's night; Thine eye diffused a quickening ray, I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; My chains fell off, my heart was free; I rose, went forth and followed Thee.
