[Verse 1] 
We are salt and light Called to break the powers of night And by the love of God Proclaim His liberty


[Verse 2] 
We're ambassadors of grace And in His name we take this place Lord let Your will be done Let Your kingdom come Lord let it rain Let it rain


[Verse 3] 
Let Your blessings pour on this city Lord Let it rain Let Your blessings pour on this city Lord Let it rain


[Verse 4] 
As we sing Your praises Break the curses let it rain Hear Your people praying Send Your blessing let it rain Lord Let it rain


[Verse 5] 
You have won the fight, oh Lord By Your death our lives restored And You have risen now To vanquish all our foes


[Verse 6] 
Come abolish every curse O'er the nations of the earth And in Your name we'll go To proclaim You rose to live and reign Lord come and reign
