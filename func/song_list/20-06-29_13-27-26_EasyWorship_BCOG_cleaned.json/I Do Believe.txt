[Verse 1] 
I do believe, I now believe That Jesus died for me;


[Verse 2] 
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee; No other help I know. If Thou withdraw thyself from me, Ah, whither shall I go?


[Verse 3] 
What did Thine only Son endure Before I drew my breath! What pain, what labor, To secure my soul from endless death!


[Verse 4] 
Author of faith, to Thee I lift My weary, longing eyes. Oh, let me now receive that gift; My soul, without it, dies.


[Verse 5] 
Surely Thou canst not let me die; Oh, speak, and I shall live. And here I will unwearied lie Till Thou Thy Spirit give.


[Verse 6] 
How would my fainting soul rejoice Could I but see Thy face! now let me hear Thy quick'ning voice, And taste Thy pard'ning grace.
