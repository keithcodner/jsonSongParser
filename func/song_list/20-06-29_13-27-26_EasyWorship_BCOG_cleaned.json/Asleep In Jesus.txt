[Verse 1] 
Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep, From which none ever wakes to weep! A calm and undisturbed repose, Unbroken by the last of foes.


[Verse 2] 
Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet, To be for such a slumber meet! With holy confidence to sing, That death hath lost its venomed sting.


[Verse 3] 
Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest, Whose waking is supremely blest! No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour That manifests the Savior's pow'r.


[Verse 4] 
Asleep in Jesus! O for me May such a blissful refuge be! Securely shall my ashes lie, And wait the summons from on high.
