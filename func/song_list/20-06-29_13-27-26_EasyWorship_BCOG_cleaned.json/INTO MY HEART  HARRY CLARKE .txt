[Verse 1] 
Into my heart Into my heart Come into my heart Lord Jesus Come in today Come in to stay Come into my heart Lord Jesus


[Verse 2] 
Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature O thou of God and man the Son Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown


[Verse 3] 
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight And all the twinkling starry host Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer Than all the angels heaven can boast


[Verse 4] 
Beautiful Savior, Lord of all the nations Son of God and Son of man Glory and honor, praise, adoration Now and forever more be Thine Now and forever more be Thine
