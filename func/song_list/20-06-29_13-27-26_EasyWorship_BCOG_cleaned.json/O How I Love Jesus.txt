[Verse 1] 
O, how I love Jesus, O, how I love Jesus, O, how I love Jesus; Because He first loved me.


[Verse 2] 
To me He is so wonderful, To me He is so wonderful, To me He is so wonderful; Because He first loved me.


[Verse 3] 
O, how I love God's Word, O, how I love God's Word, O, how I love God's Word; It tells of His love for me.


[Verse 4] 
There is a name I love to hear, I love to sing its worth; It sounds like music in my ear, The sweetest name on earth.


[Verse 5] 
It tells me of a Savior's love, Who died to set me free; It tells me of His precious blood, The sinner's perfect plea.


[Verse 6] 
It tells me what my Father hath, In store for ev'ry day; And tho' I tread a darksome path, Yields sunshine all the way.


[Verse 7] 
It tells of One whose loving heart, Can feel my deepest woe; Who in each sorrow bears a part, That none can bear below.
