[Verse 1] 
Who is like you Lord in all the earth? Matchless love and beauty, endless worth Nothing in this world can satisfy 'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry


[Verse 2] 
Your presence is heaven to me Your presence is heaven to me


[Verse 3] 
Oh Jesus , Oh Jesus Your presence is heaven to me Oh Jesus , Oh Jesus Your presence is heaven to me


[Verse 4] 
Treasure of my heart and of my soul In my weakness You were merciful Redeemer of my past and present wrongs Holder of my future days to come


[Verse 5] 
There's joy in your presense There's peace in your presense There's hope in your presense That's where I want to be


[Verse 6] 
Your presence is heaven to me Your presence is heaven to me


[Verse 7] 
Oh Jesus , Oh Jesus Your presence is heaven to me Oh Jesus , Oh Jesus Your presence is heaven to me


[Verse 8] 
All my days on earth I will await The moment that I see You face to face Nothing in this world can satisfy 'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry 'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry You never run dry


[Verse 9] 
Your presence is heaven to me Your presence is heaven to me Lord your presence is heaven to me Your presence is heaven to me
