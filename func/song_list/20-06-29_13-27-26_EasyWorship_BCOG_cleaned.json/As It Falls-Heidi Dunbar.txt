[Verse 1] 
I'm insecure, I'm broken Got my feet planted firm on the ground But I just keep on falling down I'm fighting, depression Cause I know that's not what I'm called to be But the feeling keeps on trapping me


[Verse 2] 
I've given up, I've shut down My world has turned upside down But it won't get the best of me I refused to be ignored


[Verse 3] 
Down on my knees, I cry Tears on my pillow case, I fight Oh, the thunder and lightening have got me down But Your rain will wash away all my pain from yesterday As it falls, as it falls


[Verse 4] 
God my savior, my redeemer It feels as if the enemy has bound me for all eternity Lord of Lords and King of Kings I feel like I can't go on, please help me to be strong


[Verse 5] 
I've given up, I've shut down The world is trying to keep me earth bound But I won't let it get me down For I know who I am


[Verse 6] 
Down on my knees, I cry Tears on my pillow case, I fight Oh, the thunder and lightening have got me down But Your rain will wash away all my pain from yesterday As it falls, as it falls


[Verse 7] 
I know that I'm gonna make it, That You will bring me through Every chain that binds me, In the name of Jesus become loose I am set free, by His grace and mercy I receive my victory, down on my knees


[Verse 8] 
Down on my knees, I cry Tears on my pillow case, I fight Oh, the thunder and lightening have got me down But Your rain will wash away all my pain from yesterday As it falls, as it falls
