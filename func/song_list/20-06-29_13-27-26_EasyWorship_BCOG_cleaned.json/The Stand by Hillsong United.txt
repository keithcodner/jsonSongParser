[Verse 1] 
You stood before creation Eternity in your hand You spoke the earth into motion My soul now to stand


[Verse 2] 
You stood before my failure And carried the cross for my shame My sin weighed upon your shoulders My soul now to stand


[Verse 3] 
So what could I say? And what could I do? But offer this heart, Oh God Completely to you


[Verse 4] 
So I'll walk upon salvation Your spirit alive in me This life to declare your promise My soul now to stand


[Verse 5] 
So what could I say? And what could I do? But offer this heart, Oh God Completely to you


[Verse 6] 
I'll stand With arms high and heart abandoned In awe of the one who gave it all I'll stand My soul Lord to you surrendered All I am is yours
