[Verse 1] 
Bless the Lord oh my soul Oh my soul Worship his Holy name Sing like never before Oh my soul I'll worship your Holy name


[Verse 2] 
The sun comes up It's a new day dawning It's time to sing your song again Whatever may pass And whatever lies before me Let me be singing When the evening comes


[Verse 3] 
Bless the Lord oh my soul Oh my soul Worship his Holy name Sing like never before Oh my soul I'll worship your Holy name


[Verse 4] 
You're rich in love And you're slow to anger Your name is great And your heart is kind For all your goodness I will keep on singing Ten thousand reasons For my heart to find


[Verse 5] 
Bless the Lord oh my soul Oh my soul Worship his Holy name Sing like never before Oh my soul I'll worship your Holy name


[Verse 6] 
And on that day When my strength is failing The end draws near And my time has come Still my soul will Sing your praise unending Ten thousand years and then forevermore


[Verse 7] 
Bless the Lord oh my soul Oh my soul Worship his Holy name Sing like never before Oh my soul I'll worship your Holy name


[Verse 8] 
Sing like never before Oh my soul I'll worship your Holy name Jesus I will worship your Holy name Worship your holy name
