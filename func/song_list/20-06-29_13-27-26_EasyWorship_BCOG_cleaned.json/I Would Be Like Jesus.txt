[Verse 1] 
Be like Jesus, this my song, In the home and in the throng; Be like Jesus, all day long! I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
Earthly pleasures vainly call me; I would be like Jesus; Nothing worldly shall enthrall me; I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
He has broken ev'ry fetter, I would be like Jesus; That my soul may serve Him better, I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
All the way from earth to glory, I would be like Jesus; Telling o'er and o'er the story, I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
That in heaven He may meet me, I would be like Jesus; That His words "Well done," may greet me, I would be like Jesus.
