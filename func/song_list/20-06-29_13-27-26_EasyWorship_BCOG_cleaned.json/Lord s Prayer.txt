[Verse 1] 
Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.


[Verse 2] 
Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses As we forgive those Who trespass against us.


[Verse 3] 
And lead us not into temptation, But deliver from evil, For thine is the kingdom, And the power and the glory forever. Amen.
