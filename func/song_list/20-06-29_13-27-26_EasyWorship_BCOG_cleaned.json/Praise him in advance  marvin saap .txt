[Verse 1] 
Ive had my share of ups and downs, times when there was no one around God came and spoke to me, praise will confuse the enemy (x2)


[Verse 2] 
I started singing,i started clapping, I started dancing People were laughing they knew my problems, they knew my pain, But I knew God would take them away


[Verse 3] 
That's why i praise him with my hands, that's why i praise him with a dance, He's given me a second chance, come on let's praise him in advance.


[Verse 4] 
That's why I praise him with a song, when things are right and when they're wrong, he's given me a second chance, come on let's praise him in advance.


[Verse 5] 
Praise him (Praise him) x6 All my life (I will) praise him when i'm wrong (I will) praise him praise him in advance.


[Verse 6] 
Oh-ho (Oh-ho) Oh-ho (Oh-ho) Oh-ho (Oh-ho) Oh- woah (Oh-ho) Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Come on and) Praise Him in advance
