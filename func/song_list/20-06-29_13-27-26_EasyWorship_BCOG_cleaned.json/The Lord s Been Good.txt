[Verse 1] 
The Lord's been good The Lord's been good The Lord's been good to me How can I let Him down How can I let Him down How can I let Him down The Lord's been good to me


[Verse 2] 
He saved my soul He made me whole he saved my soul from hell How can I let Him down How can I let Him down How can I let Him down The Lord's been good to me


[Verse 3] 
He picked me up He turned me up He plant my feet on higher ground How can I let Him down How can I let Him down How can I let Him down The Lord's been good to me
