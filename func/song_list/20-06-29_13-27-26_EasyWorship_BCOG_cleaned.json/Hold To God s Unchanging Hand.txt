[Verse 1] 
Time is filled with swift transition Naught of earth unmoved may bring Build your hopes on things eternal Hold to God's unchanging hand


[Verse 2] 
Hold to God's unchanging hand Hold to God's unchanging hand Build you hopes on things eternal Hold to God's unchanging hand


[Verse 3] 
Trust in Him who will not leave you Whatsoever years may bring If by earthly friends forsaken Still more closely to Him cling


[Verse 4] 
Covet not this world's vain riches That so rapidly decay Seek to gain the heav'nly treasures They will never pass away


[Verse 5] 
When your journey is completed If to God you have been true Fair and bright the home in glory Your enraptured soul will view
