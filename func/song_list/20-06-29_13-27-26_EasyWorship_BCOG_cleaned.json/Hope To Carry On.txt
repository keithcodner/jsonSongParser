[Verse 1] 
Love has come Love has come Love has come And it's given me hope to carry on


[Verse 2] 
I can see Jesus hanging on the cross I can see Jesus hanging on the cross I can see Jesus hanging on the cross He came looking for the lost


[Verse 3] 
I can hear Jesus saying Father forgive I can hear Jesus saying Father forgive I can hear Jesus saying Father forgive What a thing He did


[Verse 4] 
I can see love Love is all I want to see Love could make a beggar rich He could set prisoner free I know He could do it for you God knows He did it for me I can see love Love is all I want to show you Love love's the only way to go love Love is all a man might need to know This I know


[Verse 5] 
You know Peter put away his sword I can see Peter he's putting away his sword I can see Peter he put away his sword He won't fight no more
