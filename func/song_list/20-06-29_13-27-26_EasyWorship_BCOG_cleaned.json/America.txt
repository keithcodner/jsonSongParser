[Verse 1] 
My country, 'tis of Thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of Thee I sing: Land where my fathers died, Land of the pilgrims' pride, From every mountain side Let freedom ring!


[Verse 2] 
My native country, thee, Land of the noble, free, Thy name I love: I love Thy rocks and rills, Thy woods and templed hill; My heart with rapture thrills Like that above.


[Verse 3] 
Let music swell the breeze, And ring from all the trees Sweet freedom's song: Let mortal tongues awake; Let all that breathe partake; Let rocks their silence break, The sound prolong.


[Verse 4] 
Our fathers' God, to Thee, Author of liberty, To Thee we sing: Long may our land be bright With freedom's holy light; Protect us by Thy might, Great God, our King!
