[Verse 1] 
He is Jealous for me Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy


[Verse 2] 
All of a sudden I'm unaware Of these afflictions eclipsed by glory And I realize just how beautiful You are and How great your affections are for me


[Verse 3] 
And oh, how He loves us so Oh, how He loves is How he loves us so And oh, how He loves us so Oh, how He loves is How he loves us so


[Verse 4] 
We are His portion and He is our prize Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking


[Verse 5] 
So, Heaven meets Earth like sloppy wet kiss And my heart turns violently inside of my chest And I don't have time to maintain my regrets When I think about the way


[Verse 6] 
He loves us Oh, how He loves us Oh, how He loves us Oh, how He loves


[Verse 7] 
He loves me Oh, how He loves me Oh, how He loves me Oh, how He loves
