[Verse 1] 
Holy my God You are worthy Of all my praise Holy my God You are worthy Of all my praise


[Verse 2] 
I will follow You through green pastures And sing hallelujah to Your name I will follow You through dark disaster And sing hallelujah through the pain And even in the shadow of death I will praise You And even in the valley I will say


[Verse 3] 
You are seated on Your throne in heaven And You see all of us down here And You have promised You will not abandon So I shall not fear And even in the shadow of death I will praise You And even in the valley I will say


[Verse 4] 
You made ev'ry star And You taught it how to shine You knew my name before there was time And all this was just part of Your glorious design Hallelujah Hallelujah
