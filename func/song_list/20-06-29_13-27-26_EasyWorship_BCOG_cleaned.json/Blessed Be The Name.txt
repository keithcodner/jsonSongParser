[Verse 1] 
Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name of the Lord; Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name, Blessed be the name of the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
All praise to Him who reigns above, In majesty supreme Who gave His Son for man to die, That He might man redeem!


[Verse 3] 
His name above all names shall stand, Exalted more and more, At God the Father's own right hand, Where angel hosts adore.


[Verse 4] 
Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man, Once ruined by the fall, Thou hast devised salvation's plan, For Thou hast died for all.


[Verse 5] 
His name shall be the Counselor, The mighty Prince of Peace, Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror, Whose reign shall never cease.
