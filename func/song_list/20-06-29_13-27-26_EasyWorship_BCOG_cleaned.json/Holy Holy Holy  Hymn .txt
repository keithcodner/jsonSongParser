[Verse 1] 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning My song shall rise to Thee. Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty! God in three Persons, Blessed Trinity!


[Verse 2] 
Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee, Casting down their golden crowns Around the glassy sea; Cherubim and seraphim Falling down before Thee, Which wert, and art, And evermore shall be.


[Verse 3] 
Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee, Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see. Only Thou art holy; There is none beside Thee Perfect in power, In love, in purity.


[Verse 4] 
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! All Thy works shall praise Thy name In earth, and sky, and sea. Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty! God in three Persons, Blessed Trinity.
