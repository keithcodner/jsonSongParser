[Verse 1] 
You call me out upon the water The great unknnown where feet may fail And there i find you in the mystery In oceans deep My faith will stand


[Verse 2] 
And I will call upon Your name And keep my eyes above the waves When oceans rise My soul will rest in Your embrace For I am Yours and You are mine


[Verse 3] 
Your grace abounds in deepest waters Your sovereign hand Will be my guide Where feet may fail and fear surround me You've never failed and You won't start now


[Verse 4] 
So I will call upon your name And keep my eyes above the waves When oceans rise My soul will rest in Your embrace For I am Yours and You are mine


[Verse 5] 
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders Let me walk upon the waters Wherever You would call me Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander And my faith will be made stronger In the presence of my Savior


[Verse 6] 
Yeah Oh Jesus yeah, my God


[Verse 7] 
I will call upon Your Name keep my eyes above the waves My soul will rest in Your embrace I am Yours and You are mine.
