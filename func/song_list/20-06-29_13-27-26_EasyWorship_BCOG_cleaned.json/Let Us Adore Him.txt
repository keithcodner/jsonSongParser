[Verse 1] 
The heavens declare The glory of God And all of the world Will join the praise His wonders proclaim


[Verse 2] 
The oceans and skies Lift up their voice And all He has made Will rise to bless The King of all kings.


[Verse 3] 
Let us adore Him Let us adore Him Jesus Christ is the Lord Come and behold Him Bow down before Him Jesus Christ is the Lord


[Verse 4] 
Eternity's King Is coming again Though all of the earth Will fade away His truth will remain


[Verse 5] 
Hallelujah Hallelujah You are worthy of all praise


[Verse 6] 
End Jesus Christ is the Lord
