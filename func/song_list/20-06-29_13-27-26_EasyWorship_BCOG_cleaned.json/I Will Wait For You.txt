[Verse 1] 
I will wait for You Jesus You're the sun in my horizon All my hope's in You Jesus I can see You now arising I can see You now arising


[Verse 2] 
There's a wall thats standing in front of me A wall I just cannot climb Like an eagle You will carry me Just a matter of time


[Verse 3] 
There's an eagle in the horizon I know the wall that's in front of me But I believe in the Word You promised me So I will wait another day. Wait another day
