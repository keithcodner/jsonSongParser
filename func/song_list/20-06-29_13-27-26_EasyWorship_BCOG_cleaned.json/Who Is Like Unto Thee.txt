[Verse 1] 
The man of war the Lord of host are You Thy right hand oh God is glorious in power You have dashed the enemy in pieces Triumphed gloriously over death You reign in majesty


[Verse 2] 
Who is like unto thee oh Lord? Among the gods who is like unto thee Glorious in holiness Fearful in praises doing wonders Who is like unto thee?


[Verse 3] 
There is no one like our God None like Jehovah
