[Verse 1] 
In the cross of Christ I glory, Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time; All the light of sacred story Gathers round its head sublime.


[Verse 2] 
When the woes of life o'ertake me, Hopes deceive and fears annoy; Never shall the cross forsake me, Lo! it glows with peace and joy.


[Verse 3] 
When the sun of bliss is beaming Light and love upon my way; From the cross the radiance streaming Adds more luster to the day.


[Verse 4] 
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure, By the cross are sanctified; Peace is there that knows no measure, Joys that thro' all time abide.
