[Verse 1] 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, Born is the King of Israel.


[Verse 2] 
The first Noel, The angel did say, Was to certain poor shepherds, In fields as they lay; In fields where they Lay keeping their sheep, On a cold winter's night That was so deep.


[Verse 3] 
They looked up and saw a star Shining in the east, Beyond them far, And to the earth It gave great light, And so it continued Both day and night.


[Verse 4] 
And by the light Of that same star, Three wise men came From country far; To seek for a King Was their intent, And to follow the star, Wherever it went.


[Verse 5] 
This star drew nigh To the northwest, O'er Bethlehem It took its rest, And there it did Both stop and stay, Right over the place Where Jesus lay.


[Verse 6] 
Then entered in Those wise men three, Full rev'rently Upon their knee, And offered there In His presence, Their gold, and myrrh, And frankincense.


[Verse 7] 
Then let us all With one accord, Sing praises to Our heavenly Lord, That hath made heav'n And earth of naught, And with His blood Mankind hath bought.
