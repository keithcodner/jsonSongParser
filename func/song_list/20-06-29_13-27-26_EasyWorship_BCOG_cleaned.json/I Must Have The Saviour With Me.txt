[Verse 1] 
I must have the saviour with me For I dare not walk alone I must feel His presence near me And His arms around me thrown


[Verse 2] 
Then my soul shall fear no ill Let Him lead me where He will I will go without a murmur And His footsteps follow still


[Verse 3] 
I must have the saviour with me For my faith at best is weak He can whisper words of comfort That no other voice can speak


[Verse 4] 
I must have the saviour with me In the onward march of life Through the tempest and the sunshine Through the battle and the strife


[Verse 5] 
I must have the saviour with me And His eyes the way must guide 'til I reach the veil of Jordan 'til I cross the rolling tide
