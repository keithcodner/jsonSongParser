[Verse 1] 
Would you be free from the burden of sin? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; Would you o'er evil a victory win? There's wonder-working power in the blood.


[Verse 2] 
There is power power Wonder working power In the blood Of the Lamb There is power power Wonder working power In the precious blood of the Lamb


[Verse 3] 
Would you be free from your passion and pride? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide There's wonder-working power in the blood.


[Verse 4] 
Would you be whiter much whiter than snow? There's power in the blood power in the blood; Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow There's wonder-working power in the blood.


[Verse 5] 
Would you do service for Jesus your King? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; Would you live daily His praises to sing? There's wonder-working power in the blood.
