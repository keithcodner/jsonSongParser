[Verse 1] 
From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes, There is a calm, a sure retreat: 'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.


[Verse 2] 
There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads, A place than all beside more sweet: It is the Blood-bought mercy seat.


[Verse 3] 
There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend. Though sundered far by faith they meet Around the common mercy seat.


[Verse 4] 
Ah whither could we flee for aid, When tempted desolate dismayed, Or how the hosts of hell defeat, Had suff'ring saints no mercy seat.


[Verse 5] 
Ah there on eagle wings we soar, And sin an sense molest no more; And heav'n comes down our souls to greet, While glory crowns the mercy seat.
