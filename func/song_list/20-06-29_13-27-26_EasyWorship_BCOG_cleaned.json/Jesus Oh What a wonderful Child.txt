[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Jesus Oh what a wonderful child Jesus, Jesus So lowly meek and mild New life, new hope, new joy He brings Won't you listen to the angels sing Glory, glory, glory To the new born King


[Verse 2] 
He was herald by the angels Born in a lowly manger The virgin Mary was His mother And Joseph was his earthly father Three wise men came from afar They were guided by a shining star To see King Jesus where He lay In a manger filled with hay


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, Jesus Oh what a wonderful child Jesus, Jesus So lowly meek and mild New life, new hope, new joy He brings Won't you listen to the angels sing Glory,â€¦mil
