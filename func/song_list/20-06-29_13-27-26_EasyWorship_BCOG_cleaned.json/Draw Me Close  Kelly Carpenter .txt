[Verse 1] 
Draw me close to You Never let me go I lay it all down again To hear You say that I'm Your friend


[Verse 2] 
You are my desire No one else will do No one else can take Your place To feel the warmth of Your embrace Help me find a way Bring me back to You


[Verse 3] 
You're all I want You're all I ever needed You're all I want Help me know You are near
