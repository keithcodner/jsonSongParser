[Verse 1] 
Lead me Lord I will follow Lead me Lord I will go You have called me I will answer Lead me Lord I will go


[Verse 2] 
It's hard to take the first step When I don't know the way Each turn is so uncertain I learn to walk by faith But You gave me a promise That You would never leave You will lead and guide me Oh Lord I do believe


[Verse 3] 
Your plans for me are perfect I never need to fear For though at times I feel alone I know that You are near My heart just wants to follow I'm willing to obey Take my hand and lead me I'll follow all the way


[Verse 4] 
You have called me I will answer Lead me Lord I will go You have called me I will answer Lead me Lord Lord I will go Lead me Lord
