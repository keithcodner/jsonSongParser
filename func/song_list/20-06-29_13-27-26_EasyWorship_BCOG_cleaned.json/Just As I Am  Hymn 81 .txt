[Verse 1] 
Just as I am without one plea But as Thy blood was shed for me And as Thou bidst me come to Thee O Lamb, of God I come I Come


[Verse 2] 
Just as I am and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot O Lamb, of God I come I Come


[Verse 3] 
Just as I am Thou wilt receive Wilt welcome pardon, cleanse, relieve Because Thy promise I believe O Lamb, of God I come I come
