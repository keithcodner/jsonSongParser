[Verse 1] 
Oh Lord you've searched me You know my way Even when i fail you I know you love me


[Verse 2] 
Your holy presence Surrounding me In every season I know you love me I know you love me


[Verse 3] 
At the cross I bow my knee Where your blood was shed for me There's no greater love than this You have overcome the grave Your glory fills the highest place What can separate me now


[Verse 4] 
You go before me You shield my way Your hand upholds me I know you love me


[Verse 5] 
At the cross I bow my knee Where your blood was shed for me There's no greater love than this You have overcome the grave Your glory fills the highest place What can separate me now


[Verse 6] 
You tore the veil You made a way When you said that it is done


[Verse 7] 
And when the earth fades Falls from my eyes And you stand before me I know you love me I know you love me


[Verse 8] 
At the cross I bow my knee Where your blood was shed for me There's no greater love than this You have overcome the grave Your glory fills the highest place What can separate me now
