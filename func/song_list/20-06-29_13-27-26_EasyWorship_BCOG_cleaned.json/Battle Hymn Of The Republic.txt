[Verse 1] 
Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! His truth is marching on.


[Verse 2] 
Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Our God is marching on.


[Verse 3] 
Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning Of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on.


[Verse 4] 
I have seen Him in the watchfires Of a hundred circling camps; They have builded Him an altar In the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence By the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on.


[Verse 5] 
He has sounded forth the trumpet That shall never sound retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men Before His judgment seat; O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on.


[Verse 6] 
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom That transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, Let us live to make men free, While God is marching on.


[Verse 7] 
Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord; It is flowing through the cities And the waste will be restored; By the leading of the Spirit And their trusting in His Word, His army marches on.


[Verse 8] 
Arise and shine my people, See the glory of the Lord; As the church with signs and wonders Marches on in one accord; His soldiers do not falter As for Him they wield the sword, His army marches on.


[Verse 9] 
O join this mighty army There's a battle to be won; Let us now put in sickle For the harvest time has come; Countless multitudes are waiting Just to hear of God's own Son, His army marches on.
