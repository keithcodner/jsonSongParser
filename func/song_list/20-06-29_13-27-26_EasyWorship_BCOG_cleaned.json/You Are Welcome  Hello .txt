[Verse 1] 
Who am I that You would come and see me I'm overwhelmed can't catch my breath Can hardly breathe


[Verse 2] 
We're excited Can't sit down We feel Your Spirit all around We're expecting A fresh anointing to fill This place right now


[Verse 3] 
Hello Hello


[Verse 4] 
You are welcome You are welcome In this place oh God


[Verse 5] 
We can't hold back So glad You're here We feel Your love in the atmosphere
