[Verse 1] 
What does the cross of Jesus mean? It's more than songs we sing, yeah much more than that emblem on your chain But it mean I'm free, yes from the chain of slavery And the blood that shed won't let my sins remain, oh my


[Verse 2] 
Upon the cross my Saviour died, the Lamb was crucified Showed us love that this world had never known Oh what love, divine so divine, truer love you'll never find So that we might live, love came and died alone, Hallelujah


[Verse 3] 
Well the cross will always represent the love God had for me When the Lord of glory, Heaven sent gave all on calvary just for me, just for me Jesus came and did it just for me


[Verse 4] 
just for me, just for me Jesus came and did it just for me
