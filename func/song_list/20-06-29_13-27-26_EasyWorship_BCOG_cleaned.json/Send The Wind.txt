[Verse 1] 
I need revival, I need repentance I need a new start, I need a brand new heart More of You, I need more of You


[Verse 2] 
Send the wind, send the wind send the fire once again Let it fall down on us here as we lift up holy hands Send the wind, send the wind send the fire once again Everything in us will change as our hearts you innovate


[Verse 3] 
I need passion, I need purpose I need forgiveness, I need courageous faith More of You, I need more of You
