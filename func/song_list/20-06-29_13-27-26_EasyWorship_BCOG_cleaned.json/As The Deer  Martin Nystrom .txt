[Verse 1] 
As the deer panteth for the water So my soul longeth after thee You alone are my heart's desire And I long to worship thee


[Verse 2] 
You alone are my strength my shield To you alone make my spirit yield You alone are my heart's desire And I long to worship thee


[Verse 3] 
You're my friend And You are my brother Even though You are a King I love You more than any other So much more than anything


[Verse 4] 
I want You more than gold or silver Only You can satisfy You alone are the real joygiver And the apple of my eye
