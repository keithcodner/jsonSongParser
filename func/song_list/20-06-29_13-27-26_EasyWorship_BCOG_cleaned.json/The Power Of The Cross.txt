[Verse 1] 
A lonely hill A rugged tree Time stands still and waits for my answer This sacrifice is calling me to a life Of total surrender


[Verse 2] 
The power of the cross is moving in my life 'Cause the power of Your blood has saved me The power of the cross still draws me to Your side 'Cause the power of Your love has changed me Oh let my life be lost in the power of the cross


[Verse 3] 
Lord most high Hope of man You are my Redeemer and Savior All my days are in Your hand All my praise will be Yours forever


[Verse 4] 
Where mercy was great and grace was free Where pardon was multiplied to me Where my burdened soul found liberty Hide me in the power of the cross
