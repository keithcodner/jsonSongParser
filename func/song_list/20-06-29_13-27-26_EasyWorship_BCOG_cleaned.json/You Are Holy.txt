[Verse 1] 
O Lord, God of my salvation, Turn Your ear to me My God, Sovereign of all creation, I have come to give you praise And with the life Youâ€™ve given me I lift up my voice and sing


[Verse 2] 
You are Holy, You are Holy My lips pour out Your deserving praise You are Holy, The One and Only God King of Glory, Father of Grace


[Verse 3] 
Oh Lord, You clothe my heart in beauty with the blood of Calvary Now Your love, Your life, Your Holy Presence has become the air I breathe You are the joy of the redeemed The hope and the life, we sing
