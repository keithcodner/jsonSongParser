[Verse 1] 
Holy Lamb Who died for love Holy Spirit Here with us We are humbled On our knees Lord here we are Surrendering


[Verse 2] 
The redeemer is here And the moment is now His love for us is real With one voice, we cry out Loud and clear The Redeemer is here


[Verse 3] 
You are the risen one You are emmanuel With your grace and forgiveness Heal us Lord Jesus We cry out


[Verse 4] 
The redeemer is here/ You are the risen one And the moment is now/ You are emmanuel His love for us is real/ With your grace and forgiveness With one voice, we cry out/ Heal us Lord Jesus We cry out


[Verse 5] 
The redeemer is here/ You are the risen one And the moment is now/ You are emmanuel His love for us is real/ With your grace and forgiveness With one voice, we cry out/ Heal us Lord Jesus We cry out Loud and clear The Redeemer is here
