[Verse 1] 
Lord if I Find favor in Your sight Lord please Hear my hearts cry I'm desperately waiting To be where You are I'll cross the hottest desert I'll travel near or far


[Verse 2] 
For Your glory I will do anything Just to see You To behold You as my King


[Verse 3] 
Send the winds of refreshing God send your Spirit Send the winds of refreshing God send your Glory down
