[Verse 1] 
Blessed be your name In the land that is plentiful Where the streams of abundance flow Blessed be your name


[Verse 2] 
Blessed be your name When I'm found in the desert place Though I walk through the wilderness Blessed be your name


[Verse 3] 
Every blessing you pour out I turn back to praise When the darkness closes in, Lord Still will I say


[Verse 4] 
Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be your name Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be your glorious name


[Verse 5] 
Blessed be your name When the sun's shining down on me When the world's all as it should be Blessed be your name


[Verse 6] 
Blessed be your name On the road marked with suffering Through there's pain in the offering Blessed be your name


[Verse 7] 
You give and you take away You give and you take away My heart will choose to say Lord, Blessed be your name
