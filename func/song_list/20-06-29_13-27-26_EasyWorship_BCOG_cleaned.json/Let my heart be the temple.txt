[Verse 1] 
Let my heart be the temple of your spirit Let my spirit by the warmth of your embrace Let me be a holy habitation Where your Spirit is pleased to dwell


[Verse 2] 
Oh Lord I long to know your glory I want to offer the sacrifice of praise Fill this temple Lord With your Spirit once again
