[Verse 1] 
There is none like You, No one else can touch my heart like You do, I can search for all eternity Lord And find, there is none like You


[Verse 2] 
Your mercy flows like a river wide, And healing comes from Your hand Suffering children are safe in Your arms, There is none like You


[Verse 3] 
I can search for all eternity Lord, There is none like You I can search for all eternity Lord, There is none, There is none Lord, There is none like You
