[Verse 1] 
Come, Thou fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace. Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above. Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it, Mount of God's unchanging love.


[Verse 2] 
Here I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I come. And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger Wand'ring from the fold of God; He, to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, to grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be! Let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter, Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee: Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love. Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.


[Verse 4] 
Hither to Thy love has blest me; Thou hast bro't me to this place; And I know Thy hand will bring me Safely home by Thy good grace. Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God; He, to rescue me from danger, Bought me with His precious blood.
