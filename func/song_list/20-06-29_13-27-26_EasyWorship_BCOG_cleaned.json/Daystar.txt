[Verse 1] 
Lily of the valley, let your sweet aroma fill my life Rose of Sharon show me how to grow in beauty in God's sight Fairest of ten thousand make me a reflection of your light Daystar shine down on me let your love shine through me in the night


[Verse 2] 
Lead me lord, I'll follow Anywhere you open up the door Let me know your wisdom, show me things I've never seen before Lord I want to be your witness, you can take what's wrong and make it right Daystar shine down on me let your love shine through me in the night


[Verse 3] 
Lord I've seen a world that's dying wounded by the mast of deceit Groping in the darkness, haunted by the years of past defeat But when i see you standing near me shining with compassion in your eyes I pray Jesus Sine down on me let your love shine through me in the night


[Verse 4] 
Lead me lord, I'll follow Anywhere you open up the door Let me know your wisdom, show me things I've never seen before Lord I want to be your witness, you can take what's wrong and make it right Daystar shine down on me let your love shine through me in the night
