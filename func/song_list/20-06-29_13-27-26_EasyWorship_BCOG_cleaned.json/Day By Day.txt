[Verse 1] 
Day by day and with each passing moment, Strength I find to meet my trials here; Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment, I've no cause for worry or for fear. He whose heart is kind beyond all measure, Give unto each day what He deems best; Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, Mingling toil with peace and rest.


[Verse 2] 
Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me With a special mercy for each hour; All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me, He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r. The protection of His child and treasure, Is a charge that on Himself He laid; "As your days, your strength shall be in measure," This the pledge to me He made.


[Verse 3] 
Help me then in ev'ry tribulation, So to trust Your promises, O Lord; That I lose not faith's sweet consolation, Offered me within Your holy Word. Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting, E'er to take, as from a Father's hand, One by one, the days, the moments fleeting, Till I reach the promised land.
