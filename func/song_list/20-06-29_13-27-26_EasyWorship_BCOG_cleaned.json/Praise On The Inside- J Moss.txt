[Verse 1] 
There's a praise on the inside That I can't keep to myself A holler stirring up From the depths of my soul


[Verse 2] 
So excuse me if I seem a little giddy Or maybe even strange But praise is the way I say thanks


[Verse 3] 
There's a praise on the inside That I can't keep to myself A holler stirring up From the depths of my soul


[Verse 4] 
So excuse me if I seem a little giddy Or maybe even strange Praise is the way I say thanks


[Verse 5] 
Let it bring forth the sound From your heart, filled with gladness All ye lands make a joyful noise Let the songs of David live forever Because praise is the way I say thanks


[Verse 6] 
Praise is the way we say thanks There's a praise on the inside That I can't keep to myself A holler stirring up From the depths of my soul


[Verse 7] 
So excuse me if I seem a little giddy Or maybe even strange But praise is the way I say thanks (repeat)


[Verse 8] 
There's a praise on the inside I can't keep to myself A holler from the gut...
