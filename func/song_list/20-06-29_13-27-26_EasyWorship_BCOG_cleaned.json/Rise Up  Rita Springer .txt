[Verse 1] 
I am blessed among the people I am blessed among the nations I am blessed because I am loved by You


[Verse 2] 
I am loved and highly favoured Saved by the grace of the Mighty Saviour I am blessed because I am loved by You


[Verse 3] 
No weapon formed against me shall prosper No curse can ever take it's promise from me When hope is gone and the darkness has fallen I will still believe, I'll still believe


[Verse 4] 
I'm gonna rise up I'm gonna rise up I'm gonna rise up and call myself blessed
