[Verse 1] 
Who can stand against the Lord No one can, No one will. Who can stand against the King No one can, No one will.


[Verse 2] 
ohhh, ohhh Victory belongs to Jesus Victory belongs to Him


[Verse 3] 
We put out trust in You We put out hope in You


[Verse 4] 
You will deliver, you're a provider I find my victory in You Forever victorious, forever we win I find my victory in You


[Verse 5] 
Victory belongs to Jesus Victory belongs to Him
