[Verse 1] 
I have made You too small in my eyes Oh Lord forgive me And I have believed in a lie That You were unable to help me But now


[Verse 2] 
Oh Lord, I see my wrong Heal my heart and show Yourself strong And with my eyes and in my song Oh Lord Be magnified Oh Lord Be magnified


[Verse 3] 
Be magnified Oh Lord You are highly exalted And there is nothing You can't do Oh Lord my eyes are on You Be magnified Oh Lord Be magnified
