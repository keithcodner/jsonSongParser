[Verse 1] 
Can i tell you what his done for me I gotta give him all the glory see he brought me from a mighty long way When i thought he never loved me He saved me from death and sin From the hands of the enemy So when i think about his goodness, I gotta lift my hands and shout to him Praise him


[Verse 2] 
Praise Him (3 times) Praise him the morning, Praise him the evening Praise Him (3 times) Praise him in the church And all day long


[Verse 3] 
When i look at the world today Am so happy and thankful Cause his angels are watching me So i gotta be grateful He saved me from drugs and weed From the gangs and the shooting See am a living testimony For how great my God is, If you know he's been good to you, Why don't you stand and say with me Praise Him


[Verse 4] 
He's the lord God almighty He's mighty in battle Give him all the praise cause i gotta be thankful People watching me cause am dancing like David Don't judge me if you don't know my King I praise him in my room And i praise him in my school Parise him on the streets And i praise cause its cool Praise cause i love him so much If you love him too then praise him with me Praise him
