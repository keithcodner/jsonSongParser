[Verse 1] 
I heard the bells on Christmas day, Their old familiar carols play; And wild and sweet the words repeat, Of peace on earth, good will to men.


[Verse 2] 
I thought how as the day had come, The belfries of all Christendom; Had rolled along the unbroken song, Of peace on earth, good will to men.


[Verse 3] 
And in despair I bowed my head, "There is no peace on earth," I said; "For hate is strong and mocks the song, Of peace on earth, good will to men."


[Verse 4] 
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep, "God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, With peace on earth, good will to men."


[Verse 5] 
Till ringing, singing on its way, The world revolved from night to day; A voice, a chime, a chant sublime Of peace on earth, good will to men.
