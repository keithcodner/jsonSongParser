[Verse 1] 
You don't have to worry And don't you be afraid Joy comes in the morning Troubles they don't last always


[Verse 2] 
For there's a friend named Jesus Who will wipe your tears away And if your heart is broken Just lift your hands and say


[Verse 3] 
I know that I can make it I know that I can stand No matter what comes my way My life is in Your hands With Jesus I can take it With Him I know I can stand No matter what may come my way My life is in Your hands


[Verse 4] 
So when your test and trials They seem to get you down And all your friends and loved ones Are no where to be found Remember there's a friend named Jesus Who will wipe your tears away And if your heart is broken Just lift your hands and say
