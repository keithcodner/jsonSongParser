[Verse 1] 
Faith of our fathers, living still In spite of dungeon, fire and sword! O how our hearts beat high with joy Whene'er we hear that glorious word! Faith of our fathers! Holy faith! We will be true to Thee till death!


[Verse 2] 
Our fathers, chained in prisons dark, Were still in heart and conscience free. How sweet would be their children's fate If they, like them could die for thee! Faith of our fathers! Holy faith! We will be true to Thee till death!


[Verse 3] 
Faith of our fathers! God's great power Shall win all nations unto thee; And through the truth that comes from God Mankind shall then be truly free. Faith of our fathers! Holy faith! We will be true to thee till death!


[Verse 4] 
Faith of our fathers we will love Both friend and foe in all our strife; And preach Thee, too, as love knows how, By kindly words and virtuous life. Faith of our fathers! Holy faith! We will be true to Thee till death!


[Verse 5] 
Faith of our fathers we will strive To win all nations unto Thee! And thro' the truth that comes from God Mankind shall then be truly free: Faith of our fathers! Holy faith! We will be true to Thee till death!
