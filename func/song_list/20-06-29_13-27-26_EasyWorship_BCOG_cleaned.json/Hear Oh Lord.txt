[Verse 1] 
Hear O Lord the sound of my call Hear O Lord and have mercy My soul is longing for the glory of you O hear O Lord and answer me


[Verse 2] 
Every night before I sleep I pray my soul to take Or else I pray that loneliness Is gone when I awake.


[Verse 3] 
Hear O Lord the sound of my call Hear O Lord and have mercy My soul is longing for the glory of you O hear O Lord and answer me


[Verse 4] 
Why do I no longer feel Like I've a place to stay? O take me where someone will care So fear will go away.


[Verse 5] 
Hear O Lord the sound of my call Hear O Lord and have mercy My soul is longing for the glory of you O hear O Lord and answer me


[Verse 6] 
In you Lord I place my cares And all my troubles too O grant, dear Lord, that some day soon I'll live in peace with you.


[Verse 7] 
Hear O Lord the sound of my call Hear O Lord and have mercy My soul is longing for the glory of you O hear O Lord and answer me
