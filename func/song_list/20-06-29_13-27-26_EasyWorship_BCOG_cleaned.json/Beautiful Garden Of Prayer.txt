[Verse 1] 
O the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer, O the beautiful garden of prayer. There my Savior awaits, and He opens the gates To the beautiful garden of prayer.


[Verse 2] 
There's a garden where Jesus is waiting, There's a place that is wondrously fair. For it glows with the light of His presence, 'Tis the beautiful garden of prayer.


[Verse 3] 
There's a garden where Jesus is waiting, And I go with my burden and care. Just to learn from His lips, words of comfort, In the beautiful garden of prayer.


[Verse 4] 
There's a garden where Jesus is waiting, And He bids you to come meet Him there, Just to bow and receive a new blessing, In the beautiful garden of prayer.
