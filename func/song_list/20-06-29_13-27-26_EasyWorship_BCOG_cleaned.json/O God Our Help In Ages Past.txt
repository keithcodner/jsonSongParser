[Verse 1] 
O God, our Help in ages past, Our Hope for years to come, Our Shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal Home!


[Verse 2] 
Under the shadow of Thy throne Still may we dwell secure; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defense is sure.


[Verse 3] 
Before the hills in order stood, Or earth received her frame, From everlasting Thou art God, To endless years the same.


[Verse 4] 
O God, our Help in ages past, Our Hope for years to come, Be Thou my Guide while life shall last, And our eternal Home.


[Verse 5] 
A thousand ages in Thy sight, Are like and evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night, Before the rising sun.


[Verse 6] 
Time like an ever rolling stream, Bears all its sons away; They fly, forgotten, as a dream Die at the op'ning day.
