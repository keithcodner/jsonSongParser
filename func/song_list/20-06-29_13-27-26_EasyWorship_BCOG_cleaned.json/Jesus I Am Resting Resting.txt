[Verse 1] 
Jesus I am resting resting In the joy of what Thou art I am finding out the greatness Of Thy loving heart


[Verse 2] 
Jesus I am resting resting In the joy of what Thou art I am finding out the greatness Of Thy loving heart Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee And Thy beauty fills my soul For by Thy transforming power Thou hast made me whole


[Verse 3] 
Oh how great Thy loving kindness Vaster broader than the sea Oh how marvelous Thy goodness Lavished all on me Yes I rest in Thee Beloved Know what wealth of grace is Thine Know Thy certainty of promise And have made it mine


[Verse 4] 
Simply trusting Thee Lord Jesus I behold Thee as Thou art And Thy love so pure so changeless Satisfies my heart Satisfies its deepest longings Meets supplies its ev'ry need Compasseth me 'round with blessings Thine is love indeed


[Verse 5] 
Ever lift Thy face upon me As I work and wait for Thee Resting 'neath Thy smile Lord Jesus Earth's dark shadows flee Brightness of my Father's glory Sunshine of my Father's face Keep me ever trusting resting Fill me with Thy grace
