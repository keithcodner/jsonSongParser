[Verse 1] 
When we all get to heaven, What a day of rejoicing that will be! When we all see Jesus, We'll sing and shout the victory.


[Verse 2] 
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, Sing His mercy and His grace; In the mansions bright and blessed, He'll prepare for us a place.


[Verse 3] 
While we walk the pilgrim pathway, Clouds will overspread the sky; But when traveling days are over, Not a shadow, not a sigh.


[Verse 4] 
Let us then be true and faithful, Trusting, serving every day; Just one glimpse of Him in glory Will the toils of life repay.


[Verse 5] 
Onward to the prize before us! Soon His beauty we'll behold; Soon the pearly gates will open, We shall tread the streets of gold.
