[Verse 1] 
Begin my tongue some heav'nly theme And speak some boundless thing; The mighty works or mightier name, Of our eternal King.


[Verse 2] 
Tell of His wondrous faithfulness And sound His pow'r abroad; Sing the sweet promise of His grace, The love and truth of God.


[Verse 3] 
His very word of grace is strong, As that which built the skies; The voice that roles the stars along, Speaks all the promises.


[Verse 4] 
O might I hear Thy heav'nly tongue, But whisper Thou art mine; Those gentle words shall raise my song, To notes almost divine.
