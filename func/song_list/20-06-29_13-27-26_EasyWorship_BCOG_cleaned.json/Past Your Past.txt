[Verse 1] 
Where'd it all start, she started I remember well A life of disappointment She just had to tell Her words were cold and bitter She grew angry fast I could tell she needed Jesus To get her past her past


[Verse 2] 
And you can get past your past You can walk away from painful memories You can get past your past You don't have to walk alone You can stand upon the Word of God Your yesterday's can be gone Let Jesus bring you past your past And then you can go on


[Verse 3] 
How can I get beyond it? I listened as she cried. She said I've moved away to start again And I've failed at all I've tried You see I blamed this man I know For the way I have to live How can I get beyond it all? I said you must forgive


[Verse 4] 
So if you are held captive By deeds of yesterday Regardless of how far you've run You don't think you can get away Run on a little farther To the Father's mercy throne There you can find a brand new start His heart will be your home.
