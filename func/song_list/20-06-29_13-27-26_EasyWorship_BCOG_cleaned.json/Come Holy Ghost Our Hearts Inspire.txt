[Verse 1] 
Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire; Let us Thine influence prove: Source of the old prophetic fire, Fountain of life and love.


[Verse 2] 
Come, Holy Ghost for moved by Thee The prophets wrote and spoke. Unlock the truth, Thyself the key; Unseal the Sacred Book.


[Verse 3] 
God, through Himself, we then shall know If Thou within us shine, And sound with all Thy saints below, The depths of love divine.
