[Verse 1] 
Mercy there was great and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty, At Calvary.


[Verse 2] 
Years I spent in vanity and pride, Caring not my Lord was crucified, Knowing not it was for me He died On Calvary.


[Verse 3] 
By God's Word at last my sin I learned; Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned, Till my guilty soul imploring turned To Calvary.


[Verse 4] 
Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything; Now I gladly own Him as my King; Now my raptured soul can only sing Of Calvary.


[Verse 5] 
O the love that drew salvation's plan! O the grace that brought it down to man! O the mighty gulf that God did span At Calvary!
