[Verse 1] 
I've got a river of living water A fountain that never will run dry It's open heaven you're releasing And we will never be denied


[Verse 2] 
Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells, We're stirring up deep deep waters We're gonna dance in the river, dance in the river Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells, We're stirring up deep deep waters We're gonna jump in the river Jump in the river


[Verse 3] 
Deep cries out to, deep cries out to you Deep cries out to, deep cries out to you We cry out to, we cry out to You Jesus


[Verse 4] 
We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to you We're walking into deeper waters, going after you


[Verse 5] 
If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left, If He goes to the right then we'll go to the right We're going jump jump, jump jump in the river Jump jump jump jump everybody


[Verse 6] 
If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left, If He goes to the right then we'll go to the right We're going to dance dance, dance dance in the river Dance dance, dance dance everybody We're going to shout shout, shout shout in the river Shout shout, shout shout everybody
