[Verse 1] 
Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon His throne. Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns All music but its own! Awake, my soul and sing Of Him who died for Thee; And hail Him as thy matchless King Through all eternity.


[Verse 2] 
Crown Him the Lord of love: Behold His hands and side, Rich wounds, yet visible above, In beauty glorified; No angel in the sky Can fully bear that sight, But downwards bends His wondering eye At mysteries so bright.


[Verse 3] 
Crown Him the Lord of life, Who triumphed o'er the grave. Who rose victorious to the strife, For those He came to save. His glories now we sing, Who died and rose on high. Who died eternal life to bring, And lives that death may die.


[Verse 4] 
Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose pow'r a scepter sways From pole to pole, That wars may cease And all be prayer and praise; His reign shall know no end, And round His pierced feet Fair flowers of paradise extend Their fragrance ever sweet.


[Verse 5] 
Crown Him the Lord of years, The Potentate of time; Creator of the rolling spheres, Ineffably sublime. All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me. Thy praise and glory shall not fail Throughout eternity.


[Verse 6] 
Crown Him the Son of God Before the worlds began, And ye, who tread where He hath trod, Crown Him the Son of man; Who every grief hath known That wrings the human breast, And takes and bears them for His own, That all in Him may rest.


[Verse 7] 
Crown Him the Lord of heaven: One with the Father known, One with the Spirit Through Him given From yonder glorious throne. All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me; Thy praise and glory shall not fail Throughout eternity.
