[Verse 1] 
Fill my cup Lord I lift it up Lord Come and quence this thirsting of my soul


[Verse 2] 
Bread of heaven Feed me 'till I want no more Fill my cup Fill it up And make me whole


[Verse 3] 
Fill my cup Fill it up And make me whole


[Verse 4] 
Like the woman at the well I was seeking For things that could not satisfy And then I heard my Savior speaking "Draw from My well that never shall run dry"


[Verse 5] 
There are millions in this world who are craving The pleasures earthly things afford; But none can match the wondrous treasure That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.
