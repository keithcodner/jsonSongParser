[Verse 1] 
Some through the waters, some through the flood Some through the fire, all through the blood Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song In the night season and all the day long


[Verse 2] 
In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet God leads His dear children along Where the water's cool flow bathes the weary one's feet God leads His dear children along


[Verse 3] 
Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright God leads His dear children along Sometimes in the valley, in the darkest night God leads His dear children along


[Verse 4] 
Though sorrows befall us and evils oppose God leads His dear children along Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes God leads His dear children along


[Verse 5] 
Away from the mire, and away from the clay, God leads His dear children along Away up in glory, eternity's day God leads His dear children along
