[Verse 1] 
Draw me near to where You are And lead me Lord direct my heart 'Cause I want to be Where You need me most Draw me bring me close


[Verse 2] 
I come before You God I toss my flesh aside So You can use me I strip my soul down bare Shout to You this prayer Please work through me


[Verse 3] 
Kick down all my walls Come with Your wrecking ball So I can see You Give me ears to hear Your voice so loud and clear Lord I need You
