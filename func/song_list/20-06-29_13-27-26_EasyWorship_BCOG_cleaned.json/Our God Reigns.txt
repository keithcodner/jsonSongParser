[Verse 1] 
How lovely on the mountains are the feet of him Who brings good news good news Announcing peace Proclaiming news of happiness Our God reigns Our God reigns


[Verse 2] 
Our God reigns Our God reigns Our God reigns Our God reigns


[Verse 3] 
He had no stately form, He had not majesty That we should be drawn to Him He was despised and we took no account of Him Yet now He reigns, with the most high


[Verse 4] 
Out of the tomb, He came with grace and majesty He is alive, He is alive God loves us so, see here his hands, His feet, His side Yes, we know, He is alive
