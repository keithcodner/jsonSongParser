[Verse 1] 
As I travel through this pilgrim land There is a friend who walks with me Leads me safely through the sinking sand It is the Christ of Calvary


[Verse 2] 
This would be my prayer dear Lord each day To help me do the best I can For I need thy light to guide me day and night Blessed Jesus hold my hand


[Verse 3] 
Jesus hold my hand I need thee every hour Through this pilgrim land Protect me by thy power


[Verse 4] 
Hear my feeble plea Oh Lord look down on me When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there Blessed Jesus hold my hand


[Verse 5] 
Let me travel in the light divine That I may see the blessed way Keep me that I may be wholly thine And sing redemption's song some day


[Verse 6] 
I will be a soldier brave and true And ever firmly take a stand As I onward go and daily meet the foe Blessed Jesus hold my hand
