[Verse 1] 
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds, In a believer's ear; It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds And drives away his fear.


[Verse 2] 
It makes the wounded Spirit whole And calms the troubled breast; 'Tis manna to the hungry soul And to the weary, rest.


[Verse 3] 
Dear name! the Rock on which I build, My shield and hiding place; My never failing treasure, Filled with boundless stores of grace.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, my Shepherd, Brother, Friend, My Prophet, Priest, and King My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, Accept the praise I bring.


[Verse 5] 
Weak is the effort of my heart And cold my warmest thought; But when I see Thee as Thou art, I'll praise Thee as I ought.


[Verse 6] 
Till then I would Thy love proclaim With ev'ry fleeting breath; And may the music of Thy name Refresh my soul in death.
