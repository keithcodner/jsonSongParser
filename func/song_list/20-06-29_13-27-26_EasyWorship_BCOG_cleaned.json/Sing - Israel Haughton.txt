[Verse 1] 
Now is the time for all people From ev'ry land to come together Now is the moment for worship We enter in withholding nothing


[Verse 2] 
Sing, sing unto the Lord Open up your heart Make a joyful noise in the sanctuary


[Verse 3] 
Sing, sing unto the Lord Lavish Him with love Let the praises ring In the sanctuary, sing


[Verse 4] 
Gotta open up your mouth and give Him praise Open up your heart and give Him praise Lift up holy hands unashamed Sing, sing, sing
