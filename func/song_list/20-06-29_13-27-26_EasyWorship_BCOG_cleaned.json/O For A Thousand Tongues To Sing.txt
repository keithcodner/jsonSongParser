[Verse 1] 
O for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeemer's praise, The glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace!


[Verse 2] 
My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim, To spread through all the earth abroad, The honors of Thy name.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus! The name that charms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease; 'Tis music in the sinner's ears; 'Tis life, and health, and peace.


[Verse 4] 
He breaks the power of canceled sin; He sets the prisoner free. His blood can make the foulest clean; His blood availed for me.


[Verse 5] 
Hear Him, ye deaf, His praise, ye dumb, Your loosened tongues employ. Ye blind, behold your Savior come, And leap ye lame for joy.


[Verse 6] 
Glory to God and praise and love Be ever, ever giv'n By saints below and saints above The church in earth and heav'n.
