[Verse 1] 
Let Your glory fall We are thirsty Lord Hear us as we call Fill us now Let Your glory fall Let Your glory fall Let Your glory fall


[Verse 2] 
Every tongue and tribe Gathered 'round Your throne With one voice we cry Holy Lord Every tongue and tribe Every tongue and tribe Every tongue and tribe


[Verse 3] 
Glory to the Lamb Lamb upon the throne All the saints proclaim Jesus reigns Jesus reigns Jesus reigns


[Verse 4] 
Glory to the Lamb Glory to the Lamb Glory to the Lamb
