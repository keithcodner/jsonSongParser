Just wanna make it to heaven I just wannna make it in I just wanna cross that riverI wanna be freee from sin Just want my name written (Oh Lord) Written in the lambs book of life When this life is over I just wanna have eternal life O wanna hear Him say


[Verse 2] 
Well done, well done, well done You can come on in Anbody wanna hear him say? Yeah (x2) Wave your hands where I can see 'em


[Verse 3] 
Anbody wanna see you loved ones That you've lost along the way I just wanna walk those streets of gold, yeah They say the half has never, never been told I don't want my singing Lord I don't want it, to be in vain


[Verse 4] 
I just wanna cross that river of God That's why I'm living, day to day, just to hear him say I wanna hear 'em say, stand up on your feet, church Anybody wanna hear him say, anybody out there? I wanna hear him say


[Verse 5] 
Wave you hands right there of the Lord I want you to close your eyes, don't loose your focus Your purpose for living in this life is to serve Jesus Christ And on the Day Of Judgement where it's all over He'll say come on lift your hands and wroship


[Verse 6] 
Yeah I feel the anointing of God right now, I feel the presence of the Lord right now

If you wanna hear the Lord say well done I want you to scream Anybody wanna hear him say? (x2) Hear Him say I wanna hear Him say I wanna hear Him say Yeah yeah yeah You can come on in my son Your can come on in my daughter You can come on in you can come in
