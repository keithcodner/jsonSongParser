[Verse 1] 
As I travel through this pilgrim land There is a friend who walks with me Leads me safely through the sinking sand It is the Christ of Calvary


[Verse 2] 
This would be my pray'r dear Lord each day To help me do the best I can, For I need thy light to guide me day and night, Blessed Jesus hold my hand


[Verse 3] 
Jesus hold my hand I need thee ev'ry hour Through this pilgrim land Protect me by thy pow'r


[Verse 4] 
Hear my feeble plea, Oh Lord look down on me When I kneel in pray'r I hope to meet you there, Blessed Jesus hold my hand


[Verse 5] 
Let me travel in the light divine That I may see the blessed way, Keep me that I may be wholly thine And sing redemption's song some day


[Verse 6] 
I will be a soldier brave and true And ever firmly take a stand, As I onward go and daily meet the foe, Blessed Jesus hold my hand


[Verse 7] 
When I wander thru the valley Dim toward the setting sun, Lead me safely to a land of rest If I a crown of life have won


[Verse 8] 
I have put my faith in thee dear Lord That I may reach the golden strand, There's no friend on whom I can depend, Blessed Jesus hold my hand
