[Verse 5] 
Give your life to Jesus, let Him fill your soul, Let Him take you in His arms and make you whole, As you give your life to Him, He'll set you free, You will live and reign with Him eternally. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.


[Verse 6] 
Come now Holy Spirit and take control, Hold me in you loving arms and make me whole, Wipe away all doubt and fear and takemy pride, Draw me to your love and keep me by your side. Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.


[Verse 7] 
Let your living water flow over my soul, Let your Holy Spirit come and take control, Of every situation that has troubled my mind, All my cares and burdens onto You I roll. Father, Jesus, Spirit
