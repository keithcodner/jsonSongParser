[Verse 1] 
For we trust in our God And through His unfailing love We will not be shaken


[Verse 2] 
Though the battle rages We will stand in the fight Though the armies rise up Against us on all sides


[Verse 3] 
We will not be shaken We will not be shaken We will not be shaken


[Verse 4] 
For in the hour of our darkest day We will not tremble We won't be afraid


[Verse 5] 
Hope is rising like the light of dawn Our God is for us He has overcome


[Verse 6] 
For we trust in our God And through His unfailing love We will not be shaken We will not be shaken We will not be shaken


[Verse 7] 
All those against Him will fall For our God is stronger He can do all things No higher name we can call For Jesus is greater We can do all things For Jesus is greater We can do all things


[Verse 8] 
For we trust in our God And through His unfailing love We will not be shaken We will not be shaken We will not be shaken
