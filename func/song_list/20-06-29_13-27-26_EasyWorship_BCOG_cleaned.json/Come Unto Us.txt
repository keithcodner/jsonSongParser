[Verse 1] 
This is our song One humble plea Lord here we are In need of Thee And so we wait With expectations As we proclaim The God of Jacob


[Verse 2] 
Come come unto us Come unto us Breath of heaven Breathe breathe into us Life out of dust Spirit of Jesus


[Verse 3] 
Weary we fall Before Your throne Just travelers Longing for home With confidence Sealed by Your blood Lord we approach You The King of love


[Verse 4] 
God is with us Hallelujah Emmanuel Christ is risen Hallelujah Emmanuel
