[Verse 1] 
You are the Love of my life You are the Hope that I cling to You mean more than this world to me I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold I wouldn't trade You for riches untold You are You are my everything


[Verse 2] 
I wouldn't live one day without You I could never go on I wouldn't take one step without You Cause I don't have the strentgh to make it on my own
