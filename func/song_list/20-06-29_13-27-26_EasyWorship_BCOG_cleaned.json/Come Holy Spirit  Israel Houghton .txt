[Verse 1] 
Come Holy Spirit, Oh how we need you Come Holy Spirit we need you Come with grace and fire Mighty rushing wind Comforter and breath of heaven Fill my heart again


[Verse 2] 
Come Holy Spirit, Oh how we need you Come Holy Spirit we need you Come with Heavens power Let the rains descend Times of sweet refreshing Jesus fill my heart, heal my heart Fill my heart again


[Verse 3] 
Come Holy Spirit, Oh how We need you Come Holy Spirit we need you


[Verse 4] 
I need thee oh I need thee Every hour I need thee Bless me now my savior I come to thee I praise you, I praise you Praise the name of Jesus He's my rock, He's my fortress He's my deliverer in him will I trust Praise the name of Jesus I worship you, I worship you I worship you, I worship you


[Verse 5] 
I give you praise For you are my righteousness I worship you almighty God There is none like you
