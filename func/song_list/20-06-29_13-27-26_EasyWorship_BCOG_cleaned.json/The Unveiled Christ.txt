[Verse 1] 
O, behold the Man of sorrows! O, behold Him in plain view! Lo! He is the mighty conqu'ror Since He rent the veil in two. Lo! He is the mighty conqu'ror Since He rent the veil in two.


[Verse 2] 
Once our blessed Christ of beauty Was veiled off from human view; But thro' suff'ring, death, and sorrow He has rent the veil in two.


[Verse 3] 
Yes, He is with God, the Father, Interceding there for you; For He is the mighty conqu'ror Since He rent the veil in two.


[Verse 4] 
Holy angels bow before Him, Men of earth give praises due; For He is the well beloved, Since He rent the veil in two.


[Verse 5] 
Thro'out time and endless ages, Heights and depths of love so true, He alone can be the giver, Since He rent the veil in two.
