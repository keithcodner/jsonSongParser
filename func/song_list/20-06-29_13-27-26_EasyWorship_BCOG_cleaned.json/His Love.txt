[Verse 1] 
He giveth more grace when the burden grows greater He addeth when the labour increase To addes afficition He addeth His mercy To multiplied trials His Multiplied peace


[Verse 2] 
His love has no limit He grace has no measure His love has no boundaries known unto men For out of His intinite riches in Jesus He giveth and giveth and giveth again
