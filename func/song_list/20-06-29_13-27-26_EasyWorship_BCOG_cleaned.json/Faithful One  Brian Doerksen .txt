[Verse 1] 
Faithful one, so unchanging Ageless one, you're my rock of peace Lord of all I depend on You I call out to you, again and again I call out to you, again and again


[Verse 2] 
You are my rock in times of trouble You lift me up when I fall down All through the storm Your love is the anchor My hope is in you alone
