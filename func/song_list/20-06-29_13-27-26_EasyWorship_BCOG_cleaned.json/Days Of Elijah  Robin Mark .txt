[Verse 1] 
These are the days of Elijah Declaring the word of the Lord And these are the days of Your servant Moses Righteousness being restored


[Verse 2] 
And though these are days of great trials Of famine and darkness and sword Still we are the voice in the desert crying Prepare ye the way of the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Behold He comes Riding on a cloud Shining like the sun At the trumpet call So lift your voice It's the year of jublilee Out of Zions hills Salvation comes


[Verse 4] 
These are the days of Ezekiel The dry bones becoming as flesh And these are the days of Your servant David Rebuilding a temple of praise


[Verse 5] 
And these are the days of the harvest The fields are as white in the world And we are the labourers in Your vineyard Declaring the word of the Lord


[Verse 6] 
There's no God like Jehovah
