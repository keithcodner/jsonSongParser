[Verse 1] 
Are you hurting and broken within Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin Jesus is calling Have you come to the end of yourself Do you thirst for a drink from the well Jesus is calling


[Verse 2] 
O come to the altar The Father's arms are open wide Forgiveness was bought with The precious blood of Jesus Christ


[Verse 3] 
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes Come today there's no reason to wait Jesus is calling Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy From the ashes a new life is born Jesus is calling


[Verse 4] 
O come to the altar The Father's arms are open wide Forgiveness was bought with The precious blood of Jesus Christ


[Verse 5] 
Oh what a Savior Isn't He wonderful Sing alleluia, Christ is risen Bow down before Him For He is Lord of all Sing alleluia, Christ is risen


[Verse 6] 
O come to the altar The Father's arms are open wide Forgiveness was bought with The precious blood of Jesus Christ


[Verse 7] 
Thank you Jesus Just as I am I come Halleluia Oh what amazing love


[Verse 8] 
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown Tell the world of the treasure you've found
