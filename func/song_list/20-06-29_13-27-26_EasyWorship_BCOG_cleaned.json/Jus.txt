[Verse 1] 
You unravel me with a melody You surround me with a song Of deliverance from my enemies 'Til all my fears are gone


[Verse 2] 
I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God


[Verse 3] 
From my mother's womb You have chosen me Love has called my name I've been born again to a family Your blood flows through my veins


[Verse 4] 
I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God


[Verse 5] 
I am surrounded By the arms of the Father I am surrounded By songs of deliverance


[Verse 6] 
We've been liberated From our bondage We're the sons and the daughters Let us sing our freedom


[Verse 7] 
You split the sea So I could walk right through it My fears are drowned in perfect love You rescued me And I will stand and sing I am a child of God


[Verse 8] 
You split the sea So I could walk right through it You drown my fears in perfect love You rescued me And I will stand and sing I am a child of God


[Verse 9] 
Yes, I am I am a child of God I am a child of God Yes, I am I am a child of God Full of faith Yes, I am a child of God I am a child of God


[Verse 10] 
I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God
