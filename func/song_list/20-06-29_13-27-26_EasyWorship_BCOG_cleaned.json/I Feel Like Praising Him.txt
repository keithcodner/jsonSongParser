[Verse 1] 
I feel like praising Him praising Him I feel like praising Him praising Him Praise Him in the morning Praise Him all day long I feel like praising praising Him


[Verse 2] 
If You don't want to praise Him Don't hinder me If You don't want to praise Him Don't hinder me Praise Him in the morning Praise Him all day long I feel like praising praising Him


[Verse 3] 
I'm gonna praise Him while I have the chance I'm gonna praise Him while I have the chance Praise Him in the morning Praise Him all day long I feel like praising praising Him
