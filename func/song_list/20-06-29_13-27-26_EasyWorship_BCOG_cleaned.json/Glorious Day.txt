[Verse 1] 
I was buried beneath my shame Who could carry that kind of weight? It was my tomb 'Til I met You


[Verse 2] 
I was breathing, but not alive All my failures I tried to hide It was my tomb 'Til I met You


[Verse 3] 
You called my name Then I ran out of that grave Out of the darkness Into Your glorious day You called my name And I ran out of that grave Out of the darkness Into Your glorious day


[Verse 4] 
Now Your mercy has saved my soul Now Your freedom is all that I know The old made new Jesus, when I met You, whoa, what a day


[Verse 5] 
When you called my name And I ran out of that grave Out of the darkness Into Your glorious day You called my name Then I ran out of that grave Out of the darkness Into Your glorious day


[Verse 6] 
I needed rescue My sin was heavy But chains break at the weight of Your glory I needed shelter I was an orphan But You call me a citizen of Heaven When I was broken You were my healing Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing I have a future My eyes are open 'Cause when you called my name


[Verse 7] 
I ran out of that grave Out of the darkness Into Your glorious day You called my name And I ran out of that grave Out of the darkness Into Your glorious day
