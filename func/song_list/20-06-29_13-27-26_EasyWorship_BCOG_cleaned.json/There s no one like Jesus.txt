[Verse 1] 
There's no one, there's no one like Jesus; There's no one, there's no one like Him There's no one, there's no one like Jesus; There's no one, there's no one like Him


[Verse 2] 
I have traveled everywhere, no one I have looked everywhere, no one I have searched everywhere, no one There is no one like him
