[Verse 1] 
My Savior loves My Savior lives My Savior's always there for me My God He was My God He is My God is always gonna be


[Verse 2] 
My Savior loves My Savior lives My Savior's always there for me My God He was My God He is My God is always gonna be


[Verse 3] 
I am not skilled to understand What God has willed what God has planned I only know at His right hand Stands One who is my Savior


[Verse 4] 
I take Him at His word and deed Christ died to save me this I read And in my heart I find a need Of Him to be my Savior


[Verse 5] 
Misc 1 BRIDGE That He would leave His place on high And come for sinful man to die You count it strange so once did I Before I knew my Savior


[Verse 6] 
Yes living dying let me bring My strength my solace from this spring That He who lives to be my King Once died to be my Savior
