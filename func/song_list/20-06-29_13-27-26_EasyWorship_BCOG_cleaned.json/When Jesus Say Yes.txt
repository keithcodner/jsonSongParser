[Verse 1] 
I'm not worried about a thing Cause i know you are guiding me Where you lead me Lord i will go I have no fear cause I know who's in control


[Verse 2] 
There's no limit to what can do Cause it all belongs to you Yes it all belongs to you You're almighty and all powerful And it all belongs to you Yes, it all belongs to you


[Verse 3] 
When Jesus say yes Nobody can say no


[Verse 4] 
When Jesus bless me Nobody can curse me


[Verse 5] 
When Jesus lifts me up Nobody can pull me down


[Verse 6] 
When Jesus open the door Nobody can close it
