[Verse 1] 
And everywhere I go I see You And everywhere I go I see You And everywhere I go I see You And everywhere I go I see You


[Verse 2] 
Lord You're leading me With a cloud by day And then in the night The glow of a burning flame


[Verse 3] 
And You take my hand And You wash it clean I know the promised land Is light years ahead of me


[Verse 4] 
And the eagle flies And the rivers run I look through the night And I can see the rising sun


[Verse 5] 
Well the grass will die And the flowers fall But Your Word's alive And it will be after all
