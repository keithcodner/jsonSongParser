[Verse 1] 
Man of Sorrows! What a name For the Son of God who came; Ruined sinners to reclaim, Hallelujah! What a Savior!


[Verse 2] 
Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood; Sealed my pardon with His blood, Hallelujah! What a Savior!


[Verse 3] 
Guilty vile and helpless we, Spotless Lamb of God was He; Full atonement can it be, Hallelujah! What a Savior!


[Verse 4] 
Lifted up was He to die, "It is finished!" was His cry; Now in heaven, exalted high, Hallelujah! What a Savior!


[Verse 5] 
When He comes, our glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring; Then anew this song we'll sing, Hallelujah! What a Savior!
