[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest name I know, Fills my ev'ry longing, Keeps me singing as I go.


[Verse 2] 
There's within my heart a melody. Jesus whispers sweet and low: "Fear not, I am with thee; peace, be still," In all of life's ebb and flow.


[Verse 3] 
All my life was wrecked by sin and strife; Discord filled my life with pain. Jesus swept across the broken strings, Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.


[Verse 4] 
Feasting on the riches of His grace, Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing, Always looking on His smiling face, That is why I shout and sing.


[Verse 5] 
Tho' sometimes He leads thro' waters deep, Trials fall across my way, Tho' sometimes the path seems rough and steep, See His footprints all the way.


[Verse 6] 
Soon He's coming back to welcome me Far beyond the starry sky. I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown; I shall reign with Him on high.
