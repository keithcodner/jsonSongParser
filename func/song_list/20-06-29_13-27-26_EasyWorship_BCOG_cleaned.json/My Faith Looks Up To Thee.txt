[Verse 1] 
My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine! Now hear me while I pray; Take all my guilt away. Oh let me from this day Be wholly Thine!


[Verse 2] 
May Thy rich grace impart Strength to my fainting heart, My zeal inspire. As Thou hast died for me, Oh may my love to Thee Pure, warm and changeless be, A living fire.


[Verse 3] 
While life's dark maze I tread, And griefs around me spread Be Thou my Guide. Bid darkness turn to day; Wipe sorrow's tears away; Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside!


[Verse 4] 
When ends life's transient dream, When death's cold sullen stream Shall o'er me roll, Blest Savior, then in love, Fear and distrust remove. Oh bear me safe above, A ransomed soul.
