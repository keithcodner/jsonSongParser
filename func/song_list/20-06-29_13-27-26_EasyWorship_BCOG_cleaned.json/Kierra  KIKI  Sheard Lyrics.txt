[Verse 1] 
"Indescribable" From the higest of heights to the depths of the sea Creations revealing your majesty From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring Every creature unique in the song that it sings


[Verse 2] 
Indescribable, uncontainable, You place the stars in the sky and you know Them by name, You are amazing God All powerful, untamable, awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly Proclaim, You are amazing God


[Verse 3] 
Who sees lightning bolts and tells them where they should go or Sees heavenly store houses laden in snow Who imagined the sun and gave source to it's light Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night None can fathom


[Verse 4] 
Incoquerable, unchangeable, You've seen the depths of my heart and you love Me the same, You are amazing God You are amazing God
