[Verse 1] 
God will make a way Where there seems to be no way He works in ways we cannot see He will make a way for me He will be my guide Hold me closely to His side With love and strength For each new day He will make a way


[Verse 2] 
By a roadway in the wilderness He'll lead me And rivers in the desert will I see Heaven and earth will fade But His word will remain He will do something today
