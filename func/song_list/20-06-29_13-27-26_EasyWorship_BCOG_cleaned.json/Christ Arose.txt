[Verse 1] 
Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty triumph o'er His foes; He arose a victor From the dark domain And He lives forever With His saints to reign. He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!


[Verse 2] 
Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Savior! Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!


[Verse 3] 
Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus my Savior! Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus my Lord!


[Verse 4] 
Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus my Savior! He tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!
