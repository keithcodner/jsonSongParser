[Verse 1] 
Jesus, lover of my soul, Let me to Thy bosom fly, While the billows near me roll, While the tempest still is high; Hide me, O my Saviour, hide! Till the storm of life is past; Safe into the haven guide, O receive my soul at last!


[Verse 2] 
Other refuge have I none, Hangs my helpless soul on Thee; Leave, O leave me not alone! Still support and comfort me; All my trust on Thee is stayed, All my help from Thee I bring; Cover my defenseless head With the shadow of Thy wing.


[Verse 3] 
Thou, O Christ, art all I want, More than all in Thee I find; Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, Heal the sick, and lead the blind. Just and holy is Thy name, I am all unrighteousness; Vile and full of sin I am, Thou art full of truth and grace.


[Verse 4] 
Plenteous grace with Thee is found Grace to pardon all my sin; Let the healing streams abound, Make and keep me pure within; Thou of life the Fountain art, Freely let me take of Thee; Spring Thou up within my heart, Rise to all eternity.
