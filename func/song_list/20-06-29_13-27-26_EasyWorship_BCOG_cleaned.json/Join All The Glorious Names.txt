[Verse 1] 
Join all the glorious names, Of wisdom love and power; That ever mortals knew, That angels ever bore. All are too mean to speak His worth, Too mean to set my Savior forth.


[Verse 2] 
Great prophet of my God, My tongue would bless Thy name; By Thee the joyful news, Of our salvation came; The joyful news of sins forgiven, Of hell subdued and peace with heaven.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, my great High Priest, Offered His blood and died; My guilty conscience seeks No sacrifice beside; His powerful blood did once atone, And now it pleads before the throne.


[Verse 4] 
My Savior and my Lord, My Conqueror and my King; Thy scepter and Thy sword, Thy reigning grace I sing; Thine is the power behold I sit, In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.


[Verse 5] 
Now let my soul arise And tread the tempter down; My Captain leads me forth, To conquest and a crown; A feeble saint shall win the day, Though death and hell obstruct the way.


[Verse 6] 
Should all the hosts of death And powers of hell unknown Put their most dreadful forms Of rage and malice on, I shall be safe for Christ displays, Superior power and guardian grace.
