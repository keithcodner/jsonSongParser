[Verse 1] 
O for a faith that will not shrink, Tho' pressed by ev'ry foe, That will not tremble on the brink Of any earthly woe!


[Verse 2] 
That will not murmur nor complain, Beneath the chastening rod But in the hour of grief or pain, Will lean upon its God.


[Verse 3] 
A faith that shines more bright and clear When tempests rage without; That when in danger knows no fear, In darkness feels no doubt.


[Verse 4] 
That bears, unmoved, the world's dread frown, Nor heeds its scornful smile; That seas of trouble cannot drown, Nor Satan's arts beguile.


[Verse 5] 
Lord give us such a faith as this; And then whate'er may come, We'll taste e'en here the hollowed bliss, Of an eternal home.
