[Verse 1] 
Everyone needs compassion A love that's neverending Let mercy fall on me


[Verse 2] 
Everyone needs forgiveness The kindness of a Saviour The hope of nations


[Verse 3] 
Saviour, He can move the mountains My God is Mighty to save, He is Mighty to save


[Verse 4] 
Forever, Author of salvation He rose and conquered the grave Jesus conquered the grave


[Verse 5] 
So take me as You find me All my fears and failures Fill my life again


[Verse 6] 
I give my life to follow Everything I believe in Now I surrender all


[Verse 7] 
Shine your light and let the whole world see We're singing for the glory of the risen King Jesus
