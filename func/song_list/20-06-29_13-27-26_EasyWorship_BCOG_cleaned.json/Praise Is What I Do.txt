[Verse 1] 
Praise is what I do When I want to be close to You I lift my hands in praise


[Verse 2] 
Praise is who I am I will praise You while I can I'll bless You at times


[Verse 3] 
I vow to praise You In the good and the bad I'll praise You Whether happy or sad I'll praise You In all that I go through Because praise is what I do For I owe it all to You
