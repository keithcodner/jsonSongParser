[Verse 1] 
How precious How lovely are Your thoughts, oh Lord, toward me How truly amazing Is the grace that You have shown Oh Majesty, I live to see your grace


[Verse 2] 
I will search for You And I will find You, I will find You With all my heart I will lift my hands to You in worship I will worship, with all my heart


[Verse 3] 
How gracious, relentless Is the Father's love toward me Breathtaking, the beauty, And the radiance of You Oh majesty, I live to see your face and be transformed into Your image


[Verse 4] 
Oh, oh I will worship You with all my heart
