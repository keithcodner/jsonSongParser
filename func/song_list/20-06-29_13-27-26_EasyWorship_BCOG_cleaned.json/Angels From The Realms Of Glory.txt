[Verse 1] 
Angels from the realms of glory, Wing your flight o'er all the earth; Ye who sang creation's story, Now proclaim Messiah's birth. Come and worship, come and worship; Worship Christ, the new-born King!


[Verse 2] 
Shepherds in the fields abiding, Watching o'er your flocks by night; God with man is now residing, Yonder shines the infant Light. Come and worship, come and worship; Worship Christ, the new-born King!


[Verse 3] 
Sages, leave your contemplation's, Brighter visions beam afar; Seek the great Desire of nations, Ye have seen His natal star. Come and worship, come and worship; Worship Christ, the new-born King!


[Verse 4] 
Saints, before the altar bending, Watching long in hope and fear; Suddenly the Lord, descending, In His temple shall appear. Come and worship, come and worship; Worship Christ, the new-born King!


[Verse 5] 
All creation, join in praising, God, the Father, Spirit, Son; Evermore your voices raising, To the eternal Three in One. Come and worship, come and worship; Worship Christ, the new-born King!
