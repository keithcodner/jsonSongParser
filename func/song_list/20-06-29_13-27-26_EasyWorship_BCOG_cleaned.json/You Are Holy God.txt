[Verse 1] 
You are holy holy You are holy God You are holy holy You are holy God


[Verse 2] 
Here in this quiet place I rest in Your embrace Here in these tender moments with You I see You on the throne I trust in You alone Here in these quiet moments with You


[Verse 3] 
Here in the stillness of Your pure anointed love I cherish every moment with You I feel Your beating heart But I only know in part The fullness of each moment with You
