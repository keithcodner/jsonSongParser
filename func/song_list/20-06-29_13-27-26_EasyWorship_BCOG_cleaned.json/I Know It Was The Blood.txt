[Verse 1] 
I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood For me


[Verse 2] 
One day when I was lost Jesus died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me


[Verse 3] 
They hung Him on a tree...


[Verse 4] 
They pup Him in a grave...


[Verse 5] 
On the third day He arose...


[Verse 6] 
He's coming back again...
