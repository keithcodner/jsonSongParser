[Verse 1] 
Jehovah Jireh my provider You are more than enough for me Jehovah Rapha, You're my healer By Your stripes I've been set free


[Verse 2] 
Jehovah Shammah, You are with me You supply all my needs You are more than enough More than enough You are more than enough for me


[Verse 3] 
You are more than enough More than enough You are more than enough for me
