[Verse 1] 
I have journeyed Through the long, dark night Out on the open sea


[Verse 2] 
By faith alone Sight unknown And yet His eyes were watching me


[Verse 3] 
The anchor holds Through the ship is battered The anchor holds Though the sails are torn


[Verse 4] 
I have fallen on my knees As I face the raging seas The anchor holds In spite of the storm


[Verse 5] 
Have you fallen on your knees As you face the raging seas The anchor holds In spite of the storm


[Verse 6] 
I've had visions I've had dreams I've even held them in my hand


[Verse 7] 
But I never knew They would slip right through Like they were only grains of sand
