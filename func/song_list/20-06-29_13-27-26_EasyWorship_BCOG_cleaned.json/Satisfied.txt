[Verse 1] 
Hallelujah! I have found Him Whom my soul so long has craved! Jesus satisfies my longings; Thro' His blood I now am saved.


[Verse 2] 
All my lifelong I had panted, For a draught from some cool spring That I hoped would quench the burning Of the thirst I felt within.


[Verse 3] 
Feeding on the husks around me Till my strength was almost gone, Longed my soul for something better, Only still to hunger on.


[Verse 4] 
Poor I was and sought for riches, Something that would satisfy; But the dust I gathered round me Only mocked my soul's sad cry.


[Verse 5] 
Well of water, ever springing, Bread of life, so rich and free, Untold wealth that never faileth, My Redeemer is to me.
