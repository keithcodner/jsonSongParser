[Verse 1] 
The head that once was crowned with thorns Is crowned with glory now The Savior knelt to wash our feet Now at His feet we bow


[Verse 2] 
The One who wore our sin and shame Now robed in majesty The radiance of perfect love Now shines for all to see


[Verse 3] 
Your name, Your name Is victory All praise, will rise To Christ, our king


[Verse 4] 
The fear that held us now gives way To Him who is our peace His final breath upon the cross Is now alive in me


[Verse 5] 
Your name, Your name Is victory All praise, will rise To Christ, our king


[Verse 6] 
Your name, Your name Is victory All praise, will rise To Christ, our king


[Verse 7] 
By Your spirit I will rise From the ashes of defeat The resurrected King, is resurrecting me In Your name I come alive To declare Your victory The resurrected King, is resurrecting me


[Verse 8] 
By Your spirit I will rise From the ashes of defeat The resurrected King, is resurrecting me In Your name I come alive To declare Your victory The resurrected King, is resurrecting me


[Verse 9] 
By Your spirit I will rise From the ashes of defeat The resurrected King, is resurrecting me In Your name I come alive To declare Your victory The resurrected king, is resurrecting me


[Verse 10] 
He's resurrecting me Our God is good, oh


[Verse 11] 
The tomb where soldiers watched in vain Was borrowed for three days His body there would not remain Our God has robbed the grave Our God has robbed the grave (yes He has, yes He has)


[Verse 12] 
Your name, Your name Is victory All praise, will rise To Christ our king Your name, Your name Is victory All praise, will rise To Christ our king


[Verse 13] 
By Your spirit I will rise From the ashes of defeat The resurrected King, is resurrecting me In Your name I come alive To declare Your victory The resurrected King, is resurrecting me


[Verse 14] 
By Your spirit I will rise From the ashes of defeat The resurrected King, is resurrecting me In Your name I come alive To declare Your victory The resurrected King, is resurrecting me


[Verse 15] 
By Your spirit I will rise From the ashes of defeat The resurrected King, is resurrecting me In Your name I come alive To declare Your victory The resurrected king, is resurrecting me
