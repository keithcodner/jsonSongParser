[Verse 1] 
This praise is rising in my heart This passion is burning deep within I'm gonna lift Your name up every day And tell the world that You’re the only way


[Verse 2] 
Come and fill me with You power It’s in You I find my strength I’m gonna live my life for You alone


[Verse 3] 
Jesus my heart is crying out For more of You King of all kings, and Lord of lords My life is Yours


[Verse 4] 
You are the only one for me And I’ll keep singing On and on and on to You my King


[Verse 5] 
I’m gonna live for You in all I do Jesus, You are everything to me You are everything to me


[Verse 6] 
My life is all for You Lord Take over all of me I live to worship You alone
