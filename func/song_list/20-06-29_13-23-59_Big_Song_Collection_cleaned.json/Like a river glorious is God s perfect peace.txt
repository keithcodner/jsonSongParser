[Verse 1] 
Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace, Over all victorious, in its bright increase: Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day; Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.


[Verse 2] 
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest; Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.


[Verse 3] 
Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand, Never foe can follow, never traitor stand; Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care, Not a blast of hurry touched the Spirit there.


[Verse 4] 
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest; Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.


[Verse 5] 
Every joy or trial falleth from above, Traced upon our dial by the sun of love. We may trust Him fully, all for us to do; They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true. 


[Verse 6] 
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest; Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.
