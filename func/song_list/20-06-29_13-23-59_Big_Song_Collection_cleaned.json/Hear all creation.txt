[Verse 1] 
Hear all creation lift its voice, The mountains sing and the rivers rejoice For the name of Jesus, For His name. ||And we His people saved by grace, We bow our hearts and we bring our praise To the sweet Redeemer, For His name.


[Verse 2] 
So with everything we are, And everything we have We pour out our offerings. And if ever we should fail, The rocks will rise up And crown Him the King of kings.


[Verse 3] 
He mends our hearts, He keeps our ways: He lights our nights and He leads our days, All for His glory, for His name. ||There's nothing greater than to be His, To bring Him glory and to fully live For the name of Jesus, For His name.


[Verse 4] 
So with everything we are, And everything we have We pour out our offerings. And if ever we should fail, The rocks will rise up And crown Him the King of kings.
