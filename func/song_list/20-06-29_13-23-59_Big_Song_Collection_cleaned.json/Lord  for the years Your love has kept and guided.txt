[Verse 1] 
Lord, for the years Your love has kept and guided, Urged and inspired us, Cheered us on our way, Sought us and saved us, Pardoned and provided: Lord of the years, We bring our thanks today.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, for that word, The word of life which fires us, Speaks to our hearts And sets our souls ablaze, Teaches and trains, Rebukes us and inspires us: Lord of the word, Receive Your people's praise.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, for our land In this our generation, Spirits oppressed by pleasure, Wealth and care: For young and old, For commonwealth and nation, Lord of our land, Be pleased to hear our prayer.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, for our world Where men disown and doubt You, Loveless in strength, And comfortless in pain, Hungry and helpless, Lost indeed without You: Lord of the world, We pray that Christ may reign.


[Verse 5] 
Lord for ourselves; In living power remake us - Self on the cross And Christ upon the throne, Past put behind us, For the future take us: Lord of our lives, To live for Christ alone.
