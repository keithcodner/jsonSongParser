[Verse 1] 
He once was dead, but now He lives: The First, the Last, the Living One. He holds the keys of death and hell: The First, the Last, the Living One.


[Verse 2] 
More love, our hearts on fire. More power, so faith stands strong. More life, both real and pure. More faith that holds the truth. More, Lord, of You within Your church. You, Lord, are King most glorious.


[Verse 3] 
We hear Your voice, we come to You: The First, the Last, the Living One. We will obey and follow You: The First, the Last, the Living One.


[Verse 4] 
The First, the Last, the Living One. Lord, by Your word we overcome. We live our lives to You alone: The First, the Last, the Living One.


[Verse 5] 
You, Lord, the One who knows us. You, Lord, the love that calls us. You, Lord, have power to keep us. You, Lord, speak words of promise. You, Lord, the life victorious. You, Lord, are King most glorious.


[Verse 6] 
The First, the Last, the Living One. Lord, by Your word we overcome. We live our lives to You alone: The First, the Last, the Living One.


[Verse 7] 
You once were dead, but now You live: The First, the Last, the Living One. You hold the keys of death and hell: The First, the Last, the Living One.


[Verse 8] 
The First, the Last, the Living One. Lord, by Your word we overcome. We live our lives to You alone: The First, the Last, the Living One.
