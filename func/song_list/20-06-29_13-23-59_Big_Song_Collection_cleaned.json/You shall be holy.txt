[Verse 1] 
You shall be holy And in everything be true, For I, the Lord, am holy, And My word belongs to you.


[Verse 2] 
Stay in my presence, Grow strong in My love, With all the gifts I give you From My kingdom here above.


[Verse 3] 
We are Your children, Abba Father, mighty God, And growing in Your likeness, Through grace of Jesus' blood.


[Verse 4] 
Inspired by Your Spirit, Our eternal source of power, Release us to worship, And to praise You every hour.
