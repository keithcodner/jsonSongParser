[Verse 1] 
Jesus is the name we honour; Jesus is the name we praise. Majestic Name above all Other names, The highest heaven and Earth proclaim That Jesus is our God.


[Verse 2] 
We will glorify, We will lift Him high, We will give Him honour and praise. We will glorify, We will lift Him high, We will give Him honour and praise.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is the name we worship; Jesus is the name we trust. He is the King above all other kings, Let all creation stand and sing That Jesus is our God.


[Verse 4] 
We will glorify, We will lift Him high, We will give Him honour and praise. We will glorify, We will lift Him high, We will give Him honour and praise.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus is the Father's splendour; Jesus is the Father's joy. He will return to reign in majesty, And every eye at last shall see That Jesus is our God. 


[Verse 6] 
We will glorify, We will lift Him high, We will give Him honour and praise. We will glorify, We will lift Him high, We will give Him honour and praise.
