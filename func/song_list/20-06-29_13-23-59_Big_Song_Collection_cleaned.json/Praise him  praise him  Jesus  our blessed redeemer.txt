[Verse 1] 
Praise him, praise him! Jesus, our blessed redeemer; Sing, O earth, His wonderful love proclaim! Hail Him, hail Him! highest archangels in glory, Strength and honour give to His holy name. ||Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children, In His arms He carries them all day long; O ye saints that dwell in the mountains of Zion, Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song.


[Verse 2] 
Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer; For our sins He suffered and bled and died. He, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation, Hail Him, hail Him! Jesus the Crucified. ||Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow, Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow; Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken, Prince of glory, ever triumphant now.


[Verse 3] 
Praise Him, praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer; Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring! Jesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever, Crown Him, crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King! ||Death is vanquished, tell it with joy, ye faithful! Where is now thy victory, boasting grave? Jesus lives, no longer thy portals are cheerless; Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.
