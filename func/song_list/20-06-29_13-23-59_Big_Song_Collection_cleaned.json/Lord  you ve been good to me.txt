[Verse 1] 
Lord, you've been good to me All my life, all my life; Your loving kindness never fails. I will remember all You have done, Bring from my heart thanksgiving songs.


[Verse 2] 
New every morning is Your love, Filled with compassion from above. Grace and forgiveness full and free, Lord, You've been good to me.


[Verse 3] 
So, may each breath I take Be for You, Lord, only You, Giving You back the life I owe. Love so amazing, mercy so free. Lord, You've been good, So good to me.


[Verse 4] 
New every morning is Your love, Filled with compassion from above. Grace and forgiveness full and free, Lord, You've been good to me.
