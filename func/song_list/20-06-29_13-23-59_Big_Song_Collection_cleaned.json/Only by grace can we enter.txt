[Verse 1] 
Only by grace can we enter, Only by grace can we stand; Not by our human endeavour, But by the blood of the Lamb. || Into Your presence You call us, You call us to come. Into Your presence You draw us, And now by Your grace we come, Now by Your grace we come.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, if You mark our transgressions, Who would stand? Thanks to Your grace we are cleansed By the blood of the Lamb. (Repeat)
