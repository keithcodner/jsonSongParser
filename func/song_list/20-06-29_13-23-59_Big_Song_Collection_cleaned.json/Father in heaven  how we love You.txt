[Verse 1] 
Father in heaven, How we love You, We lift Your name In all the earth. May Your kingdom Be established in our praises As Your people declare Your mighty works.


[Verse 2] 
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come; Blessed be the Lord God Almighty, Who reigns forever more.
