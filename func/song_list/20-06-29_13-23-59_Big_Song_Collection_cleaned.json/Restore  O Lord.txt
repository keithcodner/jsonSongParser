[Verse 1] 
Restore, O Lord, The honour of Your name, In works of sovereign power Come shake the earth again; That men may see And come with reverent fear To the living God, Whose kingdom shall outlast the years.


[Verse 2] 
Restore, O Lord, In all the earth Your fame, And in our time revive The church that bears Your name. And in Your anger, Lord, remember mercy, O living God, Whose mercy shall outlast the years.


[Verse 3] 
Bend us, O Lord, Where we are hard and cold, In Your refiner's fire Come purify the gold. Though suffering comes And evil crouches near, Still our living God Is reigning, He is reigning here.


[Verse 4] 
Restore, O Lord, The honour of Your name, In works of sovereign power Come shake the earth again; That men may see And come with reverent fear To the living God, Whose kingdom shall outlast the years.
