[Verse 1] 
Name above all names, The Saviour for sinners slain. You suffered for my sake To bring me back home again. When I was lost, You poured Your life out for me. Name above all names, Jesus, I love You.


[Verse 2] 
Giver of mercy, The fountain of life for me. My spirit is lifted To soar on the eagle's wings. What love is this That fills my heart with treasure? Name above all names, Jesus, I love You.


[Verse 3] 
High King eternal, The one true and faithful God. The beautiful Saviour, Still reigning in power and love. With all my heart I'll worship You forever: Name above all names, Jesus, I love You.
