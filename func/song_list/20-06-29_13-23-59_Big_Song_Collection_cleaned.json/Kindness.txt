[Verse 1] 
[G]Open [D/F#]up the [Em]skies of [D]mercy. [G]Rain [D/F#]down the [Em]cleansing [D]flood. [G]Healing [D/F#]waters [Em]rise [D]around us. [C]Hear our cries, Lord; [D]let 'em rise.


[Verse 2] 
It's Your [C]kindness, [G]Lord, that [Am]leads us to repentance. Your [C]favor, [G]Lord, is our [Am]desire. It's Your [C]beauty, [G]Lord, that [Am]makes us stand in silence And [C]Your love, [C]Your love is better than life.


[Verse 3] 
We can feeel Your mercy falling. You are turning our hearts back again. Hear our praises rise to heaven. Draw us near, Lord, meet us here.
