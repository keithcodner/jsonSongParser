[Verse 1] 
I was lost without a trace, All except for the eyes of heaven. Now my Saviour's love has found me, And His love has brought me home.


[Verse 2] 
I can sleep in peace tonight, I won't worry about tomorrow, Now I know my Daddy loves me, And His perfect love will conquer all.


[Verse 3] 
I'm like a child in His eyes, And He will meet my needs With all the riches of heaven; And He loves me much too much To let me go, He will keep me in His love.


[Verse 4] 
Heaven and earth may pass away, And mountains fall into the ocean; But His word is everlasting, And His love goes on and on. 


[Verse 5] 
I'm like a child in His eyes, And He will meet my needs With all the riches of heaven; And He loves me much too much To let me go, He will keep me in His love.
