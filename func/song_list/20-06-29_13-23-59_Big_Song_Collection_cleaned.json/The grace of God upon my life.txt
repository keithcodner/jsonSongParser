[Verse 1] 
The grace of God upon my life Is not dependent upon me, On what I have done Or deserved, But a gift of mercy from God Which has been given unto me Because of His love, His love for me.


[Verse 2] 
It is unending, unfailing, Unlimited, unmerited, The grace of God given unto me. It is unending, unfailing, Unlimited, unmerited, The grace of God given unto me.
