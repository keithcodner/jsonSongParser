[Verse 1] 
The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's That is our victory cry. The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's That is our victory cry.


[Verse 2] 
We refuse to bow to satan's schemes, Set our wills for righteousness; We declare we'll choose for truth In every situation. We could battle in the heavenlies, Yet in our lives neglect to fight: Saying no to self and no to sin Is where our warfare must begin.


[Verse 3] 
The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's That is our victory cry. The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's, The battle is the Lord's That is our victory cry.


[Verse 4] 
As we're taking ground in daily war, Living lives of righteousness, We will grow in strength to face The bigger situations. And the more of us that battle through, The purer then this church will be; Who will stop us then as we proclaim: 'Strongholds, you have had your day!'
