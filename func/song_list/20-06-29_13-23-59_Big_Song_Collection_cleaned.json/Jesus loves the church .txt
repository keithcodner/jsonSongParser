[Verse 1] 
Jesus loves the church, He gave Himself for His bride. He knows what we will be, A conquering army, An unblemished people. We're accepted, we're forgiven, We're united with Him; Not rejected, not forgotten, Not abandoned in sin. 


[Verse 2] 
Can you hear Him singing, 'I love you, I love you'? Can you hear Him calling, 'I want you, I have chosen you to be Mine'?


[Verse 3] 
Jesus loves the church, His passion through the ages. Hell will not prevail. He builds us together, A living temple. We're accepted, we're forgiven, We're united with Him; Not rejected, not forgotten, Not abandoned in sin.


[Verse 4] 
Can you hear Him singing, 'I love you, I love you'? Can you hear Him calling, 'I want you, I have chosen you to be Mine'?
