[Verse 1] 
In the shadow of the cross, Let everything fall into place again. Jesus Christ, my sacrifice, How I need to find Your grace again.


[Verse 2] 
And nothing I can do Could add to all You've done, So let my soul be satisfied. As I receive Your favour, I will overcome. So in my life be glorified.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus Christ, my perfect Priest, How You understand my weaknesses. Thank You for Your gift to me: Through Your sufferings I now Possess this peace.


[Verse 4] 
And nothing I can do Could add to all You've done, So let my soul be satisfied. As I receive Your favour, I will overcome. So in my life be glorified.
