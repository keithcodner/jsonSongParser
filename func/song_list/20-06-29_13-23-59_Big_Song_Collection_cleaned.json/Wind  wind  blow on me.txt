[Verse 1] 
Wind, wind, blow on me, Wind, wind, set me free, Wind, wind, my Father sent The blessed Holy Spirit.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus told us all about You, How we could not live without You, With His blood the power bought, To help us live the life He taught.


[Verse 3] 
Wind, wind, blow on me, Wind, wind, set me free, Wind, wind, my Father sent The blessed Holy Spirit.


[Verse 4] 
When we're weary, You console us; When we're lonely You enfold us; When in danger You uphold us, Blessed Holy Spirit.


[Verse 5] 
Wind, wind, blow on me, Wind, wind, set me free, Wind, wind, my Father sent The blessed Holy Spirit.


[Verse 6] 
When unto the church You came It was not in Your own but Jesus' name. Jesus Christ is still the same, He sends the Holy Spirit.


[Verse 7] 
Wind, wind, blow on me, Wind, wind, set me free, Wind, wind, my Father sent The blessed Holy Spirit.


[Verse 8] 
Set us free to love our brothers; Set us free to live for others, That the world the Son might see, And Jesus' name exalted be.
