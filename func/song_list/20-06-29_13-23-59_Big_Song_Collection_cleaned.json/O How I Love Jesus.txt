[Verse 1] 
There [E]is a [A/E]name I love to hear. I [B]love to sing it's [E]worth. It [E]sounds like [A/E]music [E]in my [C#m]ear, the s[F#m]weetest [B]name [B7]on e[E]ar[-]th[A/B].


[Verse 2] 
[E]Oh, [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus, [B]Oh how I love [E]Jesus, Oh [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus[C#m] Bec[F#m]ause He [B]first [B7]loved [E]me.


[Verse 3] 
It tells me of a Saviour's love who died to set me free. It tells me of His precious blood, the sinners perfect plea.


[Verse 4] 
[E]Oh, [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus, [B]Oh how I love [E]Jesus, Oh [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus[C#m] Bec[F#m]ause He [B]first [B7]loved [E]me.


[Verse 5] 
It tells me what my Father hath in store for every day, And tho' I tread a darksome path, yields sunshine all the way.


[Verse 6] 
[E]Oh, [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus, [B]Oh how I love [E]Jesus, Oh [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus[C#m] Bec[F#m]ause He [B]first [B7]loved [E]me.


[Verse 7] 
It tells of One whose loving heart can feel my deepest woe, Who in each sorrow bears a part that none can bear below.


[Verse 8] 
[E]Oh, [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus, [B]Oh how I love [E]Jesus, Oh [A/E]How I love [E]Jesus[C#m] Bec[F#m]ause He [B]first [B7]loved [E]me.
