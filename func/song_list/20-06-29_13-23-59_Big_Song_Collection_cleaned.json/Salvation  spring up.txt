[Verse 1] 
Salvation, spring up from the ground, Lord, rend the heavens and come down. Seek the lost and heal the lame; Jesus, bring glory to Your name. Let all the prodigals run home, All of creation waits and groans. Lord, we've heard of Your great fame; Father, cause all to shout Your name.


[Verse 2] 
Stir up our hearts, O God; Open our spirits to awe who You are. Put a cry in us So deep inside, That we cannot find The words we need, We just weep and cry out to You.
