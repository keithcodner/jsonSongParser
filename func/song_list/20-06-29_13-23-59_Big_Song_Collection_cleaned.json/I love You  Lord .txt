[Verse 1] 
I love You, Lord, I worship You, I love You, Lord, always. So thankful, Lord, You saved my life, You saved my life, today. 


[Verse 2] 
Let me be a shining light for You, Let me be a joy to You always. Let me be a shining light for You, Let me be a joy to You always. 


[Verse 3] 
And Lord, I love to bring to You The honour due Your name; Just look at what You've done for me, I'll never be the same.


[Verse 4] 
Let me be a shining light for You, Let me be a joy to You always. Let me be a shining light for You, Let me be a joy to You always.
