[Verse 1] 
Jesus, God's righteousness revealed, The Son of Man, the Son of God, His kingdom comes. Jesus, redemption's sacrifice, Now glorified, now justified, His kingdom comes.


[Verse 2] 
And His kingdom Will know no end, And its glory Shall know no bounds, For the majesty and power Of this kingdom's King has come. || And this kingdom's reign, And this kingdom's rule, And this kingdom's Power and authority, Jesus, God's righteousness revealed.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, The expression of God's love, The grace of God, the Word of God, Revealed to us; Jesus, God's holiness displayed, Now glorified, now justified, His kingdom comes.


[Verse 4] 
And His kingdom Will know no end, And its glory Shall know no bounds, For the majesty and power Of this kingdom's King has come. || And this kingdom's reign, And this kingdom's rule, And this kingdom's Power and authority, Jesus, God's righteousness revealed.
