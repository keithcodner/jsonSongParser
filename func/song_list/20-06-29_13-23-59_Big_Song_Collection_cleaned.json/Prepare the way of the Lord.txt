[Verse 1] 
Prepare the way of the Lord, Make His paths straight, Open the gates, That He may enter freely into our life. 'Hosanna!' we cry to the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
And we will fill the earth with the sound of His praise. Jesus is Lord! Let Him be adored! Yes, we will have this Man to reign over us, Hosanna! We follow the Lord!


[Verse 3] 
And He will come to us as He came before, Clothed in His grace, To stand in our place. And we behold Him now our Priest andKing, 'Hosanna!' we sing to the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
And we will fill the earth with the sound of His praise. Jesus is Lord! Let Him be adored! Yes, we will have this Man to reign over us, Hosanna! We follow the Lord!


[Verse 5] 
His kingdom shall increase, To fill all the earth And show forth His worth. Then every knee shall bow and every tongue confess That Jesus Christ is Lord. 


[Verse 6] 
And we will fill the earth with the sound of His praise. Jesus is Lord! Let Him be adored! Yes, we will have this Man to reign over us, Hosanna! We follow the Lord!
