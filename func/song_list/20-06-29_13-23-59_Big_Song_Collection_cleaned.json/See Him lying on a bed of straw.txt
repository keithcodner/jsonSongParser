[Verse 1] 
See Him lying on a bed of straw, A draughty stable with an open door; Mary cradling the babe she bore; The Prince of glory is His name.


[Verse 2] 
O now carry me to Bethlehem, To see the Lord appear to men; Just as poor as was the stable then, The Prince of glory when He came.


[Verse 3] 
Star of silver, sweep across the skies, Show where Jesus in the manger lies; Shepherds, swiftly from your stupor rise To see the Saviour of the world.


[Verse 4] 
O now carry me to Bethlehem, To see the Lord appear to men; Just as poor as was the stable then, The Prince of glory when He came.


[Verse 5] 
Angels, sing again the song you sang, Bring God's glory to the heart of man; Sing that Bethlehem's little baby can Be salvation to the soul.


[Verse 6] 
O now carry me to Bethlehem, To see the Lord appear to men; Just as poor as was the stable then, The Prince of glory when He came.


[Verse 7] 
Mine are riches, from Thy poverty, From Thine innocence, eternity; Mine, forgiveness by Thy death for me, Child of sorrow for my joy. 


[Verse 8] 
O now carry me to Bethlehem, To see the Lord appear to men; Just as poor as was the stable then, The Prince of glory when He came.
