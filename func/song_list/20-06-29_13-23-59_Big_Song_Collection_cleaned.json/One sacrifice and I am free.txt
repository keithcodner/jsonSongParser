[Verse 1] 
One sacrifice and I am free, The cross of Christ my victory, And on this grace I do believe, yes I believe. Jesus, in death You set me free, Taking the punishment for me, It is Your blood that covers me, yes I believe.


[Verse 2] 
And because of what this love has done My heart is filled with praise.


[Verse 3] 
And so I lift my voice to You, Pouring out all this love on You. What can I give for all You've done for me? I know the Saviour lives today, Heaven and earth may pass away, But I know Your love will never fail.


[Verse 4] 
And every day I live, I vow to follow You.


[Verse 5] 
And so I lift my voice to You, Pouring out all this love on You. What can I give for all You've done for me? I know the Saviour lives today, Heaven and earth may pass away, But I know Your love will never fail.
