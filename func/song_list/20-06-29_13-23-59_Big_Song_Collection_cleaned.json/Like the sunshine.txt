[Verse 1] 
Like the sunshine after rainfall, Like the gentle breeze; Like the stillness of the morning, Like the radiant trees: These things I knew before, But never have they spoken such life to me; Oh, the wonder of a Maker Whose heart delights in me.


[Verse 2] 
Like the nurture of a baby At its mother's breast; Like the closeness of a lover, Like two souls at rest: These things I knew before, But never have they spoken such peace to me; Oh, the wonder of Maker Whose heart delights in me.


[Verse 3] 
The heavens declare His magnificence, The earth resounds with His praise; Be still my soul, and be satisfied To worship Him, To worship Him.


[Verse 4] 
Like the vastness of a desert, Like the ocean's roar; Like the greatness of the mountains, Where the eagles soar: These things I knew before, But never have they spoken such power to me; Oh, the wonder of a Maker Whose heart delights in me.
