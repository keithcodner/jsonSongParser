[Verse 1] 
O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder Consider all the works Thy hand hath made, I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder, Thy power throughout The universe displayed:


[Verse 2] 
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art! Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art!


[Verse 3] 
When through the woods And forest glades I wander And hear the birds Sing sweetly in the trees; When I look down From lofty mountain grandeur, And hear the brook, And feel the gentle breeze;


[Verse 4] 
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art! Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art!


[Verse 5] 
And when I think that God His Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in. That on the cross My burden gladly bearing, He bled and died To take away my sin:


[Verse 6] 
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art! Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art!


[Verse 7] 
When Christ shall come With shout of acclamation And take me home, What joy shall fill my heart! Then shall I bow In humble adoration And there proclaim, My God, how great Thou art! 


[Verse 8] 
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art! Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
