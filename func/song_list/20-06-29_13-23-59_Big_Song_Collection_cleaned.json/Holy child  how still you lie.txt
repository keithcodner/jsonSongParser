[Verse 1] 
Holy child, how still you lie! Safe the manger, soft the hay; Faint upon the eastern sky Breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.


[Verse 2] 
Holy Child, whose birthday brings Shepherds from their field and fold, Angel choirs and eastern kings, Myrrh and frankincense and gold:


[Verse 3] 
Holy Child, what gift of grace From the Father freely willed! In Your infant form we trace All God's promises fulfilled.


[Verse 4] 
Holy Child, whose human years Span like ours delight and pain; One in human joys and tears, One in all but sin and stain:


[Verse 5] 
Holy Child, so far from home, All the lost to seek and save: To what dreadful death You come, To what dark and silent grave!


[Verse 6] 
Holy Child, before whose name Powers of darkness faint and fall; Conquered death and sin and shame - Jesus Christ is Lord of all!


[Verse 7] 
Holy Child, how still You lie! Safe the manger, soft the hay; Clear upon the eastern sky Breaks the dawn of Christmas Day.
