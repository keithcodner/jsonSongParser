[Verse 1] 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path.


[Verse 2] 
When I feel afraid, Think I've lost my way, Still You're there right beside me. And nothing will I fear As long as You are near; Please be near me to the end.


[Verse 3] 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path.


[Verse 4] 
I will not forget Your love for me, and yet My heart forever is wandering. Jesus, be my guide And hold me to Your side, And I will love You to the end. 


[Verse 5] 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path.
