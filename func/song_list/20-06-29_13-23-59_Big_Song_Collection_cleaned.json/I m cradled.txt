[Verse 1] 
I'm cradled, Cradled in the arms of love. Yes, I'm cradled, Cradled in the arms of love.


[Verse 2] 
My struggles for approval Were never meant to be. To know that I'm accepted Is Your desire for me. Because...


[Verse 3] 
I'm cradled, Cradled in the arms of love. Yes, I'm cradled, Cradled in the arms of love.


[Verse 4] 
My fears about the future, All my anxieties, Are calmed when I surrender To the One who's holding me.


[Verse 5] 
I'm cradled, Cradled in the arms of love. Yes, I'm cradled, Cradled in the arms of love.
