[Verse 1] 
Salvation belongs to our God, Who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb. Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, Honour and power and strength:


[Verse 2] 
Be to our God forever and ever, Be to our God forever and ever, Be to our God forever and ever, amen.


[Verse 3] 
And we, the redeemed shall be strong In purpose and unity, Declaring aloud, Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, Honour and power and strength: 


[Verse 4] 
Be to our God forever and ever, Be to our God forever and ever, Be to our God forever and ever, amen.
