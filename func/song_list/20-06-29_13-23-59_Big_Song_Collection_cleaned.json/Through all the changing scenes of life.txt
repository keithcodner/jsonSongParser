[Verse 1] 
Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.


[Verse 2] 
Of His deliverance I will boast, Till all that are distressed From my example comfort take, And charm their griefs to rest.


[Verse 3] 
Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.


[Verse 4] 
O magnify the Lord with me, With me exalt His name; When in distress to Him I called, He to my rescue came.


[Verse 5] 
Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.

The hosts of God encamp around The dwellings of the just; Deliverance He affords to all Who on His succour trust.


[Verse 7] 
Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.

O make but trial of His love; Experience will decide How blest are they, and only they, Who in His truth confide.


[Verse 9] 
Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.

Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then Have nothing else to fear; Make you His service your delight; Your wants shall be His care.

Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.
