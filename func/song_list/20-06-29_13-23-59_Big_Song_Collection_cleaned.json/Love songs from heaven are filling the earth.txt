[Verse 1] 
Love songs from heaven are filling the earth, Bringing great hope to all nations. Evil has prospered, but truth is alive; In this dark world the light still shines.


[Verse 2] 
Nothing has silenced this gospel of Christ; It echoes down through the ages. Blood of the martyrs has made Your church strong; In this dark world the light still shines.


[Verse 3] 
For You we live, And for You we may die; Through us may Jesus be seen. For You alone we will offer our lives; In this dark world our light will shine.


[Verse 4] 
Let every nation be filled with Your song: This is the cry of Your people. We will not settle for anything less, In this dark world our light must shine. 


[Verse 5] 
For You we live, And for You we may die; Through us may Jesus be seen. For You alone we will offer our lives; In this dark world our light will shine.
