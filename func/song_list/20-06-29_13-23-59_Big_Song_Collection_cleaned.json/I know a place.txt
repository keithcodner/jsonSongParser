[Verse 1] 
I know a place Where blessings from heaven are poured, Mercy and grace abounding. Through Jesus' blood We have now been set free Into the Father's loving.


[Verse 2] 
I know a place Where there is no guilt or fear, As I come into His presence. I can now know A peace which surpasses all, Nothing shall separate us.


[Verse 3] 
And I will trust in You alone, My refuge and strength. For all the trials that come my way, Your grace is sufficient for me.


[Verse 4] 
I know a place Where a wonderful river flows, That fills me with His glory; Bringing us life, We're stirred to adore Him, A perfect joy everlasting. 


[Verse 5] 
And I will trust in You alone, My refuge and strength. For all the trials that come my way, Your grace is sufficient for me.
