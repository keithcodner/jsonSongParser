[Verse 1] 
There's no one like You, my Lord, No one could take Your place; My heart beats to worship You, I live just to seek Your face. There's no one like You, my Lord, No one could take Your place; There's no one like You, my Lord, No one like You.


[Verse 2] 
You are my God, You're everything to me; There's no one like You, my Lord, No one like You. You are my God. You're everything to me; There's no one like You, my Lord, No one like You.


[Verse 3] 
There's no one like You, my Lord, No one could take Your place; I long for Your presence, Lord, To serve You is my reward. There's no one like You, my Lord, No one could take Your place; There's no one like You, my Lord, No one like You. 


[Verse 4] 
You are my God, You're everything to me; There's no one like You, my Lord, No one like You. You are my God. You're everything to me; There's no one like You, my Lord, No one like You.
