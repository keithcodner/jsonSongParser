[Verse 1] 
You're the word of God the Father, From before the world began; Every star and every planet Has been fashioned by Your hand. All creation holds together By the power of Your voice: Let the skies declare Your glory, Let the land and seas rejoice!


[Verse 2] 
You're the Author of creation, You're the Lord of every man; And Your cry of love rings out Across the lands.


[Verse 3] 
Yet You left the gaze of angels, Came to seek and save the lost, And exchanged the joy of heaven For the anguish of a cross. With a prayer You fed the hungry, With a word You stilled the sea; Yet how silently You suffered That the guilty may go free.


[Verse 4] 
You're the Author of creation, You're the Lord of every man; And Your cry of love rings out Across the lands.


[Verse 5] 
With a shout You rose victorious, Wresting victory from the grave, And ascended into heaven Leading captives in Your wake. Now You stand before the Father Interceding for Your own. From each tribe and tongue and nation You are leading sinners home.


[Verse 6] 
You're the Author of creation, You're the Lord of every man; And Your cry of love rings out Across the lands.
