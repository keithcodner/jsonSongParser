[Verse 1] 
Let the righteous sing, Come let the righteous dance, Rejoice before your God, Be happy and joyful, Give Him your praise. We give You our praise. ||Shout for joy to God Who rides upon the clouds, How awesome are His deeds, So great is His power. Give Him your praise. We give You our praise.


[Verse 2] 
He gives the desolate a home, He leads the prisoners out with singing. Father to the fatherless, Defender of the widow Is God in His holy place.
