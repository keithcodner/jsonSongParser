[Verse 1] 
My heart, I want to give You my heart, In service to the Lord, the One who cares To ask for my life. ||Take me, Mould my life and make me Into a child who longs to stay by Your side And learn of Your ways.


[Verse 2] 
For when I sought You, Lord, You heard me, You delivered me from fear; And by Your grace and mercy You have brought us both so near. ||I want to kneel before Your feet, Lord, And to gaze upon Your face; For the God who asks for my life Loves me completely and always.
