[Verse 1] 
I lift my hands, I raise my voice, I give my heart to You, my Lord, And I rejoice. ||There are many, many, reasons why I do the things I do, O, but most of all I praise You, Most of all I praise You, Jesus, most of all I praise You because You're You.


[Verse 2] 
I lift my hands, I raise my voice, I give my life to You, my Lord, And I rejoice. ||There are many, many, reasons why I do the things I do, O, but most of all I love You, Most of all I love You, Jesus, most of all I love You because You're You.


[Verse 3] 
I lift my hands, I raise my voice, I give my love to You, my Lord, And I rejoice. ||There are many, many, reasons why I do the things I do, O, but most of all I love You, Most of all I love You, Jesus, most of all I love You because You're You.
