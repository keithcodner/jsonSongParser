[Verse 1] 
[F]Just a face in the [Am]city. [C]Just a tear on a crowded [F]street. [F]But you are one in a [Am]million, [C]And you belong to [Dm]Me.


[Verse 2] 
And I [Ab]want you to [Bb]know That I'm [Ab]not letting [Bb]go, [Ab]Even when [Bb]you come un[F]done.


[Verse 3] 
You [Dm]Shine for [C/E]Me. You Shine for [C]Me. [Dm]Shine on. [C/E]Shine on. You [Ab]Shine for [Bb]Me.


[Verse 4] 
I love you [D]more than the sun And the [G]stars that I taught how to [Bm]shine. You are mine, and you [G]shine for me too.|| I love [D]you yesterday and to[G]day And tomorrow, I'll [Bm]say it again and [A]again:|| I love you [D]more than the sun And the [G]stars that I taught how to [Bm]shine. You are mine, and you [G]shine for me too.|| I love [D]you yesterday and to[G]day, Through the joy and the [Bm]pain, I'll say it again and [A]again:


[Verse 5] 
I love yo[G]u [Bm]more[D]. I love yo[G]u [Bm]more[D].|| [G]And I [Bm]see you[D], And I made you, [G] And I [Bm]love you[D] more than you can [G]imagi[Bm]ne,[D] more than you can [G]fath[Bm]om. [D]I love you more than [G]the[Bm] [D]sun, and you shine [G]for [Bm]... [D]me.
