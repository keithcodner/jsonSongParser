[Verse 1] 
It was on a starry night When the hills were bright, Earth lay sleeping, Sleeping calm and still; Then in a cattle shed, In a manger bed A boy was born, King of all the world.


[Verse 2] 
And all the angels sang for Him, The bells of heaven rang for Him; For a boy was born, King of all the world. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Soon the shepherds came that way, Where the baby lay, And were kneeling, Kneeling by His side. And their hearts believed again, For the peace of men; For a boy was born, King of all the world. 


[Verse 4] 
And all the angels sang for Him, The bells of heaven rang for Him; For a boy was born, King of all the world. (Repeat)
