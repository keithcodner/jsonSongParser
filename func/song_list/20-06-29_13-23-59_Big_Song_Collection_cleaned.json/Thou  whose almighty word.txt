[Verse 1] 
Thou, whose almighty word Chaos and darkness heard, And took their flight; Hear us, we humbly pray, And where the gospel-day Sheds not its glorious ray, Let there be light!


[Verse 2] 
Thou who didst come to bring, On Thy redeeming wing, Healing and sight; Health to the sick in mind, Sight to the inly blind, O now to all mankind Let there be light!


[Verse 3] 
Spirit of truth and love, Life-giving, holy Dove, Speed forth Thy flight; Move on the waters' face, Bearing the lamp of grace, And in earth's darkest place Let there be light!


[Verse 4] 
Blessed and holy Three, Glorious Trinity, Wisdom, love, might; Boundless as ocean's tide Rolling in fullest pride, Through the world far and wide Let there be light!
