[Verse 1] 
Our God is awesome in power, Scatters His enemies; Our God is mighty in bringing The powerful to their knees. He has put on His armour, He is prepared for war; Mercy and justice triumph When the Lion of Judah roars.


[Verse 2] 
The Lord is a warrior, We will march with Him. The Lord is a warrior, Leading us to win. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Waken the warrior spirit, Army of God, arise; Challenge the powers of darkness, There must be no compromise. We shall attack their strongholds, Our hands are trained for war; We shall advance the kingdom, For the victory belongs to God. 


[Verse 4] 
The Lord is a warrior, We will march with Him. The Lord is a warrior, Leading us to win. (Repeat)
