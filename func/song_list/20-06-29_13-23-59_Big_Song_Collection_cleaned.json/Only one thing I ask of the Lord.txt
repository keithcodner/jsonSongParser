[Verse 1] 
Only one thing I ask of the Lord: Only one thing do I desire: That I may dwell, may dwell in God's house All of the days of my life, All of the days of my life.


[Verse 2] 
Even when days of trouble may come, I will be safe if God is my home, For I will hide in the shelter of love All of the days of my life, All of the days of my life.


[Verse 3] 
I'll gaze on His beauty, And sing of His glory; While I have life within me, What more could I need?


[Verse 4] 
(Descant) I'll sing to His holy name, Forever He is the same, His faithfulness never change, Let all of the earth proclaim, All of the days of my life.
