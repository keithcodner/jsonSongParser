[Verse 1] 
My hope rests firm on Jesus Christ, He is my only plea: Though all the world should point and scorn, His ransom leaves me free, His ransom leaves me free.


[Verse 2] 
My hope sustains me as I strive And strain towards the goal; Though I still stumble into sin, His death paid for it all, His death paid for it all.


[Verse 3] 
My hope provides me with a spur To help me run this race: I know my tears will turn to joy The day I see His face, The day I see His face.


[Verse 4] 
My hope is to be with my Lord, To know as I am known: To serve Him gladly all my days In praise before His throne, In praise before His throne.
