[Verse 1] 
I behold Your power and glory, Bring an offering, come before You; Worship You, Lord, In the beauty of Your holiness. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Whenever I call, You're there, Redeemer and Friend; Cherished beyond all words, This love never ends. Morning by morning Your mercy awakens my soul.


[Verse 3] 
I lift up my eyes to see The wonders of heaven Opening over me, Your goodness abounds; You've taken my breath away With Your irresistible love.
