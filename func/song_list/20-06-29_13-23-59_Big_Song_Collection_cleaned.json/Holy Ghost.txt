[Verse 1] 
Holy Ghost, You wonderful Holy Ghost, A wind blowing strong, Blowing from heaven. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
We have decided to go All the way with our God. Revival in the land, that's our goal; As soldiers in His army We'll fight with heart and soul.


[Verse 3] 
Blood and fire, We call upon blood and fire, A wind blowing strong, Blowing from heaven. (Repeat)
