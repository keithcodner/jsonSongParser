[Verse 1] 
O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth. O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth.


[Verse 2] 
You have set Your glory above the heavens, From children's lips You have ordained praise; You have set the moon and the stars inplace, And You still remember me.


[Verse 3] 
O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth. O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth.


[Verse 4] 
What is man that You are mindful of him; The son of man that You take care of him? You have put everything beneath his feet, And made him ruler of Your works. 


[Verse 5] 
O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth. O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth.
