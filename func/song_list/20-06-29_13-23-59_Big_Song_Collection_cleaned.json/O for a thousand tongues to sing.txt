[Verse 1] 
O for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeemer's praise, My great Redeemer's praise! The glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace!


[Verse 2] 
Jesus! the name that charms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease, That bids our sorrows cease; 'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'Tis life, and health, and peace.


[Verse 3] 
See all your sins on Jesus laid; The Lamb of God was slain, The Lamb of God was slain; His soul was once an offering made For every soul of man.


[Verse 4] 
He breaks the power of cancelled sin, He sets the prisoner free, He sets the prisoner free; His blood can make the foulest clean, His blood availed for me.


[Verse 5] 
He speaks and, listening to His voice, New life the dead receive, New life the dead receive; The mournful, broken hearts rejoice, The humble poor believe.


[Verse 6] 
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb, Your loosened tongues employ, Your loosened tongues employ; Ye blind, behold your Saviour come; And leap, ye lame, for joy!


[Verse 7] 
My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim, Assist me to proclaim, To spread through all the earth abroad The honours of Thy name.
