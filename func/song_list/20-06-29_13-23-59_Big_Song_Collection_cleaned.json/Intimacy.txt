[Verse 1] 
One [Esus4]thing my heart is [E]set upon, One [Esus4]thing that I would [E]ask: To [Esus4]know you, Lord, as [E]close as one Could [Esus4]hope to on this [E]earth.


[Verse 2] 
[E/A]Intima[B]cy, O Jesus, [E/A]Intim[B]acy. My [E/A]treasure will [B]be, O Jesus, Your [E/A]intima[B]cy.


[Verse 3] 
To look upon Your beauty, Lord, Your glory and Your heart; To know You close and closer still Each day upon this earth


[Verse 4] 
Lord, since the day I saw You first, My soul was satisfied; And yet because I see in part, I'm searching more to find.
