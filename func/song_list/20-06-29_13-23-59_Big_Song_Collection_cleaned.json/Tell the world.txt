[Verse 1] 
Tell the world that Jesus is risen, Let His praise encircle the globe; Make it known among all the nations That Jesus is alive!


[Verse 2] 
From the cradle to the grave, From a stable to a cross, His life was offered up in sacrifice for us. He came from heaven's throne To seek and save the lost; To reconcile us back to God.


[Verse 3] 
Tell the world that Jesus is risen, Let His praise encircle the globe; Make it known among all the nations That Jesus is alive!


[Verse 4] 
No eye has seen, no ear has heard what He's prepared; His resurrection means His life is ours to share. The greatest miracle of all has taken place; Christ is risen, He is Lord!


[Verse 5] 
Tell the world that Jesus is risen, Let His praise encircle the globe; Make it known among all the nations That Jesus is alive!
