[Verse 1] 
You pour out grace on the broken-hearted, And You lift the hope of the weary soul, And You stretch out Your hand With Your loving mercy. ||You saw this heart that was lost and broken, And You felt the pain of my loneliness, And You befriended me And restored my dignity.


[Verse 2] 
You alone revealed the love of God to me, And You alone have given everything for me; And You alone deserve the highest praise, Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
You demonstrated the life of love to me, And how it was that You wanted me to live: Heart of compassion and hands of healing. ||I need Your Spirit to help accomplish this: Abundant grace and Your strength in weakness, And the steady hand of the Father holding me.


[Verse 4] 
You alone revealed the love of God to me, And You alone have given everything for me; And You alone deserve the highest praise, Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
And You have given me great salvation, And You have given me hope eternal, And every day I will look to give You All the glory that's due Your name.


[Verse 6] 
You alone revealed the love of God to me, And You alone have given everything for me; And You alone deserve the highest praise, Jesus.
