[Verse 1] 
This is my beloved son Who tasted death That you, my child, might live. See the blood He shed for you, What suffering! ||Say what more could He give? Clothed in His perfection, Bring praise, a fragrance sweet, Garlanded with joy, Come worship at His feet:


[Verse 2] 
This is my beloved son Who tasted death That you, my child, might live. See the blood He shed for you, What suffering! ||Say what more could He give? Clothed in His perfection, Bring praise, a fragrance sweet, Garlanded with joy, Come worship at His feet:


[Verse 3] 
Look, the world's great harvest fields Are ready now, And Christ commands us: 'Go!' Countless souls are dying So hopelessly, ||His wondrous love unknown. Lord, give us the nations For the glory of the King. Father, send more labourers, The lost to gather in.


[Verse 4] 
This is my beloved son Who tasted death That you, my child, might live. See the blood He shed for you, What suffering! ||Say what more could He give? Clothed in His perfection, Bring praise, a fragrance sweet, Garlanded with joy, Come worship at His feet:


[Verse 5] 
Come the day when we will stand There face to face, What joy will fill His eyes. For at last His Bride appears, So beautiful, ||Her glory fills the skies. Drawn from every nation, People, tribe and tongue; All creation sings, The wedding has begun.


[Verse 6] 
Look, the world's great harvest fields Are ready now, And Christ commands us: 'Go!' Countless souls are dying So hopelessly, ||His wondrous love unknown. Lord, give us the nations For the glory of the King. Father, send more labourers, The lost to gather in.


[Verse 7] 
That the Lamb who was slain Might receive the reward, Might receive the reward of His suffering.


[Verse 8] 
And the Lamb who was slain Shall receive the reward, Shall receive the reward of His suffering.
