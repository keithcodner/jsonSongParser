[Verse 1] 
[A]I love the way, I love the way you [E]carry on. You [F#m]make me wanna say, You make me wanna sing another [D/F#]love song. Sing another [A]love song, Sing another [E]love song, Sing another [F#m]love song to [D/F#]you.


[Verse 2] 
[A]Bury my head for the shame,|you pick me up, you say I [E]look like you. Though it [F#m]makes no sense to me,|You make me believe that I could [D/F#]trust someone. I could ever [A]trust someone,|I could ever [E]trust someone, I could ever [F#m]trust someone,|I could ever [D/F#]trust someone.


[Verse 3] 
Sing another [A]love song. Sing another [E]love song. Sing another [F#m]love song. Sing another [D/F#]love song.


[Verse 4] 
I [A]walk through flame, I touch the fire, You know that I still [E]burn for You. [F#m]Flood water, rain crash down, soak the ground, Still I [D/F#]thirst for you. Still I thirst for [A]you.


[Verse 5] 
Sing another [A]love song. Sing another [E]love song. Though it [F#m]makes no sense to me, You [D/F#]make me wanna sing, Make me wanna [A]sing...


[Verse 6] 
Sing another [A]love song. Sing another [E]love song. Sing another [F#m]love song. Sing another [D/F#]love song.


[Verse 7] 
I just [D/F#]wanna trust someone.[A]
