[Verse 1] 
Open up the gates of heaven. Open up the gates of heaven. Open up the gates of heaven. Open up the gates of heaven,


[Verse 2] 
And let Your river flow, And let new mercies fall like rain; Oh, let me know Your presence. You are all I need; Let all earthly passion fade away,


[Verse 3] 
('Cause) all I want is to know You more. All I want is to meet with You in this place. All I want is to be with You, To feel Your embrace.
