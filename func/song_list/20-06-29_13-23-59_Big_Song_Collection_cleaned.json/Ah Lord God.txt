[Verse 1] 
Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens And the earth by Thy great power. Ah Lord God, Thou hast made the heavens And the earth by Thine Outstretched arm.


[Verse 2] 
Nothing is too difficult for Thee, Nothing is too difficult for Thee. O great and mighty God, Great in counsel and mighty in deed, Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing, Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
