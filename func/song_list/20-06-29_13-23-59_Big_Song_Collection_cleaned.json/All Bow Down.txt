Praise awaits You at the dawn when the world comes alive. Praise awaits You in the darkness and shines in the light. Praise awaits You with a song of love and desire, Love and desire.

[Verse 4] 
You are coming again like a thief in the night. You are coming again with a shout from the sky. You are coming again to take away Your bride, To take away Your bride.

Here [A2]comes the King; all [E]bow down. Lift up your [B/D#]voices unto the Lamb. He is [A2]the King; all [E]bow down. All [B/D#]bow down.
