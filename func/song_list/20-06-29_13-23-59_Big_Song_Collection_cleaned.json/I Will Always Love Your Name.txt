[Verse 1] 
[E2]Here I am, and I have come to thank You, Lord, for all You've d[A]one; Thank You, [E2]Lord. You [E2]paid the price at Calvary, You shed Your blood, You set me [A]free; Thank You, [E2]Lord. No [B7sus4]greater love was [E2]ever shown, no [B7sus4]better life ever [A]was laid [E2]down.[(B2)]


[Verse 2] 
And [E2]I will always love Your [A]name; And [B7sus4]I will always sing Your [E2]praise.[(B] x[first]2[time][only)]


[Verse 3] 
You took my sin, You took my shame, You drank my cup, You bore my pain; Thank You, Lord. You broke the curse, You broke the chains, In victory from death You rose again; Thank You, Lord. And not by works, but by Your grace You clothe me now in Your righteousness.


[Verse 4] 
You bid me come, You make me whole, You give me peace, You restore my soul; Thank You, Lord. You fill my cup and when I'm full You give me more 'till I overflow; Thank You, Lord. You're making me to be like You, To do the works of the Father too.
