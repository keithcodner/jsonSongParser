[Verse 1] 
Make me a channel of Your peace. Where there is hatred Let me bring Your love; Where there is injury, Your pardon, Lord; And where there's doubt, True faith in You.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, Master, grant That I may never seek So much to be consoled As to console; To be understood As to understand; To be loved as to love With all my soul.


[Verse 3] 
Make me a channel of Your peace. Where there's despair in life Let me bring hope; Where there is darkness, Only light; And where there's sadness, Ever joy.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, Master, grant That I may never seek So much to be consoled As to console; To be understood As to understand; To be loved as to love With all my soul.


[Verse 5] 
Make me a channel of Your peace. It is in pardoning That we are pardoned, In giving to all men That we receive, And in dying that we're Born to eternal life. 


[Verse 6] 
Oh, Master, grant That I may never seek So much to be consoled As to console; To be understood As to understand; To be loved as to love With all my soul.
