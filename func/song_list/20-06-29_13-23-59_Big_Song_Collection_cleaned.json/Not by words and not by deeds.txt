[Verse 1] 
Not by words and not by deeds, But by grace we have been saved; And it is the gift of God, the faith we need. Not by strength and not by might, But with power from on high, So that we can only boast, boast in You.


[Verse 2] 
For once I was dead, now I'm alive, For freedom I'm set free; And in Your great love, life do I find. You opened up my eyes.


[Verse 3] 
Not with eloquence or fame, But in weakness and in shame, For the power of Your strength is then revealed. And the message of Your cross, Seemed such foolishness to some, But the mercy of Your grace is hidden there.


[Verse 4] 
For once I was dead, now I'm alive, For freedom I'm set free; And in Your great love, life do I find. You opened up my eyes.
