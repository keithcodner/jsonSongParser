[Verse 1] 
He was pierced for our transgressions, And bruised for our iniquities; And to bring us peace He was punished, And by His stripes we are healed.


[Verse 2] 
He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, Although He was innocent of crime; And cut off from the land of the living, He paid for the guilt that was mine.


[Verse 3] 
We like sheep have gone astray, Turned each one to his own way, And the Lord has laid on Him The iniquity of us all.
