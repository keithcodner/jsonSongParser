[Verse 1] 
[D]You give me joy that's unsp[A]eakable And I l[Em]ike it, and I [G]like it. [D]Your love for me's irre[A]stible; I can't [Em]fight it, I can't [G]fight it.


[Verse 2] 
If life is water, I was d[G]ry as the Tucson [A]dirt. If it's a gamble, I'd alre[G]ady lost my sh[A]irt.|| If it's a journey, I was da[G]zed without a c[A]lue. I flipped a "U" back to the [G]first love I ever [A]knew.


[Verse 3] 
[D]You give me joy that's unsp[A]eakable And I [Em]like it, and I [G]like it. [D]Your love for me's irre[A]stible; I can't [Em]fight it, I can't [G]fight it.|| [D]You carried the cross and t[A]ook my shame; I be[Em]lieve it, I be[G]lieve it. [D]You shine your light of am[A]azing grace; I re[Em]ceive it, I re[G]ceive it.


[Verse 4] 
If life's a battle, the inv[G]asion is comp[A]lete. If it's a rhythm, I have fou[G]nd the perfect b[A]eat.|| If it's a Renaissance, I've [G]got a new birth[A]day. The world don't g[G]ive it and the world can't take it a[A]way.


[Verse 5] 
[D]You give me joy that's unsp[A]eakable And I [Em]like it, and I [G]like it. [D]Your love for me's irre[A]stible; I can't [Em]fight it, I can't [G]fight it.|| [D]You carried the cross and t[A]ook my shame; I be[Em]lieve it, I be[G]lieve it. [D]You shine your light of am[A]azing grace; I re[Em]ceive it, I re[G]ceive it.


[Verse 6] 
[Em]I'm bowed and broken, eve[A]rything's new. [Em]All that I need, you're like w[A]ater to seed.|| And how your love rights eve[G]rything wrong, In my wea[A]kness you're ever st[G]ronger, Pulling me back where I be[A]long.


[Verse 7] 
[D]You give me joy that's unsp[A]eakable And I [Em]like it, and I [G]like it. [D]Your love for me's irre[A]stible; I can't [Em]fight it, I can't [G]fight it.|| [D]You carried the cross and t[A]ook my shame; I be[Em]lieve it, I be[G]lieve it. [D]You shine your light of am[A]azing grace; I re[Em]ceive it, I re[G]ceive it.


[Verse 8] 
[D]You give me joy that's unsp[A]eakable And I [Em]like it, and I [G]like it. [D]Your love for me's irre[A]stible; I can't [Em]fight it, I can't [G]fight it.|| [D]You carried the cross and t[A]ook my shame; I be[Em]lieve it, I be[G]lieve it. [D]You shine your light of am[A]azing grace; I re[Em]ceive it, I re[G]ceive it.
