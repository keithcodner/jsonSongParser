[Verse 1] 
We bow our hearts, We bend our knees; O Spirit, come make us humble. We turn our eyes from evil things; O Lord, we cast down our idols.


[Verse 2] 
Give us clean hands, Give us pure hearts; Let us not lift our souls to another. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
O God, let us be A generation that seeks, That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob. (Repeat)
