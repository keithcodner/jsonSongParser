[Verse 1] 
Lord, we long for You to move in power; There's a hunger deep within our hearts, To see healing in our nation. Send Your Spirit to revive us:


[Verse 2] 
Heal our nation, Heal our nation, Heal our nation, Pour out Your Spirit on this land.


[Verse 3] 
Lord we hear Your Spirit, coming closer, A mighty wave to break upon our land, Bringing justice, and forgiveness. God we cry to You, 'Revive us': 


[Verse 4] 
Heal our nation, Heal our nation, Heal our nation, Pour out Your Spirit on this land.
