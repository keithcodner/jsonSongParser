[Verse 1] 
I am [Cm]a thief, I am a [Gm]murderer Walking up[F] this lonely h[Cm]ill. What have [Cm]I done? I don't remem[Gm]ber. No one kn[F]ows just how I feel[Cm]. And I k[G]now that my [Bb]time is com[Cm]ing soon.


[Verse 2] 
It's bee[Cm]n so long. O[Gm]h, such a long time Sin[F]ce I've lived with[Cm] peace and rest. Now I a[Cm]m here, at my destin[Gm]ation. Guess t[F]hings work for t[Gm]he best. And I k[G]now that my [Bb]time is com[Cm]ing soon.


[Verse 3] 
Who is thi[Cm]s man? Thi[Gm]s man beside me They [F]call the King o[Cm]f the Jews. They do[Cm]n't believe th[Gm]at he's the Messiah, But s[F]omehow I know tha[Cm]t it's true.


[Verse 4] 
And th[G]ey laugh at Him in mockery And be[Bb]at him till [Cm]He bleeds. They n[G]ail Him to the rugged cross, And rai[Bb]se Him, they [F]raise him up[Cm] next to me.


[Verse 5] 
My time has [Cm]come. I'm slowly f[Gm]ading, But I [F]deserve what [Cm]I receive. Jesus, wh[Cm]en you are in Your[Gm] Kingdom Could Y[F]ou please remem[Cm]ber me?


[Verse 6] 
And He look[G]s at me still holding on. The tea[Bb]rs fall from His ey[Cm]es. He sa[G]ys, "I tell the truth: [Bb]Today, you wi[F]ll be with Me i[Cm]n paradise."


[Verse 7] 
And I [G]know that [Eb]my time is coming[Cm] soon. And I [G]know that [Eb]my time is coming[Cm] soon. And I [G]know that [Bb]paradise, paradise is coming [Cm]soon.
