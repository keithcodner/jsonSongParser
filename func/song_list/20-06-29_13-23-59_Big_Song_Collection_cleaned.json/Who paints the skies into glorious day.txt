[Verse 1] 
Who paints the skies into glorious day? Only the splendour of Jesus. Who breathes His life into fists of clay? Only the splendour of Jesus. ||Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain? Only the splendour of Jesus. Who makes the desert to live again? Only the splendour of Jesus. 


[Verse 2] 
Teach every nation His marvellous ways; Each generation shall sing His praise.


[Verse 3] 
He is wonderful, He is glorious, Clothed in righteousness, Full of tenderness. Come and worship Him, He's the Prince of life, He will cleanse our hearts In His river of fire.


[Verse 4] 
Who hears the cry of the barren one? Only the mercy of Jesus. Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone? Only the mercy of Jesus. ||Who storms the prison and sets men free, Only the mercy of Jesus. Purchasing souls for eternity? Only the mercy of Jesus. 


[Verse 5] 
Teach every nation His marvellous ways; Each generation shall sing His praise.


[Verse 6] 
He is wonderful, He is glorious, Clothed in righteousness, Full of tenderness. Come and worship Him, He's the Prince of life, He will cleanse our hearts In His river of fire.
