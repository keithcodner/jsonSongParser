[Verse 1] 
How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him Who brings good news, good news, Proclaiming peace, announcing news of happiness, Our God reigns, our God reigns.


[Verse 2] 
Our God reigns, our God reigns, Our God reigns, our God reigns.


[Verse 3] 
You watchmen lift your voices joyfully as one, Shout for your King, your King. See eye to eye the Lord restoring Zion: Your God reigns, your God reigns!


[Verse 4] 
Our God reigns, our God reigns, Our God reigns, our God reigns.


[Verse 5] 
Waste places of Jerusalem break forth with joy, We are redeemed, redeemed. The Lord has saved and comforted His people: Your God reigns, your God reigns!


[Verse 6] 
Our God reigns, our God reigns, Our God reigns, our God reigns.


[Verse 7] 
Ends of the earth, see the salvation of your God, Jesus is Lord, is Lord. Before the nations He has bared His holy arm: Your God reigns, your God reigns! 


[Verse 8] 
Our God reigns, our God reigns, Our God reigns, our God reigns.
