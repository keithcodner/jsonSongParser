[Verse 1] 
There is a redeemer, Jesus, God's own Son, Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.


[Verse 2] 
Thank You, O my Father, For giving us Your Son, And leaving Your Spirit Till the work on earth is done.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus my Redeemer, Name above all names, Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, O for sinners slain.


[Verse 4] 
Thank You, O my Father, For giving us Your Son, And leaving Your Spirit Till the work on earth is done.


[Verse 5] 
When I stand in glory I will see His face, And there I'll serve my King forever In that holy place. 


[Verse 6] 
Thank You, O my Father, For giving us Your Son, And leaving Your Spirit Till the work on earth is done.
