[Verse 1] 
I will enter Your house with thanksgiving, I will sing of Your goodness to me. For my heart is eternally grateful, I am blessed abundantly.


[Verse 2] 
You have given me life in all its fullness, And joy no words can describe. But I know it's for more than me, It's for those, those You sent me to reach.


[Verse 3] 
I am blessed, blessed to be a blessing, I am blessed, I live under an open heaven, Blessed, that all may see It's Christ, Christ in me. (Repeat)
