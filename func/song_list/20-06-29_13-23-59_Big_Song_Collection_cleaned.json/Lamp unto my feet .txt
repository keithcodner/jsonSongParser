[Verse 1] 
Lamp unto my feet, Light unto my path, It is You, Jesus, it is You. This treasure that I hold, More than finest gold, It is You, Jesus, it is You.


[Verse 2] 
With all my heart, with all my soul, I live to worship You And praise forevermore, Praise forevermore. Lord, every day I need You more, On wings of heaven I will soar With You.


[Verse 3] 
You take my brokenness, Call me to Yourself. There You stand, Healing in Your hands.


[Verse 4] 
With all my heart, with all my soul, I live to worship You And praise forevermore, Praise forevermore. Lord, every day I need You more, On wings of heaven I will soar With You.
