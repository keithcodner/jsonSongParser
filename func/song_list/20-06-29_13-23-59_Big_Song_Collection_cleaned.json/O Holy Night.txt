[Verse 2] 
[F]O holy night, the [Bb]stars are brightly s[F]hining It is the night of our [C]dear Saviour's [F]birth [F]Long lay the world in [Bb]sin and error p[F]ining Til He ap[Am]peared and the [E7]soul felt its [Am]worth A [C]thrill of hope the [F]weary world rejoices For[C] yonder breaks, a[F] new and glorious morn [Dm]Fall on your k[Am]nees, oh [Gm]hear the angel [Dm]voices O [F]nig[C]ht di[F]vin[Bb]e O [F]nigh[C]t when Christ was[F] born O [C]night, O[F] h[Gm]oly n[F]ight,[C] O night div[F]ine


[Verse 3] 
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming Here came the wise men from Orient land The King of Kings, lay thus in lowly manger In all our trials born to be our friend He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger Behold, your king Before Him lowly bend Behold, your king before Him lowly bend


[Verse 4] 
Truly He taught us to love one another His law is love, and His gospel is peace Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother And in His name all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we Let all within us praise His holy name Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever His power and glory ever more proclaim
