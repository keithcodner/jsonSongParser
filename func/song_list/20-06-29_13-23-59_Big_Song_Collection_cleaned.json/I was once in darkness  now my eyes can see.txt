[Verse 1] 
I was once in darkness, now my eyes can see, I was lost but Jesus sought and found me. O what love He offers, O what peace He gives, I will sing forever more, He lives.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah Jesus! Hallelujah Lord! Hallelujah Father, I am shielded by Hisword. I will live forever, I will never die, I will rise up to meet Him in the sky.
