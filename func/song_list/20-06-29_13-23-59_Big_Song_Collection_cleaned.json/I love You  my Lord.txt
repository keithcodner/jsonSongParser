[Verse 1] 
I love You, my Lord, For giving to me Your great salvation, Setting me free from sin and death And the kingdom of Satan's destruction. ||There's power in the blood To cleanse all my sin, I know I'm forgiven; I'm reigning in life, I'm living by faith, I'm now united with Christ.


[Verse 2] 
I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord, Jesus is Lord, and believe in my heart He's been raised from the dead. I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord, Jesus is Lord, and now I have life, Now I have life by the Spirit of God.


[Verse 3] 
I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord, And believe in my heart He's been raised from the dead. I confess with my mouth that Jesus is my Lord, And now I have life by the Spirit of God.
