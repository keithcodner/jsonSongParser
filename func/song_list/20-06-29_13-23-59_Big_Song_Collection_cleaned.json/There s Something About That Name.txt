[Verse 1] 
[D]Jesus, Jesus, [Dm7]Je[D7]sus: There’s just [G]something a[Gm]bout that [D]Name; [D]Master, Saviour, [Dm7]Je[D7]sus: Like the [E7]fragrance after the [Em7]rain;[A7]


[Verse 2] 
[D]Jesus, Jesus, [Dm7]Je[D7]sus: Let all [G]heaven and earth pro[F#sus]claim;[F#7] [B]Kings and [B7]kingdoms shall [E7]all pass away, But there’s [Em7]something a[A7]bout that [D]Name.
