[Verse 1] 
May I sing a song of love To the One who saved my soul? May I bow my head today In the presence of the King?


[Verse 2] 
You have called and I will come, Lift my hands up to Your throne; Worship You on holy ground - That's what I long to do.


[Verse 3] 
Draw me near into Your heart. All I have is broken love, And a thirst that cries for more. Draw me near to You.
