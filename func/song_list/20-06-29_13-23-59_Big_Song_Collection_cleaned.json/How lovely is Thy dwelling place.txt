[Verse 1] 
How lovely is Thy dwelling place, O Lord of hosts, My soul longs and yearns for Your courts, And my heart and flesh sing for joy To the living God. ||One day in Your presence Is far better to me than gold, Or to live my whole life somewhere else; And I would rather be A doorkeeper in Your house Than to take my fate upon myself. ||You are my sun and my shield, You are my lover from the start, And the highway to Your city Runs through my heart.
