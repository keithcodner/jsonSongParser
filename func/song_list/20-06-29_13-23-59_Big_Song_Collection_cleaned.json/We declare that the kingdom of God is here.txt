[Verse 1] 
We declare that the kingdom of God is here, We declare that the kingdom of God is here, Among you, among you. (Men and women in canon)


[Verse 2] 
We declare that the kingdom of God is here (Men) We declare that the kingdom of God is here (Women) We declare that the (Men) Kingdom of God is here. (All)


[Verse 3] 
The blind see, the deaf hear, The lame men are walking; Sicknesses flee at His voice. The dead live again, And the poor hear the good news: Jesus is King, so rejoice!
