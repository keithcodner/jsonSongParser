[Verse 1] 
[G]Standing on the promises of Christ, my King! [C]Through eternal ages let His [G]praises ring; [G]"Glory in the highest!" I will shout and sing, Standing on the [Am]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 2] 
[G]Standing on the promises that cannot fail, [C]When the howling storms of doubt and [G]fears assail, [G]By the living Word of God I shall prevail, Standing on the [Am]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 3] 
[G]Standing on the promises, I now can see [C]Perfect, present cleansing in the [G]blood for me; [G]Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free, Standing on the [Am]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 4] 
[G]Standing, [C]stan[Em]ding, [D]Standing on the promises of [G]Christ my [C]Sav[G]iour; Standing, [C]standing I'm [G]standing on the [Dsus]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 5] 
[G]Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord, [C]Bound to Him eternally by [G]love's strong cord, [G]Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword, Standing on the [Am]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 6] 
[G]Standing, [C]stan[Em]ding, [D]Standing on the promises of [G]Christ my [C]Sav[G]iour; Standing, [C]standing I'm [G]standing on the [Dsus]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 7] 
[G]Standing on the promises, I cannot fall, [C]List'ning every moment to the [G]Spirit's call, [G]Resting in my Saviour as my All-in-All, Standing on the [Am]promi[D]ses of [G]God.


[Verse 8] 
[G]Standing, [C]stan[Em]ding, [D]Standing on the promises of [G]Christ my [C]Sav[G]iour; Standing, [C]standing I'm [G]standing on the [Dsus]promi[D]ses of [G]God.
