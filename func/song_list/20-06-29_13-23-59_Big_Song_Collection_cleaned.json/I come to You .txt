[Verse 1] 
I come to You, Lord of all hope, Giver of life, revive my soul. I wait for You, Prince of all peace, King of all love, draw near to me. It feels sometimes like You're far away, Yet I know You are with me.


[Verse 2] 
I come to You, Lord of all hope, Giver of life, revive my soul. I wait for You, Prince of all peace, King of all love, draw near to me. It feels sometimes like You're far away, Yet I know You are with me.


[Verse 3] 
Come to me now, Lord of my heart, I need to know unfailing love. Consuming flame, passion and power, Come let Your fire burn in me now. It feels sometimes like You're far away, Yet I know You are with me. 


[Verse 4] 
I come to You, Lord of all hope, Giver of life, revive my soul. I wait for You, Prince of all peace, King of all love, draw near to me. It feels sometimes like You're far away, Yet I know You are with me.


[Verse 5] 
Come to me now, Lord of my heart, I need to know unfailing love. Consuming flame, passion and power, Come let Your fire burn in me now. It feels sometimes like You're far away, Yet I know You are with me. 


[Verse 6] 
And I know I cannot go from Your presence, O Lord, But I need to feel You here with me. What can I do just to draw near to You? Oh, I need to know You here with me now.


[Verse 7] 
Where can I go just to find You, O God? Oh, I long to feel You holding me. Know that I seek You with all of my heart. Oh, I need to find You here with me now.
