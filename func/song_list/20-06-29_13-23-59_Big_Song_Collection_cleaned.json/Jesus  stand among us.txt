[Verse 1] 
Jesus, stand among us At the meeting of our lives; Be our sweet agreement At the meeting of our eyes. O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here; Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.


[Verse 2] 
So to You we're gathering Out of each and every land; Christ the love between us At the joining of our hands. O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here; Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, stand among us At the breaking of the bread; Join us as one body As we worship You, our Head. O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here; Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.
