[Verse 1] 
How wonderful, how glorious Is the love of God, Bringing healing, forgiveness, Wonderful love.


[Verse 2] 
Let celebration echo through this land; We bring reconciliation, We bring hope to every man:


[Verse 3] 
How wonderful, how glorious Is the love of God, Bringing healing, forgiveness, Wonderful love.


[Verse 4] 
We proclaim the kingdom Of our God is here; Come and join the heavenly anthem, Ringing loud and ringing clear:


[Verse 5] 
How wonderful, how glorious Is the love of God, Bringing healing, forgiveness, Wonderful love.


[Verse 6] 
Listen to the music As His praises fill the air; With joy and with gladness Tell the people everywhere: 


[Verse 7] 
How wonderful, how glorious Is the love of God, Bringing healing, forgiveness, Wonderful love.
