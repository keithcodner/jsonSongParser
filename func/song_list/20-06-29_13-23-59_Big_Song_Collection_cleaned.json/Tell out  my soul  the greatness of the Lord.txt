[Verse 1] 
Tell out, my soul, The greatness of the Lord! Unnumbered blessings Give my spirit voice; Tender to me The promise of His word; In God my Saviour Shall my heart rejoice.


[Verse 2] 
Tell out, my soul, The greatness of His name! Make known His might, The deeds His arm has done; His mercy sure, From age to age the same; His holy name - The Lord, the mighty One.


[Verse 3] 
Tell out, my soul, The greatness of His might! Powers and dominions Lay their glory by; Proud hearts and stubborn wills Are put to flight, The hungry fed, The humble lifted high.


[Verse 4] 
Tell out, my soul, The glories of His word! Firm is His promise, And His mercy sure: Tell out, my soul, The greatness of the Lord To children's children And forever more!
