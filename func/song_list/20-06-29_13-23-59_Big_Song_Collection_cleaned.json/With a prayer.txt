[Verse 1] 
With a prayer You fed the hungry, With a cry You stilled the storm; With a look You had compassion On the desperate and forlorn. With a touch You healed the leper, With a shout You raised the dead; With a word expelled the demons, With a blessing broke the bread.


[Verse 2] 
Love incarnate, love divine, Captivate this heart of mine Till all I do speaks of You.


[Verse 3] 
As a sheep before the shearer You were silent in Your pain; You endured humiliation At the hands of those You'd made. And as hell unleashed its fury You were lifted on a tree, Crying 'Father God, forgive them, Place their punishment on Me.'


[Verse 4] 
Love incarnate, love divine, Captivate this heart of mine Till all I do speaks of You.


[Verse 5] 
I will feed the poor and hungry, I will stand up for the truth; I will take my cross and follow To the corners of the earth. And I ask that You so fill me With Your peace, Your power, Your breath, That I never love my life so much To shrink from facing death.


[Verse 6] 
Love incarnate, love divine, Captivate this heart of mine Till all I do speaks of You.
