[Verse 1] 
Take me to Your sacred place, How I long to see Your face. I'll be lost in Your embrace And be loved, and be loved by You.


[Verse 2] 
Take me where Your glory shines, Where Your holy fire burns. Purify this heart of mine, I surrender my life to You.


[Verse 3] 
Draw me, draw me To Your sacred place. Draw me, draw me Till I see Your face.
