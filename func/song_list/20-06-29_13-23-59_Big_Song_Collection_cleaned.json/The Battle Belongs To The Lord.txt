[Verse 1] 
In [Em]heavenly armor we'll [D]enter the [Em]land, The battle be[D]longs to the [Em]Lord; No [Em]weapon that's fashioned a[D]gainst us will [Em]stand, The battle be[D]longs to the [Em]Lord!


[Verse 2] 
[Em]We [D]sing [G]glo[D]ry, [C]ho[D]no[G]r, Power, and [D]strength to the [Em]Lord; [Em]We [D]sing [G]glo[D]ry, [C]ho[D]no[G]r, Power, and [D]strength to the [Em]Lord.


[Verse 3] 
When the [Em]power of darkness comes [D]in like a [Em]flood, The battle be[D]longs to the [Em]Lord; He's [Em]raised up a standard, the [D]power of His [Em]blood, The battle be[D]longs to the [Em]Lord!


[Verse 4] 
When your [Em]enemy presses in [D]hard do not [Em]fear, The battle be[D]longs to the [Em]Lord; Take [Em]courage, my friend, your re[D]demption is [Em]near, The battle be[D]longs to the [Em]Lord!
