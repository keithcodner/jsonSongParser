[Verse 1] 
Many are the words we speak, Many are the songs we sing; Many kinds of offerings, But now to live the life. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Help us live the life, Help us live the life. All we want to do Is bring You something real, Bring You something true. 


[Verse 3] 
(We hope that) Precious are the words we speak, (We pray that) Precious are the songs we sing; Precious all these offerings, But now to live the life.


[Verse 4] 
Help us live the life, Help us live the life. All we want to do Is bring You something real, Bring You something true. 


[Verse 5] 
Now to go the extra mile, Now to turn the other cheek, And to serve You with a life. Let us share Your fellowship, Even of Your sufferings; Never let the passion die. 


[Verse 6] 
Help us live the life, Help us live the life. All we want to do Is bring You something real, Bring You something true. 


[Verse 7] 
Now to live the life. Now to live the life. Now to live the life. Now to live the life. Now to live the life. Now to live the life.
