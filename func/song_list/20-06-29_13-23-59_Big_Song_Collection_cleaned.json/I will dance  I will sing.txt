[Verse 1] 
I will dance, I will sing, To be mad for my King. Nothing, Lord, is hindering The passion in my soul. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
And I'll become Even more undignified than this. (Some would say it's foolishness but) I'll become Even more undignified than this.


[Verse 3] 
Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey! Na, na, na, na, na, na! Hey! 


[Verse 4] 
And I'll become Even more undignified than this. (Some would say it's foolishness but) I'll become Even more undignified than this.
