[Verse 1] 
You are the fountain of my life And in Your light I find my reason, 'Cause Your love reaches to the stars, Even the great deep. And Your love reaches to this heart And it makes me sing.


[Verse 2] 
Your love reaches me: It's what I need, it's what I need. Your love reaches me: It's what I need, it's what I need.


[Verse 3] 
O Lord, how priceless Is Your unending love. Both high and low Find refuge in Your shadow. (Repeat) 


[Verse 4] 
Your love reaches me: It's what I need, it's what I need. Your love reaches me: It's what I need, it's what I need.
