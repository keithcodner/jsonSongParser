[Verse 1] 
Jesus, hope of the nations; Jesus, comfort for all who mourn, You are the source Of heaven's hope on earth.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, light in the darkness, Jesus, truth in each circumstance, You are the source Of heaven's light on earth.


[Verse 3] 
In history, You lived and died, You broke the chains, You rose to life.


[Verse 4] 
You are the Hope, living in us, You are the Rock, in whom we trust. You are the Light, Shining for all the world to see. ||You rose from the dead, conquering fear, Our Prince of Peace, drawing us near. Jesus, our Hope, Living for all who will receive, Lord, we believe.
