[Verse 1] 
The wonder of Your mercy, Lord, The beauty of Your grace, That You would even pardon me And bring me to this place. I stand before Your holiness, I can only stand amazed: The sinless Saviour died to make A covenant of grace. 


[Verse 2] 
I only want to serve You, Bring honour to Your name, And though I've often failed You, Your faithfulness remains. I'll glory in my weakness, That I might know Your strength. I will live my life at the cross of Christ, And raise a banner to proclaim: 


[Verse 3] 
The wonder of Your mercy, Lord, The beauty of Your grace, That You would even pardon me And bring me to this place. I stand before Your holiness, I can only stand amazed: The sinless Saviour died to make A covenant of grace. 


[Verse 4] 
You welcome us before You, Into this holy place; The brilliance of Your glory Demands our endless praise. The One, the only Saviour Has opened heaven's doors; We can enter in, free from all our sin, By Your cleansing sacrifice.


[Verse 5] 
The wonder of Your mercy, Lord, The beauty of Your grace, That You would even pardon me And bring me to this place. I stand before Your holiness, I can only stand amazed: The sinless Saviour died to make A covenant of grace.
