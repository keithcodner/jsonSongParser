[Verse 1] 
As we seek Your face, May we know Your heart, Feel Your presence, acceptance, As we seek Your face.


[Verse 2] 
Move among us now, Come reveal Your power, Show Your presence, acceptance, Move among us now.


[Verse 3] 
At Your feet we fall, Sovereign Lord, We cry 'holy, holy', At Your feet we fall.
