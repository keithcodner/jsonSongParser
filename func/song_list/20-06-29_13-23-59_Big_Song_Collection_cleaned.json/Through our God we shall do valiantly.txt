[Verse 1] 
Through our God we shall do valiantly, It is He who will tread down our enemies. We'll sing and shout His victory, Christ is King!


[Verse 2] 
For God has won the victory And set His people free; His word has slain the enemy, The earth shall stand and see that -


[Verse 3] 
Through our God we shall do valiantly, It is He who will tread down our enemies. We'll sing and shout His victory, Christ is King! Christ is King! Christ is King!
