[Verse 1] 
If I seek You, I will find You, But I need to take the time. If I call You, You will answer, But I need to take the time.


[Verse 2] 
Give me a pure heart, Give me a pure heart, I'm calling to You. Give me a pure heart, Give me a pure heart, I'm longing for You.


[Verse 3] 
If I listen, I will hear You, But I need to take the time. If I follow, You will lead me, But I need to take the time.


[Verse 4] 
Give me a pure heart, Give me a pure heart, I'm calling to You. Give me a pure heart, Give me a pure heart, I'm longing for You.
