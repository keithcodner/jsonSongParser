[Verse 1] 
Jesus, lover of my soul, Jesus, I will never let You go: You've taken me from the miry clay, You've set my feet upon the rock and now I know:


[Verse 2] 
I love You, I need You, Though my world will fall, I'll never let You go; My Saviour, my closest Friend, I will worship You until the very end.
