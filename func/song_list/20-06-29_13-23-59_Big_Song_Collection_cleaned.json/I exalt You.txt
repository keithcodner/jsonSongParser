[Verse 1] 
I exalt You, Just and true are all Your ways. I exalt You, And glorify Your name. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
For You are resplendent in Your majesty, There is no other God beside You; Magnificent in power and in glory, You are Jehovah God Almighty. Holy is the Lord of hosts, Holy is the Lord. Holy is the Lord of hosts, Holy is the Lord!
