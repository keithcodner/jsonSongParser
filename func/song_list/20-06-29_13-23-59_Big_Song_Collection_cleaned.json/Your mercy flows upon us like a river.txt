[Verse 1] 
Your mercy flows upon us like a river. Your mercy stands unshakeable and true. Most holy God, of all good things the Giver, We turn and lift our fervent prayer to You.


[Verse 2] 
Hear our cry, (echo) O Lord, (echo) Be merciful (echo) Once more; (echo) Let Your love (echo) Your anger stem, (echo) Remember mercy, O Lord, again.


[Verse 3] 
Your church once great, though standing clothed in sorrow, Is even still the bride that You adore; Revive Your church, that we again may honour Our God and King, our Master and our Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Hear our cry, (echo) O Lord, (echo) Be merciful (echo) Once more; (echo) Let Your love (echo) Your anger stem, (echo) Remember mercy, O Lord, again.


[Verse 5] 
As we have slept, this nation has been taken By every sin ever known to man; So at its gates, though burnt by fire and broken, In Jesus' name we come to take our stand. 


[Verse 6] 
Hear our cry, (echo) O Lord, (echo) Be merciful (echo) Once more; (echo) Let Your love (echo) Your anger stem, (echo) Remember mercy, O Lord, again.
