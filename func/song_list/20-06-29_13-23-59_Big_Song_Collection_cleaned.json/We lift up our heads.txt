[Verse 1] 
We lift up our heads, And we will sing our praise To Him who sits on the throne. We lift up our heads To the King of kings, Who reigns in heaven and earth.


[Verse 2] 
Holy and mighty, Awesome in power, Full of compassion And love.


[Verse 3] 
We lift up our heads, And we will sing our praise To Him who sits on the throne. We lift up our heads To the King of kings, Who reigns in heaven and earth.


[Verse 4] 
Glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, Working His wonders In us. 


[Verse 5] 
We lift up our heads, And we will sing our praise To Him who sits on the throne. We lift up our heads To the King of kings, Who reigns in heaven and earth.
