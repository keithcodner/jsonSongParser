Sing praises to our God, sing praises. Sing praises to the King, sing praises. Sing praises to our God, sing praises. Sing praises to the King, sing praises.


[Verse 2] 
For God is King of all the earth, Sing to Him a psalm of praise. God reigns over the nations, All our worship we will raise. He's King of all the earth, Bring to Him a joyful song. He's Lord of all creation, Seated on His holy throne.

Clap your hands, all you nations, Shout to God with cries of joy, How awesome is the Lord most high. Clap your hands, all creation, Cry to God who made us all, The great King over all the world.


[Verse 5] 
Sing praises to our God, sing praises. Sing praises to the King, sing praises. Sing praises to our God, sing praises. Sing praises to the King, sing praises.
