[Verse 1] 
The cross before me, the world behind; No turning back, raise the banner high: It's not for me, it's all for You. ||Let the heavens shake and split the sky, Let the people clap their hands and cry: It's not for us, it's all for You.


[Verse 2] 
Not to us, But to Your name be the glory. Not to us, But to Your name be the glory.


[Verse 3] 
Our hearts unfold before Your throne, The only place for those who know: It's not for us, it's all for You. ||Send Your holy fire on this offering, Let our worship burn for the world to see: It's not for us, it's all for You.


[Verse 4] 
Not to us, But to Your name be the glory. Not to us, But to Your name be the glory.


[Verse 5] 
The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting: It's all for You. The waves are crashing, the sun is raging: It's all for You.


[Verse 6] 
Not to us, But to Your name be the glory. Not to us, But to Your name be the glory.


[Verse 7] 
The universe spinning and singing: It's all for You. Your children dancing, dancing, dancing: It's all for You, it's all for You. My all for You, my all for You.


[Verse 8] 
Not to us, But to Your name be the glory. Not to us, But to Your name be the glory.
