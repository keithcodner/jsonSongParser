[Verse 1] 
There's a sound on the wind like a victory song, Listen now, let it rest on your soul. It's a song that I learned from a heavenly King, It's the song of a battle royal.


[Verse 2] 
There's a loud shout of victory that leaps from our hearts As we wait for our conquering King. There's a triumph resounding from dark ages past To the victory song we now sing.


[Verse 3] 
There's a sound on the wind like a victory song, Listen now, let it rest on your soul. It's a song that I learned from a heavenly King, It's the song of a battle royal.


[Verse 4] 
There'll be crowns for the conquerors and white robes to wear, There will be no more sorrow or pain. And the battles of earth shall be lost in the sight Of the glorious Lamb that was slain.


[Verse 5] 
Now the King of the ages approaches the earth, He will burst through the gates of the sky, And all men shall bow down to His beautiful name, We shall rise with a shout, we shall fly!


[Verse 6] 
There's a loud shout of victory that leaps from our hearts As we wait for our conquering King. There's a triumph resounding from dark ages past To the victory song we now sing.


[Verse 7] 
Now the King of the ages approaches the earth, He will burst through the gates of the sky, And all men shall bow down to His beautiful name We shall rise with a shout, we shall fly! 


[Verse 8] 
There's a loud shout of victory that leaps from our hearts As we wait for our conquering King. There's a triumph resounding from dark ages past To the victory song we now sing.


[Verse 9] 
Come on heaven's children, The city is in sight. There will be no sadness On the other side.


[Verse 10] 
Come on, heaven's children, The city is in sight. There will be no sadness On the other side.
