[Verse 1] 
Blessed be the God and Father Of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing In heavenly places in Christ.


[Verse 2] 
And He has chosen us Before the world was formed To be holy and blameless before Him. In His love He has predestined us To be adopted as sons Through Jesus Christ to Himself.
