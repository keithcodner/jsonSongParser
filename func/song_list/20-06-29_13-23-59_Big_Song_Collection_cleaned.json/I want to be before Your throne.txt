[Verse 1] 
I want to be before Your throne, Where Your glory shines. I want to see, I want to know The One who saved my life.


[Verse 2] 
I want to know the One who shines, The One enthroned above the skies, The One who gave His life, Was crucified, and lifted up on high.


[Verse 3] 
I want to know as I am known In this space and time. Now I am Yours, and in lover's words: Jesus, You are mine.


[Verse 4] 
I want to know the One who shines, The One enthroned above the skies, The One who gave His life, Was crucified, and lifted up on high.


[Verse 5] 
In You I live, in You I move And have my being. It's You I love, It's You I choose to believe in.


[Verse 6] 
I want to know the One who shines, The One enthroned above the skies, The One who gave His life, Was crucified, and lifted up on high.
