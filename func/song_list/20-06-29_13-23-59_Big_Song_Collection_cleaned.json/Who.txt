[Verse 1] 
[E]How you gonna reckon with a God like this? [B]When you gonna face what you can't dismiss? [E]Whatcha gonna say to the soul kiss that [B]is my God?|| [E]Fearsome like the sag in a fat man's chair. [B]Sweeter than a patch of Rogaine hair. [E]How do you define what you can't compare? This [B]is my God.


[Verse 2] 
And there's [D]no use explaining what [D/F#]can't be con[G]tained.

[B]Sweeter than a patch of Rogaine hair. [E]How do you define what you can't compare? This [B]is my God.


[Verse 4] 
[E]How you gonna reckon with a God this great? [B]Why you gonna measure what you can't equate? [E]Whatcha gonna say to the checkmate that [B]is my God?|| [E]Stronger than the burn of an aftershave. [B]Tender as a burger in your microwave. [E]Rarer than the air in an empty grave. This [B]is my God.


[Verse 5] 
And there's [D]no use explaining what [D/F#]can't be con[G]tained.

[Verse 7] 
[F]How we gonna [G]work this [C/E]out? To fabricate a [F]God like [G]this, no [C/E]doubt, We'd end up worshipping a [F]Christ of our [G]own de[C/E]sign. But Jesus doesn't [F]fit that [G]profile; [F]His ways [G]aren't mine.

[Verse 11] 
[C]I'm not following a [G]God I can lead around; [C]I can't tame this Dei[G]ty. [C]That's why Jesus is the [G]final answer To [Em]who I want [C]my God to [D]be. He's [Em]who I want [C]my God to [D]be.


[Verse 12] 
[C]I'm not following a [G]God that's imagined. [C]Can't invent this Dei[G]ty. [C]That's why Jesus is the [G]final answer To [Em]who I want [C]my God to [D]be. He's [Em]who I want [C]my God to [D]be.
