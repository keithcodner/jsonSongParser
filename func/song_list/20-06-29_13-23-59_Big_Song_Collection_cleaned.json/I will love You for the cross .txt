[Verse 1] 
I will love You for the cross, And I will love You for the cost: Man of sufferings, Bringer of my peace. ||You came into a world of shame, And paid the price we could not pay: Death that brought me life, Blood that brought me home. Death that brought me life, Blood that brought me home. 


[Verse 2] 
And I love You for the cross, I'm overwhelmed by the mystery. I love You for the cost, That Jesus, You would do this for me. ||When You were broken, You were beaten, You were punished, I go free. When You were wounded and rejected, In Your mercy, I am healed. 


[Verse 3] 
Jesus Christ, the sinner's friend; Does this kindness know no bounds? With Your precious blood You have purchased me. ||O the mystery of the cross, You were punished, You were crushed; But that punishment Has become my peace. Yes, that punishment Has become my peace.


[Verse 4] 
And I love You for the cross, I'm overwhelmed by the mystery. I love You for the cost, That Jesus, You would do this for me. ||When You were broken, You were beaten, You were punished, I go free. When You were wounded and rejected, In Your mercy, I am healed.
