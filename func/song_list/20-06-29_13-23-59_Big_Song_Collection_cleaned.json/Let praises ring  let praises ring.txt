[Verse 1] 
Let praises ring, let praises ring, Lift voices up to love Him, Lift hearts and hands to touch Him, O let praises ring. ||And fill the skies with anthems high That tell His excellencies, As priests and kings who rule with Him Through all eternity; Let praises ring, let praises ring To our glorious King.


[Verse 2] 
Let praises ring, let praises ring, Bow down in adoration, Cry out His exaltation, O let praises ring. ||And lift the Name above all names Till every nation knows The love of God has come to men, His mercies overflow.
