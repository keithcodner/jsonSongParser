[Verse 1] 
You laid aside Your majesty, Gave up everything for me, Suffered at the hands Of those You had created. You took all my guilt and shame, When You died and rose again; Now today You reign, In heaven and earth exalted.


[Verse 2] 
I really want to worship You, My Lord, You have won my heart And I am Yours for ever and ever; I will love You. You are the only one who died for me, Gave Your life to set me free, So I lift my voice to You in adoration.
