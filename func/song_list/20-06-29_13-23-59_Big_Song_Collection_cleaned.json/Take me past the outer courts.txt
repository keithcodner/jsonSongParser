[Verse 1] 
Take me past the outer courts, And through the holy place, Past the brazen altar, Lord, I want to see Your face. Pass me by the crowds of people, And the priests who sing their praise; I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness, But it's only found one place,


[Verse 2] 
So take me into the Holy of holies, Take me in by the blood of the Lamb; So take me into the Holy of holies, Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.
