[G]I, the Lord of [C]sea and [D]sky,|[G]I have heard my [C]people [D]cry. [Em]All who dwell in [C]dark and sin,|[Am]my hand will [D]save.|| [G]I who made the [C]stars of [D]night,|[G]I will make their [C]darkness [D]bright. [Em]Who will bear my [C]light to them?|[Am]Whom shall I [D]send?

[Verse 3]

[Verse 5] 
I, the Lord of wind and flame,|I will tend the poor and lame. I will set a feast for them;|my hand will save.|| Finest bread I will provide,|till their hearts be satisfied. I will give my life to them.|Whom shall I send?
