[Verse 1] 
He that is in us is greater than he That is in the world. He that is in us is greater than he That is in the world.


[Verse 2] 
Therefore I will sing and I will rejoice For His Spirit lives in me. Christ the Living One has overcome And we share in His victory.


[Verse 3] 
He that is in us is greater than he That is in the world. He that is in us is greater than he That is in the world.


[Verse 4] 
All the powers of death and hell and sin Lie crushed beneath His feet; Jesus owns the Name above all names, Crowned with honour and majesty. 


[Verse 5] 
He that is in us is greater than he That is in the world. He that is in us is greater than he That is in the world.
