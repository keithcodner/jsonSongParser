[Verse 1] 
[Em]I've heard it said that a[C] man would climb a mountain [D]Just to be with the [G]one he [B7]loves [Em]How many times has he [C]broken that promise [D]It has never been [G]done


[Verse 2] 
I've never [C]climbed the highest [G]mountain But I [C]walked the hill o[D]f Calvary


[Verse 3] 
[G]Just to be with you I would do [D]anything Theres no [C]price I would not [G]pay[D] [G]Just to be with you I would give [D]everything I would [C]give my life [Em]away[D]


[Verse 4] 
[Em]I've heard it said that a[C] man would swim the ocean [D]Just to be with the [G]one he [B7]loves [Em]Well all those dreams are an [C]empty emotion [D]It can never be [G]done


[Verse 5] 
I've never [C]swam the deepest [G]ocean But I [C]walked upon the raging [D]sea


[Verse 6] 
And I [Bm]know that you dont understand the f[Em]ullness of my love How I [C]died upon the cross for your [G]sins And I [Bm]know that you dont realize how m[Em]uch I gave you And I [C]promise Id do it all a[D]gain
