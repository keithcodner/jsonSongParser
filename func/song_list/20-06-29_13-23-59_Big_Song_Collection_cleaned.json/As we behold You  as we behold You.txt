[Verse 1] 
As we behold You, as we behold You, We are changing into Your image. As we behold You, as we behold You, We are changing from glory to glory.


[Verse 2] 
As we behold You in all of Your glory, Lord, by Your Spirit we are changing Into Your image from glory to glory, As we behold You, living God.
