[Verse 1] 
Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible Hid from our eyes, Most blessed, most glorious, The Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.


[Verse 2] 
Unresting, unhasting, And silent as light, Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice like mountains High soaring above Thy clouds which are fountains Of goodness and love.


[Verse 3] 
To all life Thou givest, To both great and small; In all life Thou livest, The true life of all; We blossom and flourish As leaves on the tree, And wither and perish; But naught changeth Thee.


[Verse 4] 
Great Father of glory, Pure Father of light, Thine angels adore Thee, All veiling their sight; All laud we would render: O help us to see 'Tis only the splendour Of light hideth Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible Hid from our eyes, Most blessed, most glorious, The Ancient of Days, Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.
