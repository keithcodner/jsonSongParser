[Verse 1] 
Lord, I'm grateful, Amazed at what You've done. My finest efforts are filthy rags; But I'm made righteous By trusting in the Son: I have God's riches at Christ's expense!


[Verse 2] 
'Cause it's grace! There's nothing I can do To make You love me more, To make You love me less than You do. ||And by faith I'm standing on this Stone Of Christ and Christ alone, Your righteousness is all that I need, 'Cause it's grace!


[Verse 3] 
Called and chosen when I was far away, You brought me into Your family. Free, forgiven, my guilt is washed away; Your loving kindness is life to me.


[Verse 4] 
'Cause it's grace! There's nothing I can do To make You love me more, To make You love me less than You do. ||And by faith I'm standing on this Stone Of Christ and Christ alone, Your righteousness is all that I need, 'Cause it's grace!


[Verse 5] 
Grace loves the sinner, Loves all I am and all I'll ever be; Makes me a winner Whatever lies the devil throws at me.


[Verse 6] 
'Cause it's grace! There's nothing I can do To make You love me more, To make You love me less than You do. ||And by faith I'm standing on this Stone Of Christ and Christ alone, Your righteousness is all that I need, 'Cause it's grace!


[Verse 7] 
Freely given, but bought with priceless blood, My life was ransomed at Calvary. There my Jesus gave everything He could That I might live for eternity.


[Verse 8] 
'Cause it's grace! There's nothing I can do To make You love me more, To make You love me less than You do. ||And by faith I'm standing on this Stone Of Christ and Christ alone, Your righteousness is all that I need, 'Cause it's grace!
