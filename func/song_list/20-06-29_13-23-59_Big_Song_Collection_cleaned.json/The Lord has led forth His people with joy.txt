[Verse 1] 
The Lord has led forth His people with joy, And His chosen ones with singing, singing. The Lord has led forth His people with joy, And His chosen ones with singing.


[Verse 2] 
He has given to them the lands of the nations, To possess the fruit and keep His laws, And praise, praise His name.
