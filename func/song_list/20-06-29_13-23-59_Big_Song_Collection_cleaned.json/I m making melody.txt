[Verse 1] 
I'm making melody in my heart to You. I'm making melody in my heart to You. Pouring out Your praise With everything within. ||I'm making melody in my heart to You. I'm making melody in my heart to You. Yours will always be The song I love to sing.


[Verse 2] 
How can hearts not love Your name? How can souls not sing Your praise? Jesus, You put music in my soul.


[Verse 3] 
I'm making melody in my heart to You. I'm making melody in my heart to You. Pouring out Your praise With everything within. ||I'm making melody in my heart to You. I'm making melody in my heart to You. Yours will always be The song I love to sing.
