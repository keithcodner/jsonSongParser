[Verse 1] 
My [D]Jesu[G]s I [D]love Thee; I [A]know Thou art [D]mine. For [D]Thee [G]all the [D]follies of [A]sin I re[D]sign. My [D]gra[G]cious [Em]Re-[D]deeme[A]r, my [D-D/F#-G]Sa--vi--or [D]art [A]Thou. If [D]ev[G]er I [D-D/G#]loved [Bm]Thee, my [Em-A]Jesus, 'tis [D]now.


[Verse 2] 
I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree. I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow. If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.


[Verse 3] 
I'll [E]love [A]Thee in [E]life; I will [B]love Thee in [E]death And [E]praise [A]Thee as [E]long as Thou l[B]endest me [E]breath And [E]say [A]when the [F#m]death-[E]dew [B]lies [E-E/G#]cold [A]on [A/F#]my [E]bro[B]w If [E]ev[A]er I [E-E/D#]loved [C#m]Thee, my [F#m-B]Jesus, 'tis [E]now.


[Verse 4] 
In mansions of glory and endless delight I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright. I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow. If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
