[Verse 1] 
The [G]nails in Your hands, The [Em]nail in Your feet, They [C]tell me how much You [D]love me;|| The [G]thorns on Your brow, [Em]They tell me how, You [C]bore so much shame to [D]love me.


[Verse 2] 
And when the [Bm]heavens pass a[Em]way, All Your [Bm]scars will still re[Em]main, And for[Bm]ever they will [Em]say how much You [D]love me...


[Verse 3] 
And I want to say, "For[G]ever my love, For[Em]ever my heart, For[C]ever my life is [D]Yours."[G] (2x)


[Verse 4] 
The [G]nails in Your hands, The [Em]nail in Your feet, They [C]tell me how much You [D]love me;|| The [G]thorns on Your brow, [Em]They tell me how, You [C]bore so much shame to [D]love me.


[Verse 5] 
And when the [Bm]heavens pass a[Em]way, All Your [Bm]scars will still re[Em]main, And for[Bm]ever they will [Em]say how much You [D]love me...


[Verse 6] 
And I want to say, "For[G]ever my love, For[Em]ever my heart, For[C]ever my life is [D]Yours."[G] (2x)
