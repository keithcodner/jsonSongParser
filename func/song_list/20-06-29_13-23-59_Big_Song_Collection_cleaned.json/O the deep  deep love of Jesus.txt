[Verse 1] 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus! Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free; Rolling as a mighty ocean In its fulness over me. Underneath me, all around me, Is the current of Thy love; Leading onward, leading homeward, To my glorious rest above.


[Verse 2] 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus! Spread His praise from shore to shore, How He loveth, ever loveth, Changeth never, nevermore; How He watches o'er His loved ones, Died to call them all His own; How for them He intercedeth, Watches over them from the throne.


[Verse 3] 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus! Love of every love the best: 'Tis an ocean vast of blessing, 'Tis a haven sweet of rest. O the deep, deep love of Jesus! 'Tis a heaven of heavens to me; And it lifts me up to glory, For it lifts me up to Thee.
