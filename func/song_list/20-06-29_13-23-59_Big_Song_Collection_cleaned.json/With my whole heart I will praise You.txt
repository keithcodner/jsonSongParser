[Verse 1] 
With my whole heart I will praise You, Holding nothing back, Hallelujah! You have made me glad and now I come with open arms to thank You, With my heart embrace, Hallelujah! ||I can see Your face is smiling. With my whole life I will serve You, Captured by Your love, Hallelujah! O amazing love, O amazing love!


[Verse 2] 
Lord, Your heart is overflowing With a love divine, Hallelujah! And this love is mine for ever. Now Your joy has set You laughing As You join the song, Hallelujah! ||Heaven sings along, I hear the Voices swell to great crescendos, Praising Your great love, Hallelujah! O amazing love, O amazing love!


[Verse 3] 
Come, O Bridegroom, clothed in splendour, My Beloved One, Hallelujah! How I long to run and meet You. You're the fairest of ten thousand, You're my life and breath, Hallelujah! ||Love as strong as death has won me. All the rivers, all the oceans Cannot quench this love, Hallelujah! O amazing love, O amazing love!
