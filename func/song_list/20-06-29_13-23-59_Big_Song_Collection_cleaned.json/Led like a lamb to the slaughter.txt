[Verse 1] 
Led like a lamb to the slaughter In silence and shame, There on Your back You carried a world Of violence and pain. Bleeding, dying, bleeding, dying.


[Verse 2] 
You're alive, You're alive, You have risen, Alleluia! And the power and the glory is given, Alleluia, Jesus, to You.


[Verse 3] 
At break of dawn, poor Mary, Still weeping she came, When through her grief She heard Your voice Now speaking her name. Mary, Master, Mary, Master!


[Verse 4] 
You're alive, You're alive, You have risen, Alleluia! And the power and the glory is given, Alleluia, Jesus, to You.


[Verse 5] 
At the right hand of the Father Now seated on high You have begun Your eternal reign Of justice and joy. Glory, glory, glory, glory. 


[Verse 6] 
You're alive, You're alive, You have risen, Alleluia! And the power and the glory is given, Alleluia, Jesus, to You.
