[Verse 1] 
Teach me of Your ways, To honour You with all I have, And that I learn to say: 'Not my will, but Yours, my Lord.'


[Verse 2] 
O Jesus, be glorified In all of my life. It's all about You, And the worship You're due. So help me to change, Mould me like clay; Lord, have Your way, Lord, have Your way with me.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, I long to be A faithful child who honours You. So Jesus, be in me, Let Your light shine through me now.


[Verse 4] 
O Jesus, be glorified In all of my life. It's all about You, And the worship You're due. So help me to change, Mould me like clay; Lord, have Your way, Lord, have Your way with me.
