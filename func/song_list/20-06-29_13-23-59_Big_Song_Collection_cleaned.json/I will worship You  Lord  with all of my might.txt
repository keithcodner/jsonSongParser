[Verse 1] 
I will worship You, Lord, with all of my might, I will praise You with a psalm. I will worship You, Lord, with all of my might, I will praise You all day long.


[Verse 2] 
For Thou, O Lord, art glorious, And Thy name is greatly to be praised; May my heart be pure and holy in Thy sight, As I worship You with all of my might.
