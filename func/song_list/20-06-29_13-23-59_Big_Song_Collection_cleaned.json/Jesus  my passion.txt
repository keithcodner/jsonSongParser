[Verse 1] 
Jesus, my passion in life is to know You. May all other goals bow down to This journey of loving You more. ||Jesus, You've showered Your goodness on me, Given Your gifts so freely, But there's one thing I'm longing for. Hear my heart's cry, And my prayer for this life.


[Verse 2] 
Above all else, above all else, Above all else, give me Yourself.
