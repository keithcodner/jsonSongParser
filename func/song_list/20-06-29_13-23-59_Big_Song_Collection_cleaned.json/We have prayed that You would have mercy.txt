[Verse 1] 
We have prayed that You would have mercy; We believe from heaven You've heard. Heal our land, so dry and so thirsty; We have strayed so far from You, Lord. ||Your cloud appeared on the horizon, Small as a man's hand. But now You're near, Filling our vision, Pour out Your Spirit again.


[Verse 2] 
I felt the touch of Your wind on my face: I feel the first drops of rain.


[Verse 3] 
Let it rain, let it rain. I will not be the same. Let it rain, rain on me. Let it pour down on me, Let it rain.


[Verse 4] 
Let it rain, let it rain, Let it rain, let it rain on me. Let it rain, let it rain, Let it rain.
