[Verse 1] 
Standing in Your presence, Lord, my heart and life are changed; Just to love You and to live to See Your beauty and Your grace.


[Verse 2] 
Heaven and earth cry out Your name, Nations rise up and see Your face; And Your kingdom is established As I live to know You more. ||Now I will never be the same; Spirit of God, my life You've changed, And I'll forever sing Your praise. I live to know You, Lord. I live to know You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
You've called me, I will follow; Your will for me I'm sure. Let Your heartbeat be my heart's cry, Let me live to serve Your call. 


[Verse 4] 
Heaven and earth cry out Your name, Nations rise up and see Your face; And Your kingdom is established As I live to know You more. ||Now I will never be the same; Spirit of God, my life You've changed, And I'll forever sing Your praise. I live to know You, Lord. I live to know You, Lord.
