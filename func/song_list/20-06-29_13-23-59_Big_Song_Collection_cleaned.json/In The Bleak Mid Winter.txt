[Verse 1] 
In the bleak midwinter Frosty wind made moan Earth stood hard as iron Water like a stone|| Snow had fallen, snow on snow Snow on snow In the bleak midwinter, long ago


[Verse 2] 
Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him Nor earth sustain Heaven and earth shall flee away When He comes to reign|| In the bleak midwinter A stable place sufficed The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ


[Verse 3] 
Angels and archangels may have gathered there Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air|| But His mother only in her maiden blis Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.


[Verse 4] 
What can I give Him Poor as I am? If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb|| If I were a Wise Man I would do my part Yet what I can give Him: give my heart
