[Verse 1] 
The birds don't worry, The flowers don't fret, The trees don't hurry For the food they get; For God looks after The things He's made: They can depend on Him.


[Verse 2] 
So don't you worry 'bout the things you need, For clothes to wear or for food to eat; But seek His kingdom and the rest will come: You can depend on Him.


[Verse 3] 
The hills don't grumble, The stars don't cry, The sun doesn't tumble From the big, blue sky; For God has set everything in place: They can depend on Him.


[Verse 4] 
You can't live longer by worrying more, You can't get taller than you were before; So seek His kingdom and the rest will come: You can depend on Him.
