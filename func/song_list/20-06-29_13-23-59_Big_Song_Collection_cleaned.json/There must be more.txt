[Verse 1] 
There must be more than this: O Breath of God, come breathe within. There must be more than this: Spirit of God, we wait for You. Fill us anew, we pray; Fill us anew, we pray.


[Verse 2] 
Consuming fire, fan into flame A passion for Your name. Spirit of God, fall in this place. Lord, have Your way, Lord, have Your way with us.


[Verse 3] 
Come like a rushing wind, Clothe us with power from on high. Now set the captives free; Leave us abandoned to Your praise. Lord, let Your glory fall; Lord, let Your glory fall.


[Verse 4] 
Consuming fire, fan into flame A passion for Your name. Spirit of God, fall in this place. Lord, have Your way, Lord, have Your way with us.
