[Verse 1] 
Your love, O Lord, It reaches to the heavens; Your faithfulness, It reaches to the skies. Your righteousness is like The mighty mountains; How priceless is Your faithful love.


[Verse 2] 
I will exalt You, O Lord, I will exalt You, O Lord. Praise Your holy name, That my heart may sing to You; I will exalt You, O Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Your name, O Lord, It is a mighty tower; Your glory It covers all the earth. In Your hands alone Are strength and power, All praise to be Your glorious name. 


[Verse 4] 
I will exalt You, O Lord, I will exalt You, O Lord. Praise Your holy name, That my heart may sing to You; I will exalt You, O Lord.
