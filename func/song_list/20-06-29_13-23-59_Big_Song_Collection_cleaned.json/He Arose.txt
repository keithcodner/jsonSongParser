[Verse 1] 
[G]Low in the grave He lay, [D]Jesus my [G]Savior! [C]Waiting the [G]coming day, [Em]Je[A7]sus my [D]Lord!


[Verse 2] 
(Spirited!) [G]Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty [C]triumph o'er His [G]foes; He a[D]rose a victor from the [G]dark [C]do[G]main, And He [C]lives for[A7]ever with His [D]saints [A7]to [D7]reign, He a[G]rose! He a[C]rose! Halle[G]lujah! [D]Christ a[G]rose!


[Verse 3] 
[G]Vainly they watch His bed, [D]Jesus my [G]Savior! [C]Vainly they [G]seal the dead, [Em]Je[A7]sus my [D]Lord!


[Verse 4] 
(Spirited!) [G]Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty [C]triumph o'er His [G]foes; He a[D]rose a victor from the [G]dark [C]do[G]main, And He [C]lives for[A7]ever with His [D]saints [A7]to [D7]reign, He a[G]rose! He a[C]rose! Halle[G]lujah! [D]Christ a[G]rose!


[Verse 5] 
[G]Death cannot keep his prey, [D]Jesus my [G]Savior! [C]He tore the [G]bars away, [Em]Je[A7]sus my [D]Lord!


[Verse 6] 
(Spirited!) [G]Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty [C]triumph o'er His [G]foes; He a[D]rose a victor from the [G]dark [C]do[G]main, And He [C]lives for[A7]ever with His [D]saints [A7]to [D7]reign, He a[G]rose! He a[C]rose! Halle[G]lujah! [D]Christ a[G]rose!
