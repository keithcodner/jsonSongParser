[Verse 1] 
If it wasn't for Your mercy, If it wasn't for Your love, If it wasn't for Your kindness, How could I stand?


[Verse 2] 
If it wasn't for Your cleansing, If it wasn't for Your blood, If it wasn't for Your goodness, How could I stand?


[Verse 3] 
And yet I find myself again Where even angels fear to tread, Where I would never dare to come, But for the cleansing of Your blood.


[Verse 4] 
With You there is forgiveness, And therefore You are feared. Jesus, it's Your loving kindness That brings me to my knees.


[Verse 5] 
And yet I find myself again Where even angels fear to tread, Where I would never dare to come, But for the cleansing of Your blood.


[Verse 6] 
In the beauty of Your holiness. In the beauty of Your holiness. In the beauty of Your holiness. In the beauty of Your holiness.
