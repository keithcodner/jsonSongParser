[Verse 1] 
Lord, You see me through Your mercy: I am guilty, still You love me. In Your kindness there is justice; Through Your goodness, You have brought me


[Verse 2] 
Here, where truth and mercy meet, You triumph over me, Your love has won my heart again. And still I am so amazed, My guilt is washed away Before Your cross of peace, Where truth and mercy meet.


[Verse 3] 
King of glory, Lord of mercy, Risen Saviour, Perfect Wonder. Through Your kindness You have drawn me, By Your suffering You have saved me.


[Verse 4] 
Here, where truth and mercy meet, You triumph over me, Your love has won my heart again. And still I am so amazed, My guilt is washed away Before Your cross of peace, Where truth and mercy meet.
