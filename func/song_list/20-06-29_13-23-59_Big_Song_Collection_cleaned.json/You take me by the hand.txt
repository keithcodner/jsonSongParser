[Verse 1] 
You take me by the hand, And though there are times I don't understand, Your love will never fail And my heart belongs to You. ||Even when the rain clouds break And the cold wind blows all around me, I will not be put to shame; Lord, my hope is in Your name. You will carry me on Your shoulders And lead me home.


[Verse 2] 
Carry me over troubled waters, Carry me over stormy seas. When the skies are dark and heavy, By Your grace You'll carry me. ||Though the way can seem uncertain Because the time of change has come, You will carry me on Your shoulders And lead me home.
