[Verse 1] 
Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord. Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
The fields are white unto harvest, But O, the labourers are so few; So Lord, I give myself To help the reaping, To gather precious souls unto You.


[Verse 3] 
Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord. Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
The time is right in the nation For works of power and authority; God's looking for a people Who are willing To be counted in His glorious victory.


[Verse 5] 
Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord. Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord.


[Verse 6] 
As salt are we ready to savour? In darkness are we ready to be light? God's seeking out a Very special people To manifest His truth and His might. 


[Verse 7] 
Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord. Here I am, wholly available; As for me, I will serve the Lord.
