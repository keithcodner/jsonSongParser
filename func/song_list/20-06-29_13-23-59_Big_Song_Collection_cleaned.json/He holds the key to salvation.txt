[Verse 1] 
He holds the key to salvation, Jesus is over all. He is the Lord of creation:


[Verse 2] 
Allelu, alleluia. Allelu, alleluia, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
He is the Rock ever standing, No man could break Him down. He is the Truth everlasting:


[Verse 4] 
Allelu, alleluia. Allelu, alleluia, Lord.


[Verse 5] 
He is a Light in the darkness, All men shall see His face. He breaks all chains to redeem us:


[Verse 6] 
Allelu, alleluia. Allelu, alleluia, Lord.


[Verse 7] 
All power to Him who is mighty, All praise to Him who is God. All glory now and for ever: 


[Verse 8] 
Allelu, alleluia. Allelu, alleluia, Lord.
