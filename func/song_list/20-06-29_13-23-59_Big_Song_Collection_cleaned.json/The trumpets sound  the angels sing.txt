[Verse 1] 
The trumpets sound, the angels sing, The feast is ready to begin; The gates of heaven are open wide, And Jesus welcomes you inside.


[Verse 2] 
Tables are laden with good things, O taste the peace and joy He brings; He'll fill you up with love divine, He'll turn your water into wine.


[Verse 3] 
Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight. Come and revel in heaven's love and light; Take your place at the table of the King. The feast is ready to begin. The feast is ready to begin.


[Verse 4] 
The hungry heart He satisfies, Offers the poor His paradise; Now hear all heaven and earth applaud The amazing goodness of the Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight. Come and revel in heaven's love and light; Take your place at the table of the King. The feast is ready to begin. The feast is ready to begin.


[Verse 6] 
Ldr: Jesus, (All echo each line) We thank You For Your love, For Your joy. Jesus, We thank You For the good things You give to us. 


[Verse 7] 
Sing with thankfulness songs of pure delight. Come and revel in heaven's love and light; Take your place at the table of the King. The feast is ready to begin. The feast is ready to begin.
