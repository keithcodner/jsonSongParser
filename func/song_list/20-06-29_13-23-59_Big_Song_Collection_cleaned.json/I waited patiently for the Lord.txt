[Verse 1] 
I waited patiently for the Lord, He turned and heard my cry. He lifted me from the pit, Out from the mud and mire. ||He put my feet on a rock, And gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, A hymn of praise to God, A hymn of praise to God.


[Verse 2] 
Many will see, many will fear, And many will put their trust in the Lord. Many will see, many will fear, And many will put their trust in the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Blessed is the man who trusts the Lord, And turns from all the proud, From all those who have turned aside, To follow what is false. ||Many are the wonders that You have done, All the things You have planned; Were I to count they still would be Too many to declare, Too many to declare. 


[Verse 4] 
Many will see, many will fear, And many will put their trust in the Lord. Many will see, many will fear, And many will put their trust in the Lord.
