[Verse 1] 
 I’ve gotta tell You what I’m feeling I’ve gotta shout and praise Your name|| I’ve gotta tell You what I’m feeling I’ve gotta shout like there’s no tommorrow


[Verse 2] 
 I was lost, until You found me You came and rescued me The day You set me free I was looking for something


[Verse 3] 
 I will follow You Every day I’m running after You


[Verse 4] 
 I want to tell You how I feel I’ve never felt this way before You make me wanna dance Like there’s no tomorrow|| After all the things You’ve done for me I’ve gotta tell You now|| You make me wanna shout Like there’s no tomorrow


[Verse 5]

[Verse 6] 
 Now I’m found Your grace has saved me I give my life to You Nothing else I’d rather do ‘Cause I’m living it for You


[Verse 7] 
 I will follow You Every day I’m running after You


[Verse 8] 
 I want to tell You how I feel I’ve never felt this way before You make me wanna dance Like there’s no tomorrow|| After all the things You’ve done for me I’ve gotta tell You now|| You make me wanna shout Like there’s no tomorrow
