[Verse 1] 
Time is too short to say it's okay, To think I can live this way For just another day. So I'll search through the night For the One my heart loves, Won't stop till I've found You, For Lord, I need to hold You close.


[Verse 2] 
Be the King of this heart again, Be the Lord of this life. In my soul there's a cry today: Be the King of this heart, Be the King of this heart.


[Verse 3] 
I've stood in the desert and thirsted for You, I've run through the city, now I won't let go: I'm throwing myself on Your mercy, O God, You say: 'It's all or nothing.' I'm saying: 'Jesus have it all.'


[Verse 4] 
Be the King of this heart again, Be the Lord of this life. In my soul there's a cry today: Be the King of this heart, Be the King of this heart.


[Verse 5] 
Be the light for my eyes, Be the strength for my feet, Be the love of my soul, Be my everything. Be my day and my night, When I wake, when I sleep, Undivided my heart will be.


[Verse 6] 
Be the King of this heart again, Be the Lord of this life. In my soul there's a cry today: Be the King of this heart, Be the King of this heart.
