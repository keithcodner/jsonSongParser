[Verse 1] 
I give you now all I have; I give to you My everything. You have the power inside of you To overcome all the hosts of darkness.


[Verse 2] 
Go, go into the world, Tell them I'm alive, Go into the streets, Tell them that I live, Ooh, that I live in you.


[Verse 3] 
Go, go into the world, Claim it for your King, Go into the streets, Dry those people's tears, Ooh, make the old things new.
