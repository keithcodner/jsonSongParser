[Verse 1] 
The place where You dwell Is where I want to be, It's where angels in splendour Worship the King. And to Jesus in glory Each voice raised in song: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
In the light of Your presence I find perfect peace, And my heart shall adore You And in You rejoice. And to Jesus victorious I lift up my song: Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.


[Verse 3] 
It's all for You, Jesus, Only You, Jesus. You are my song and my reason to sing; You have set this heart free To rise on the wings of Your praise.
