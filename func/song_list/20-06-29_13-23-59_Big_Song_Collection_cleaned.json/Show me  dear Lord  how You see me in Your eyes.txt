[Verse 1] 
Show me, dear Lord, how You see me in Your eyes, So that I can realise Your great love for me. Teach me, O Lord, that I am precious in Your sight, That as a father loves his child, so You love me.


[Verse 2] 
I am Yours because You have chosen me. I'm Your child because You've called my name, And Your steadfast love will never change; I will always be Your precious child.


[Verse 3] 
Show me, dear Lord, that I can never earn Your love, That a gift cannot be earned, only given. Teach me, O Lord, that Your love will never fade, That I can never drive away Your great mercy. 


[Verse 4] 
I am Yours because You have chosen me. I'm Your child because You've called my name, And Your steadfast love will never change; I will always be Your precious child.
