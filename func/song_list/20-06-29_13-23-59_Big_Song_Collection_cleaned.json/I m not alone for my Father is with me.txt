[Verse 1] 
I'm not alone for my Father is with me, With me wherever I go. Speaking words of faith, of courage and of love, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.


[Verse 2] 
Waking in the morning, Getting ready for school, Walking down the road; In class, at work, or at play, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.


[Verse 3] 
I'm not alone for my Father is with me, With me wherever I go. Speaking words of faith, of courage and of love, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.


[Verse 4] 
And when I find myself in a mess, I can trust in Him; Call on His name and watch Him move, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.


[Verse 5] 
I'm not alone for my Father is with me, With me wherever I go. Speaking words of faith, of courage and of love, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.


[Verse 6] 
All of my life, everywhere that I go, I will walk with Him; Praising Him and blessing His name, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go. 


[Verse 7] 
I'm not alone for my Father is with me, With me wherever I go. Speaking words of faith, of courage and of love, He's with me, He loves me, wherever I go.
