Humble yourselves Under God's mighty hand, So that He will lift you up. (Repeat)

Cast all anxiety On Him, Because He cares for You.

Open your hearts To the Lord your God, And know His love for you. (Repeat)

Cast all anxiety On Him, Because He cares for You.

I bow down Before You, my Lord. (Repeat)
