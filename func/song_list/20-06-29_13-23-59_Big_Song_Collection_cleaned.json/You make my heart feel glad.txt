[Verse 1] 
You make my heart feel glad. You make my heart feel glad. Jesus, You bring me joy; You make my heart feel glad.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, Your love brings healing and a peace into my heart, I want to give myself in praise to You. Though I've been through heartache You have understood my tears, O Lord, I will give thanks to You.


[Verse 3] 
You make my heart feel glad. You make my heart feel glad. Jesus, You bring me joy; You make my heart feel glad.


[Verse 4] 
When I look around me, and I see the life You made, All creation shouts aloud in praise; I realise Your greatness, how majestic is Your name, O Lord, I love You more each day. 


[Verse 5] 
You make my heart feel glad. You make my heart feel glad. Jesus, You bring me joy; You make my heart feel glad.
