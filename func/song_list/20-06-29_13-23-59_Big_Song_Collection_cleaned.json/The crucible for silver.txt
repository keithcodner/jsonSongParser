[Verse 1] 
The crucible for silver And the furnace for gold, But the Lord tests the heart of this child. Standing in all purity, God, our passion is for holiness, Lead us to the secret place of praise.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Holy One, You are my heart's desire. King of kings, my everything, You've set this heart on fire. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Father, take our offering, with our song we humbly praise You. You have brought Your holy fire to our lips. Standing in Your beauty, Lord, Your gift to us is holiness; Lead us to the place where we can sing: 


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, Holy One, You are my heart's desire. King of kings, my everything, You've set this heart on fire. (Repeat)
