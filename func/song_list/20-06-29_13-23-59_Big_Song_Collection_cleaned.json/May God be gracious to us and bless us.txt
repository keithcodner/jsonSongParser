[Verse 1] 
May God be gracious to us and bless us, Make His face to shine upon us. May Your ways be known over the earth And Your salvation among all nations.


[Verse 2] 
May the peoples praise You; O God, may all the peoples praise You. May the peoples praise You; O God, may all the peoples praise You.


[Verse 3] 
May the nations be glad and sing for joy, For with justice You rule the people You guide. May Your ways be known over all the earth, And Your salvation among all nations.


[Verse 4] 
May the peoples praise You; O God, may all the peoples praise You. May the peoples praise You; O God, may all the peoples praise You.


[Verse 5] 
Then the harvest will come to the land, And God, our God, will bless us. God will bless us, and all the ends Of earth will fear Him. 


[Verse 6] 
May the peoples praise You; O God, may all the peoples praise You. May the peoples praise You; O God, may all the peoples praise You.
