[Verse 1] 
Soon, and very soon, We are going to see the King; Soon, and very soon, We are going to see the King; Soon, and very soon, We are going to see the King; Alleluia, alleluia, We're going to see the King!


[Verse 2] 
No more crying there, We are going to see the King; No more crying there, We are going to see the King; No more crying there, We are going to see the King; Alleluia, alleluia, We're going to see the King!


[Verse 3] 
No more dying there, We are going to see the King; No more dying there, We are going to see the King; No more dying there, We are going to see the King; Alleluia, alleluia, We're going to see the King!


[Verse 4] 
Alleluia, alleluia, Alleluia, alleluia,
