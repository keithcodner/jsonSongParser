You are the King of kings, The Lord of Lords; All men will bow to You, Before Your throne. 


[Verse 5] 
We exalt Your name, High and mighty One of Israel, We exalt Your name. Lead us on to war, In the power of Your name. We exalt Your name, The Name above all names, Our victorious King, We exalt Your name.
