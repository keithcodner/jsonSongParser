[Verse 1] 
Lord how majestic You are, My eyes meet Your gaze And my burden is lifted. Your word is a lamp to my feet, Your hand swift to bless And Your banner a shield.


[Verse 2] 
You are my everything, You who made earth and sky and sea, All that You've placed inside of me Calls out Your name. ||To You I bow, The King who commands my every breath, The Man who has conquered sin and death, My Lord and my King, My everything!


[Verse 3] 
Lord, how resplendent You are, When I think of Your heavens, The work of Your fingers - What is man, that You are mindful of him? Yet You've crowned him with glory And caused him to reign! 


[Verse 4] 
You are my everything, You who made earth and sky and sea, All that You've placed inside of me Calls out Your name. ||To You I bow, The King who commands my every breath, The Man who has conquered sin and death, My Lord and my King, My everything!
