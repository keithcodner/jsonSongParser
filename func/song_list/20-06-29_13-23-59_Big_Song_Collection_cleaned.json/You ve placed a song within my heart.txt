[Verse 1] 
You've placed a song within my heart, And this song will bless You, Your praise is always on my lips. Whatever life may bring, I know that You are God; So I can trust in You and sing.


[Verse 2] 
Immanuel, God with us, Immanuel, You are near. Immanuel, my God is for me, My God is for me. So...


[Verse 3] 
I will bless the Lord at all times, I will bless the Lord at all times. In every situation I will give You praise, I will rejoice in You always. (Repeat)
