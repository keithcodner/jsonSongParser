[Verse 1] 
Worthy is the lamb who was slain. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, Who was slain. Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, Who was slain.


[Verse 2] 
To receive power and wealth, To receive wisdom and strength. To receive honour and glory. To receive glory and praise.


[Verse 3] 
Now to Him who sits on the throne And to the Lamb who was slain, Now be praise and honour and glory, And power forever, And power forever.


[Verse 4] 
Worthy of power and wealth, Worthy of wisdom and strength. Worthy of honour and glory, Worthy of glory and praise.


[Verse 5] 
Unto the Lamb be power and wealth, Unto the Lamb be wisdom and strength. Unto the Lamb be honour and glory, Unto the Lamb be glory and praise.
