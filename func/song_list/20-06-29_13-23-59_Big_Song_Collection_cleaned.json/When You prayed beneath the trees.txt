[Verse 1] 
When You prayed beneath the trees, It was for me, O Lord; When You cried upon Your knees, How could it be, O Lord? When in blood and sweat and tears You dismissed Your final fears, When You faced the soldiers' spears, You stood for me, O Lord.


[Verse 2] 
When their triumph looked complete, It was for me, O Lord; When it seemed like Your defeat, They could not see, O Lord! When You faced the mob alone You were silent as a stone, And a tree became Your throne; You came for me, O Lord.


[Verse 3] 
When You stumbled up the road, You walked for me, O Lord, When You took Your deadly load, That heavy tree, O Lord; When they lifted You on high, And they nailed You up to die, And when darkness filled the sky, It was for me, O Lord.


[Verse 4] 
When You spoke with kingly power, It was for me, O Lord, In that dread and destined hour, You made me free, O Lord; Earth and heaven heard You shout, Death and hell were put to rout, For the grave could not hold out; You are for me, O Lord.
