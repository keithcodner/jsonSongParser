[Verse 1] 
 Beauty for ashes Joy for my pain You've given me Wings to fly again


[Verse 2] 
 Strength for today A dance for my sorrows Because of You Because of You


[Verse 3] 
 Beauty for ashes Joy for my pain You've given me Wings to fly again


[Verse 4] 
 It's a new day It's a new day Shadows rise at the glory of the Son|| It's a new day It's a new day The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 5]

[Verse 6] 
 Hope for my future At last made brand new Because of You Because of You


[Verse 7] 
 Strength for today A dance for my sorrows Because of You Because of You


[Verse 8] 
 It's a new day It's a new day Shadows rise at the glory of the Son|| It's a new day It's a new day The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 9]

[Verse 10] 
 It's a new day It's a new day It's a new new day Since You came my way


[Verse 11] 
 Beauty for ashes Joy for my pain You've given me Wings to fly again


[Verse 12] 
 Strength for today A dance for my sorrows Because of You Because of You


[Verse 13] 
 It's a new day It's a new day Shadows rise at the glory of the Son|| It's a new day It's a new day The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 14] 
 It's a new day It's a new day Shadows rise at the glory of the Son|| It's a new day It's a new day The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 15] 
 The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 16] 
 Shades of grey, turn to colour Dark of night, breaks to day


[Verse 17] 
 Chains of fear turn to freedom Silence breaks into praise
