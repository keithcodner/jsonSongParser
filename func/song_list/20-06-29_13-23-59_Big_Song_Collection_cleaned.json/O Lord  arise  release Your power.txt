[Verse 1] 
O Lord, arise, release Your power, Scatter Your foes this very hour. May we hold on to Your holy commands. You are the Lord of every man.


[Verse 2] 
You hold our lives, You give us breath, You freed us from the power of death. You're our salvation, our only hope, You are the Lord of every man.


[Verse 3] 
Your voice, it is like thunder Over the waters. Your voice echoes throughout the earth, We will bow to the sound, We will bow to the sound Of Your voice.
