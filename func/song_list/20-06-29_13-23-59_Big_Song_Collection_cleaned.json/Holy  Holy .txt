[Verse 1] 
Holy, Holy, holy, holy Is the Lord God Almighty. Holy, holy, holy, holy Is the song around the throne. Where the angels and the elders gather There in sweet assembly, Singing holy, singing holy Is the Lord our God.


[Verse 2] 
Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy Is the Lamb who was slain for me. Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy Is the song within my heart. I could choose to spend eternity With this my sole refrain: Singing worthy, singing worthy Is the Lord our God.


[Verse 3] 
The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light, The King, the Great I Am. My life, my all, my every breath, The Rock on which I stand.


[Verse 4] 
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, How You suffered and died for us. Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, But that tomb is empty now. And I long to gaze upon Your throne And all Your risen glory: Singing Jesus, singing Jesus Is the Lord of all.


[Verse 5] 
The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light, The King, the Great I Am. My life, my all, my every breath, The Rock on which I stand.
