[Verse 1] 
I will enter His gates With thanksgiving in my heart, I will enter His courts with praise; I will say this is the day That the Lord has made, I will rejoice for He has made me glad.


[Verse 2] 
He has made me glad, He has made me glad, I will rejoice for He has made me glad. He has made me glad, He has made me glad, I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
