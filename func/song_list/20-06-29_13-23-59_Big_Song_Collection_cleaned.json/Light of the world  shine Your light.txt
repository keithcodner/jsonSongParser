[Verse 1] 
Light of the world, shine Your light Into my heart. God of love, pierce my soul With Your mercy.


[Verse 2] 
So we might see Your glory, So we might see Your face. So we can feel Your heartbeat, And hear You call our name.


[Verse 3] 
Fire of God, burn away What is not holy. Jesus, take our hearts And make them new. 


[Verse 4] 
So we might see Your glory, So we might see Your face. So we can feel Your heartbeat, And hear You call our name.
