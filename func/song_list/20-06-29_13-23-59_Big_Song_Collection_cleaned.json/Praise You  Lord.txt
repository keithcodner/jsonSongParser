[Verse 1] 
Praise You, Lord, For the wonder of Your healing. Praise You, Lord, For Your love so freely given; Outpouring, anointing, Flowing in to heal our wounds: Praise You, Lord, For Your love for me.


[Verse 2] 
Praise You, Lord, For Your gift of liberation. Praise You, Lord, You have set the captives free; The chains that bind are broken By the sharpness of Your sword: Praise You, Lord, You gave Your life for me.


[Verse 3] 
Praise You, Lord, You have borne the depths of sorrow. Praise You, Lord, For Your anguish on the tree; The nails that tore Your body And the pain that tore Your soul: Praise You, Lord, Your tears they fell for me.


[Verse 4] 
Praise You, Lord, You have turned our thorns to roses. Glory, Lord, As they bloom upon Your brow; The path of pain is hallowed, For Your love has made it sweet: Praise You, Lord, And may I love You now.
