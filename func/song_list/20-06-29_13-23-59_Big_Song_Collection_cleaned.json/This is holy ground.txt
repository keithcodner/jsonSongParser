[Verse 1] 
This is holy ground, We're standing on holy ground, For the Lord is here And where He is holy. This is holy ground, We're standing on holy ground, For the Lord is here And where He is holy.


[Verse 2] 
These are holy hands, He's given us holy hands, He works through these hands And so these hands are holy. These are holy hands, He's given us holy hands, He works through these hands And so these hands are holy.
