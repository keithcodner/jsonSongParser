[Verse 1] 
I give You all the honour And praise that's due Your name, For You are the King of glory, The Creator of all things.


[Verse 2] 
And I worship You, I give my life to You, I fall down on my knees. Yes, I worship You, I give my life to You, I fall down on my knees.


[Verse 3] 
As Your Spirit moves upon me now You meet my deepest need, And I lift my hands up to Your throne, Your mercy I've received.


[Verse 4] 
And I worship You, I give my life to You, I fall down on my knees. Yes, I worship You, I give my life to You, I fall down on my knees.


[Verse 5] 
You have broken chains that bound me, You've set this captive free; I will lift my voice to praise Your name For all eternity. 


[Verse 6] 
And I worship You, I give my life to You, I fall down on my knees. Yes, I worship You, I give my life to You, I fall down on my knees.
