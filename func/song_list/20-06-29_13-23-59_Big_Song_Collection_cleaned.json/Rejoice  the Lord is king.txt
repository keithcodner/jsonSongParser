Jesus the Saviour reigns, The God of truth and love; When He had purged our stains, He took His seat above:

Rejoice, the Lord is king! Your Lord and King adore; Mortals, give thanks, and sing, And triumph ever more:

His kingdom cannot fail, He rules o'er earth and heaven; The keys of death and hell Are to our Jesus given:

Rejoice, the Lord is king! Your Lord and King adore; Mortals, give thanks, and sing, And triumph ever more:

He sits at God's right hand Till all His foes submit, And bow to His command, And fall beneath His feet:

Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice! Again I say: rejoice!


[Verse 12] 
We soon shall hear the archangel's voice; The trump of God shall sound: rejoice!
