[Verse 1] 
Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves, Father, Your love overwhelms me. Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves, Father, Your love overwhelms me.


[Verse 2] 
So I lift up my hands, an expression of my love, And I give You my heart in joyful obedience. Father, Your love is precious beyond all loves, Father, Your love overwhelms me.
