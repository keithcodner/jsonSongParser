[Verse 1] 
(Men - women echo) We're longing for Your presence, We're waiting on Your promise, That You will flood the nation With mercy and with justice. ||We've tasted of Your goodness, We've waded in Your river, Yet still the streets are deserts, And men cry out in hunger. Let sinners find forgiveness, The lonely find a family; Cause lips that mock and curse You To sing of Your salvation.


[Verse 2] 
(All) Open the heavens and come down. Come in Your glory and Your power. Send Your revival rain: Replenish this land again! Open the heavens and come down, Come down!


[Verse 3] 
(Men - women echo) We want a way of living That ushers in Your kingdom: Faith, purity and passion, And love without condition. ||Come shake the ground on which we stand, Till all we need is found in You; Then pour the fire into our hearts To do the work that You would do.


[Verse 4] 
Open the heavens and come down. Come in Your glory and Your power. Send Your revival rain: Replenish this heart again! Open the heavens and come down, Come down!
