[Verse 1] 
O God of burning, cleansing flame: Send the fire! Your blood-bought gift today we claim: Send the fire today! ||Look down and see this waiting host, And send the promised Holy Ghost; We need another Pentecost! Send the fire today! Send the fire today!


[Verse 2] 
God of Elijah, hear our cry: Send the fire! And make us fit to live or die: Send the fire today! ||To burn up every trace of sin, To bring the light and glory in, The revolution now begin! Send the fire today! Send the fire today!


[Verse 3] 
It's fire we want, for fire we plead: Send the fire! The fire will meet our every need: Send the fire today! ||For strength to always do what's right, For grace to conquer in the fight, For power to walk the world in white: Send the fire today! Send the fire today!


[Verse 4] 
To make our weak hearts strong and brave: Send the fire! To live, a dying world to save: Send the fire today! ||Oh, see us on Your altar lay, We give our lives to you today, So crown the offering now we pray: Send the fire today! Send the fire today! Send the fire today!
