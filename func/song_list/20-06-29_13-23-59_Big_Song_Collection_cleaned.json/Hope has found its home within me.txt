[Verse 1] 
Hope has found its home within me, Now that I've been found in You. Let all I am be all You want me to be, 'Cause all I want is more of You, All I want is more of You.


[Verse 2] 
Let Your presence fall upon us, I want to see You face to face; Let me live forever lost in Your love, 'Cause all I want is more of You, All I want is more of You.


[Verse 3] 
I'm living for this cause, I lay down my life Into Your hands. I'm living for the truth, The hope of the world, In You I'll stand. All I want is You.


[Verse 4] 
All I want is, All I want is You, Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
I'm living for this cause, I lay down my life Into Your hands. I'm living for the truth, The hope of the world, In You I'll stand. All I want is You.
