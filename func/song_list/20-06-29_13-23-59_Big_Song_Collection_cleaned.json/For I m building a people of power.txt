[Verse 1] 
For I'm building a people of power, And I'm making a people of praise That will move through This land by My Spirit, And will glorify My precious name.


[Verse 2] 
Build Your church, Lord, Make us strong, Lord, Join our hearts, Lord, through Your Son. Make us one, Lord, In Your Body, In the kingdom of Your Son.
