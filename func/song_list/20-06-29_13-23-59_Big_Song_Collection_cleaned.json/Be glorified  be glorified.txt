Be glorified, be glorified. Be glorified, be glorified. Be glorified in the heavens, Be glorified in the earth; Be glorified in the temple, Jesus, Jesus, Be Thou glorified. Jesus, Jesus, Be Thou glorified.

Worship the Lord, worship the Lord. Worship the Lord, worship the Lord. Worship the Lord in the heavens, Worship the Lord in the earth; Worship the Lord in the temple, Jesus, Jesus, Be Thou glorified. Jesus, Jesus, Be Thou glorified.
