[Verse 1] 
I give my heart to what I treasure; My devotion, everything I am. Like a diamond, You treat me like I'm precious; To be Yours is more than I deserve.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, You are my treasure; Jesus, nothing less will do. Jesus, I am Yours forever; Jesus, I want to live for You.


[Verse 3] 
We are a people holy to our Saviour; For this moment He has gathered us To bring hope and healing to the nations, Till His name is known in all the earth.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, You are my treasure; Jesus, nothing less will do. Jesus, I am Yours forever; Jesus, I want to live for You.
