[Verse 1] 
Majesty, worship His majesty, Unto Jesus be glory, Honour and praise. Majesty, kingdom authority, Flow from His throne unto His own, His anthem raise.


[Verse 2] 
So exalt, Lift up on high the name of Jesus, Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus the King. Majesty, worship His majesty, Jesus who died, now glorified, King of all kings.
