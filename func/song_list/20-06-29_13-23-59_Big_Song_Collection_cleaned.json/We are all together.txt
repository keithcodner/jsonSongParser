[Verse 1] 
We are all together To call upon Your name; There is nothing we like better Than to sing and give You praise.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, we welcome You, We welcome You, We welcome You, Come fill this place.


[Verse 3] 
Bring healing and salvation, Let Your kingdom come Right here just like in heaven, Lord, may Your will be done.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, we welcome You, We welcome You, We welcome You, Come fill this place.


[Verse 5] 
Father, come fill this place, We welcome You; Jesus, we seek Your face, 'Cause all we want to do Is give our love to You. 


[Verse 6] 
Lord, we welcome You, We welcome You, We welcome You, Come fill this place.
