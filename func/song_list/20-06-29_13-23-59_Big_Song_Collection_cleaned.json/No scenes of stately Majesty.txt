[Verse 1] 
No scenes of stately Majesty for the King of kings. No nights aglow with candle flame for the King of love. ||No flags of empire hung in shame for Calvary. No flowers perfumed the lonely way that led Him to A borrowed tomb for Easter Day. 


[Verse 2] 
No wreaths upon the ground were laid for the King of kings. Only a crown of thorns remained where He gave His love. ||A message scrawled in irony - 'King of the Jews' - Lay trampled where they turned away, and no one knew That it was the first Easter Day. 


[Verse 3] 
Yet nature's finest colours blaze for the King of kings. And stars in jewelled clusters say, 'Worship heaven's King.' ||Two thousand springtimes more have bloomed - is that enough? Oh, how can I be satisfied until He hears The whole world sing of Easter love?


[Verse 4] 
My prayers shall be a fragrance sweet for the King of kings. My love the flowers at His feet for the King of love. ||My vigil is to watch and pray until He comes; My highest tribute to obey and live to know The power of that first Easter Day.


[Verse 5] 
I long for scenes of majesty for the risen King. Or nights aglow with candle flame for the King of love. ||A nation hushed upon its knees at Calvary, Where all our sins and griefs were nailed And hope was born of everlasting Easter Day.
