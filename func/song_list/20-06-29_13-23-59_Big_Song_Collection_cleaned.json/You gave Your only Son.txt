[Verse 1] 
You gave Your only Son, Came down from heaven above, Endured the cross, so I might know This love that reached for me, A love that sets me free, Your sacrifice has saved my soul.


[Verse 2] 
Today I'm reminded of Your grace; Always living now to sing Your praise, Your praise.


[Verse 3] 
Praise You, Jesus, I praise You, I lift my hands and sing. Embrace You, I will embrace You, My Saviour and my King, my King.


[Verse 4] 
I could not earn this love, Such undeserved love; Jesus, I know You are the way. You paid the price for me, Your blood was shed for me, And in Your mercy took my place.


[Verse 5] 
Praise You, Jesus, I praise You, I lift my hands and sing. Embrace You, I will embrace You, My Saviour and my King, my King.
