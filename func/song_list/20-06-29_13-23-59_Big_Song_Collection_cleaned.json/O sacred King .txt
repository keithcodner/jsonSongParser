[Verse 1] 
O sacred King, O holy King, How can I honour You rightly, Honour that's right for Your name? O sacred Friend, O holy Friend, I don't take what You give lightly, Friendship instead of disgrace.


[Verse 2] 
For it's the mystery of the universe, You're the God of holiness, Yet You welcome souls like me. And with the blessing of Your Father's heart, You discipline the ones You love, There's kindness in Your majesty. ||Jesus, those who recognise Your power, Know just how wonderful You are, That You draw near.
