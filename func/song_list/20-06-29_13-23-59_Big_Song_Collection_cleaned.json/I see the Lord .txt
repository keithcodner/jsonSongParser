[Verse 1] 
I see the Lord, And He is high and lifted up, And His train fills the temple. I see You, Lord, And You are high and lifted up, And Your train fills the temple.


[Verse 2] 
And I cry holy, holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord most high. And I cry holy, holy is the Lord, Holy, is the Lord most high.


[Verse 3] 
I see Your holiness, And light surrounds Your throne; Who am I to come before You? But now my guilt is gone, My sins are washed away, Through Your blood I come.


[Verse 4] 
And I cry holy, holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord most high. And I cry holy, holy is the Lord, Holy, is the Lord most high.


[Verse 5] 
Who am I that I should gain the Father's love? Now my eyes have seen the King. Touch my lips that I may tell of all You've done: Fill my heart I cry, Be glorified!


[Verse 6] 
And I cry holy, holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord most high. And I cry holy, holy is the Lord, Holy, is the Lord most high.
