[Verse 1] 
To be in Your presence, To sit at Your feet, Where Your love surrounds me, And makes me complete.


[Verse 2] 
This is my desire, O Lord, This is my desire. This is my desire, O Lord, This is my desire.


[Verse 3] 
To rest in Your presence, Not rushing away; To cherish each moment, Here I would stay. 


[Verse 4] 
This is my desire, O Lord, This is my desire. This is my desire, O Lord, This is my desire.
