[Verse 1] 
We're gonna sing like the saved. We're gonna sing like the saved. We're gonna sing like the saved. We're gonna sing like the saved.

It is our duty and our joy, In every time and every place, Your gates we'll enter to give thanks, Your courts we'll run into with praise.

A joyful noise we will make A joyful noise we will make A joyful noise we will make A joyful noise we will make

We're gonna dance like the saved We're gonna dance like the saved We're gonna dance like the saved We're gonna dance like the saved
