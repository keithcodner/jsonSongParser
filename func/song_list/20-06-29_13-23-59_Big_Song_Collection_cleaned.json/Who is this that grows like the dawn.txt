[Verse 1] 
Who is this that grows like the dawn, As bright as the sun, as fair as the moon? Who is this that grows like the dawn, As awesome as an army, as an army with banners?


[Verse 2] 
It is the church in the eyes of the Lord, The bride of Christ preparing for her King.


[Verse 3] 
Washed in His blood and clothed in righteousness, Anointed with the Spirit and waiting for her Lord. Who is this that grows like the dawn, As awesome as an army, as an army with banners? 


[Verse 4] 
It is the church in the eyes of the Lord, The bride of Christ preparing for her King.
