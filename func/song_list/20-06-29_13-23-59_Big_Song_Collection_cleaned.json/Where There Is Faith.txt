[Verse 1] 
[G]I believe in faithfulness, I believe in giving [C]of myself,|For someone [G]else; [G]I believe in peace and love, I believe in hones[C]ty and trust,|but it's not e[G]nough; For [D]all that I believe may never [G]change the way it [C]is,|unless [G]I believe Jesus [D]lives.


[Verse 2] 
Where there is [G]faith, there is a [C]voice calling,|"[G]Keep walking, [C]you're not a[G]lone in this [D]world;"|| Where there is [G]faith, there is a [C]peace like a [G]child sleeping|[C]hope ever[G]lasting in [D]He Who is able to [G]bear every [C]burden to [Am]heal every [D]hurt in my [G]heart; It is a [C]wonderful, [G]powerful [D]place: where there is [G]faith.


[Verse 3] 
[G]There's a man across the sea, never heard the sound of [C]freedom ring,|Only in [G]his dreams; [G]There's a lady dressed in black, in a motorcade of [C]Cadillacs,|Daddy's not [G]coming back; And our [D]hearts begin to fall and our [G]stability grows [C]weak,|But Jesus [G]meets our needs if we [D]only believe.


[Verse 4] 
Where there is [G]faith, there is a [C]voice calling,|"[G]Keep walking, [C]you're not a[G]lone in this [D]world;"|| Where there is [G]faith, there is a [C]peace like a [G]child sleeping|[C]hope ever[G]lasting in [D]He Who is able to [G]bear every [C]burden to [Am]heal every [D]hurt in my [G]heart; It is a [C]wonderful, [G]powerful [D]place: where there is [G]faith.
