[Verse 1] 
You are the song that I sing, A precious melody. You are the theme of my heart. You are my inspiration.


[Verse 2] 
You are the light of my life, How I love Your word. It leads me closer to You.


[Verse 3] 
You are my inspiration, You cause me to sing. You are my inspiration, the reason I live. You are my inspiration, I'm glad I'm alive. You are my inspiration.


[Verse 4] 
Your greatness creation displays, Such wonders to behold. In awe I, I live my days.


[Verse 5] 
How then can I be silent, When my heart is so full? In You I have discovered The secret of true love, And I want the world to know that...


[Verse 6] 
You are my inspiration, You cause me to sing. You are my inspiration, the reason I live. You are my inspiration, I'm glad I'm alive. You are my inspiration.
