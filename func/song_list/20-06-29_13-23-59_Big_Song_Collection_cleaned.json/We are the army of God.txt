[Verse 1] 
We are the army of God, Sons of Abraham, We are a chosen generation. Under a covenant, Washed by His precious blood, Filled with the mighty Holy Ghost.


[Verse 2] 
And I hear the sound of the coming rain, As we sing the praise to the great I AM. And the sick are healed, And the dead shall rise, And Your church is the army that was prophesied.
