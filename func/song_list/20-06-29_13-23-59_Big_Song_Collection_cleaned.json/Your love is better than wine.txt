[Verse 1] 
Your love is better than wine, Your name like sweetest perfume; Oh, that You would kiss me With the kisses of Your mouth And draw me, draw me after You. ||I hear You whisper my name, And like a moth to the flame I fly into the fire of Your intimate love As You draw me, draw me after You. 


[Verse 2] 
Draw me after You, Draw me after You, Draw me after You, And let us run together. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
So amazing, so divine, I am Yours and You are mine. For such love there are no words, 'Cause loving You is heaven on earth.


[Verse 4] 
So amazing, so divine, I am Yours and You are mine. For such love there are no words, 'Cause loving You is heaven on earth.


[Verse 5] 
Draw me after You, Draw me after You, Draw me after You, And let us run together. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
So amazing, so divine, I am Yours and You are mine. For such love there are no words, 'Cause loving You is heaven on earth.


[Verse 7] 
Jesus You're the One, (x3) That I will love forever. Jesus You're the One, (x3) That I will love forevermore.
