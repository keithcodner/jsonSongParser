[Verse 2] 
Breathe O breathe Thy loving Spirit into every trembling breast Let us all in thee inherit, let us find thy promised rest Take away the love of sinning, Alpha and Omega be End of faith as it's beginning, set our hearts at liberty


[Verse 3] 
Come Almighty to deliver, let us all Thy grace receive Suddenly return and never, never more Thy temples leave Thee we would be always blessing, serve Thee as Thy hosts above Pray and praise Thee without ceasing, glory in Thy perfect love


[Verse 4] 
Finish then Thy new creation, pure and spotless let us be Let us see our whole salvation, perfectly restored in Thee Changed from glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place Till we cast our crowns before Thee, lost in wonder, love, and praise
