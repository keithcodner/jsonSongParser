[Verse 1] 
Who put the colours in the rainbow? Who put the salt into the sea? Who put the cold into the snowflake? Who made you and me? || Who put the hump upon the camel? Who put the neck on the giraffe? Who put the tail upon the monkey? Who made hyenas laugh? || Who made whales and snails and quails? Who made hogs and dogs and frogs? Who made bats and rats and cats? Who made everything?


[Verse 2] 
Who put the gold into the sunshine? Who put the sparkle in the stars? Who put the silver in the moonlight? Who made Earth and Mars? || Who put the scent into the roses? Who taught the honey bee to dance? Who put the tree inside the acorn? It surely can't be chance! || Who made seas and leaves and trees? Who made snow and winds that blow? Who made streams and rivers flow? God made all of these!
