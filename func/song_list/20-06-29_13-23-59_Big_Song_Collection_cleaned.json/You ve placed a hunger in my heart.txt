[Verse 1] 
You've placed a hunger in my heart To see Your glory, You've caused a thirst that I cannot ignore; You've stirred a passion that will Drive me to Your presence, And I won't rest until You've heard me cry for more. 


[Verse 2] 
Come as a mighty torrent, Come as a raging fire, Come as a hurricane that drives The heat of my desire. Come in the smallest whisper, Come as the quiet dew: We don't care how You come, As long as You come to us. 


[Verse 3] 
Though people mock the church And curse the One who made them, Your kingdom is advancing every day; Like living stones we're being Built into a temple, We've seen the glory And we cannot turn away.


[Verse 4] 
Come as a mighty torrent, Come as a raging fire, Come as a hurricane that drives The heat of my desire. Come in the smallest whisper, Come as the quiet dew: We don't care how You come, As long as You come to us. 


[Verse 5] 
Is this the summer that will See a mighty harvest? A sense of expectation fills the air; Though sin abounds, Your love is streaming to the nations, Let mercy triumph Over judgement everywhere.


[Verse 6] 
Though people mock the church And curse the One who made them, Your kingdom is advancing every day; Like living stones we're being Built into a temple, We've seen the glory And we cannot turn away.


[Verse 7] 
Come to the politician, Come to the refugee, Come to the victim of respectable society; Come to the mighty fallen, Come to the poor oppressed: We don't care how You come, As long as You come to them.
