[Verse 1] 
Jesus, all for Jesus; All I am and have and ever hope to be. Jesus, all for Jesus; All I am and have and ever hope to be.


[Verse 2] 
All of my ambitions, hopes and plans, I surrender these into Your hands. All of my ambitions, hopes and plans, I surrender these into Your hands.


[Verse 3] 
For it's only in Your will that I am free. For it's only in Your will that I am free. Jesus, all for Jesus; All I am and have and ever hope to be.
