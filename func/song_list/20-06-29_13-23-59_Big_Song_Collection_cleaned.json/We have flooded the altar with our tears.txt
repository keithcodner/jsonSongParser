[Verse 1] 
We have flooded the altar with our tears; We have wearied You, Lord, with our words. Great God, our promises we've broken, O Lord, forgive me.


[Verse 2] 
You are breaking the pride in our hearts; You have given us tears for the lost. You crown the humble with salvation; O Lord, humble me.


[Verse 3] 
So lead me, oh lead me into Your arms; I will be safe in the shadow of Your wing. Lead me, oh lead me into Your arms; I will be safe in Almighty.


[Verse 4] 
You have paid back our sin with Your love; Lover's arms You have offered us. Faithful One, raise up a faithful people Who find their treasure here. 


[Verse 5] 
So lead me, oh lead me into Your arms; I will be safe in the shadow of Your wing. Lead me, oh lead me into Your arms; I will be safe in Almighty.
