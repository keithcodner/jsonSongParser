[Verse 1] 
The Lord is marching out in splendour, In awesome majesty He rides, For truth, humility and justice, His mighty army fills the skies.


[Verse 2] 
O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, For ever, for ever.


[Verse 3] 
His army marches out with dancing For He has filled our hearts with joy. Be glad the kingdom is advancing, The love of God our battle cry! 


[Verse 4] 
O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, For ever, for ever.
