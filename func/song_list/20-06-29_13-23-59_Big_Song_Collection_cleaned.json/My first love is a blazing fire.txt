[Verse 1] 
My first love is a blazing fire, I feel His powerful love in me. For He has kindled a flame of passion, And I will let it grow in me. ||And in the night I will sing Your praise, my love. And in the morning I will seek Your face, my love.


[Verse 2] 
And like a child I will dance in Your presence, Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me. I still remember the first day I met You, And I don't ever want to lose that fire, My first love.


[Verse 3] 
My first love is a rushing river, A waterfall that will never cease; And in the torrent of tears and laughter, I feel a healing power released. ||And I will draw from Your well of life, my love, And in Your grace I'll be satisfied, my love.


[Verse 4] 
And like a child I will dance in Your presence, Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me. I still remember the first day I met You, And I don't ever want to lose that fire, My first love.


[Verse 5] 
Restore the years of the church's slumber, Revive the fire that has grown so dim; Renew the love of those first encounters, That we may come alive again. ||And we will rise like the dawn throughout the earth, Until the trumpet announces Your return. 


[Verse 6] 
And like a child I will dance in Your presence, Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me. I still remember the first day I met You, And I don't ever want to lose that fire, My first love.
