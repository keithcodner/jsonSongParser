[Verse 1] 
 [A]I keep [B]trying to [C#m]find a life on my [A]own a[B]part from [C#m]You; [A]I am the [B]king of ex[C#m]cuses; I've got [A]one for every [B]selfish thing I [C#m]do.


[Verse 2] 
[A]What's going [B]on in[C#m]side of me? I de[A]spise my [B]own be[C#m]havior; This only [A]serves to con[B]firm [C#m]my suspicions that I'm [A]still a man in [B]need of a [C#m]Savior.


[Verse 3] 
I wanna [A]be in the [E]Light,|as [B]You are in the [C#m]Light; I wanna [A]shine like the [E]stars in the [B]Heavens Oh [A]Lord, be my [E]Light, and [B]be my sal[C#m]vation, 'Cause [A]all i want is [B]to be in the [C#m]Light, [A]All i want is [B]to be in the [C#m]Light


[Verse 4] 
The [A]disease of [B]self runs [C#m]through my blood, it's a [A]cancer fa[B]tal to my [C#m]soul; [A]Every at[B]tempt on my be[C#m]half has failed to [A]bring this sickness [B]under con[C#m]trol.


[Verse 5] 
[A]What's going [B]on in[C#m]side of me? I de[A]spise my [B]own be[C#m]havior; This only [A]serves to con[B]firm [C#m]my suspicions that I'm [A]still a man in [B]need of a [C#m]Savior.


[Verse 6] 
I wanna [A]be in the [E]Light,|as [B]You are in the [C#m]Light; I wanna [A]shine like the [E]stars in the [B]Heavens Oh [A]Lord, be my [E]Light, and [B]be my sal[C#m]vation, 'Cause [A]all i want is [B]to be in the [C#m]Light, [A]All i want is [B]to be in the [C#m]Light
