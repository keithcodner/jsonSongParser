[Verse 1] 
Jesus, lamb of God, I stand redeemed, Washed in Your blood. And in the holy place I'll bow To worship and adore.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, conquering King, You died for me, You bore my sins. Your love has brought me to my knees To worship and adore, To worship and adore.


[Verse 3] 
How I love You, How I love You, How I love You, How I love You, How I love You.
