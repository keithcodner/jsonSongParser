[Verse 1] 
O Lord, You are my rock and my redeemer; My song, You are the Strength of my life. O Lord, You are the Shepherd of Your people; You keep us always walking in Your light.


[Verse 2] 
You brought me out of darkness, You took away my shame; You broke the chains that bound me, I praise Your name!


[Verse 3] 
O Lord, You are my rock and my redeemer; My song, You are the Strength of my life. O Lord, You are the Shepherd of Your people; You keep us always walking in Your light.


[Verse 4] 
You carry all my sorrows, You carry all my pain; You fill me with Your Spirit, I praise Your name! 


[Verse 5] 
O Lord, You are my rock and my redeemer; My song, You are the Strength of my life. O Lord, You are the Shepherd of Your people; You keep us always walking in Your light.
