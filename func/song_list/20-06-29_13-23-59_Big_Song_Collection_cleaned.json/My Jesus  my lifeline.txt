[Verse 1] 
My Jesus, my lifeline, I need You more than I've ever known. There's no one quite like You, I'm crying out for Your loving.


[Verse 2] 
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, I've never known a love like this before. Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, Accept this love I give to You, It's all I can do.


[Verse 3] 
I'm searching, I'm longing, Please meet me just as You want to. I'll stand here to offer, Offer up this song of love to You. 


[Verse 4] 
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, I've never known a love like this before. Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, Accept this love I give to You, It's all I can do.
