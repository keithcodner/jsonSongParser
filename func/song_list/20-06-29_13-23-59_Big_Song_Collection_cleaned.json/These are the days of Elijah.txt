[Verse 1] 
These are the days of Elijah, Declaring the word of the Lord: And these are the days of Your servant Moses, Righteousness being restored. ||And though these are days of great trial, Of famine and darkness and sword, Still, we are a voice in the desert crying 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'


[Verse 2] 
Behold He comes riding on the clouds, Shining like the sun at the trumpet call; Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee, Out of Zion's hill salvation comes.


[Verse 3] 
These are the days of Ezekiel, The dry bones becoming as flesh; And these are the days of Your servant David, Rebuilding the temple of praise. ||These are the days of the harvest, The fields are as white in the world, And we are the labourers in the vineyard, Declaring the word of the Lord. 


[Verse 4] 
Behold He comes riding on the clouds, Shining like the sun at the trumpet call; Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee, Out of Zion's hill salvation comes.
