[Verse 1] 
We have a vision for this nation; We share a dream for this land. We join with angels in celebration, By faith we speak revival to this land.


[Verse 2] 
Where every knee shall bow and worship You, And every tongue confess that You are Lord; Give us an open heaven, anoint our prayers this day, And move Your sovereign hand across this nation.
