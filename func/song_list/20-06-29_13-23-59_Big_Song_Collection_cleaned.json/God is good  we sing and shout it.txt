[Verse 1] 
God is good, we sing and shout it. God is good, we celebrate. God is good, no more we doubt it. God is good, we know it's true.


[Verse 2] 
And when I think of His love for me, My heart fills with praise And I feel like dancing. For in His heart there is room for me, And I run with arms open wide.
