[Verse 1] 
Lord, I long to see You glorified In everything I do; All my heartfelt dreams I put aside, To see Your Spirit move with power in my life.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Lord of all eternity, Your children rise in faith; All the earth displays Your glory, And each word You speak Brings life to all who hear.


[Verse 3] 
Lord of all, All of creation sings Your praise In heaven and earth. Lord, we stand, Hearts open wide, Be exalted.
