[Verse 1] 
Mercy, mercy, Lord, Your mercy is how we are restored; Mercy, O mercy, Lord, Help us to show Your mercy, Lord.


[Verse 2] 
You have been patient with our offences, You have forgiven all of our sins; We were deserving only Your judgement, But Your great mercy triumphed again.


[Verse 3] 
Mercy, mercy, Lord, Your mercy is how we are restored; Mercy, O mercy, Lord, Help us to show Your mercy, Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, You have taught us, 'Love one another,' As You have loved us so we must love; Always forbearing, always forgiving, Showing to others the mercy we've known.


[Verse 5] 
Mercy, mercy, Lord, Your mercy is how we are restored; Mercy, O mercy, Lord, Help us to show Your mercy, Lord.
