[Verse 1] 
I long for You, O Lord. I long to know You more; I long to have Your heart placed in me every day. I long for, I long for You, O Lord.


[Verse 2] 
I hunger to eat the bread Only You can give. I'm thirsting to drink Your water That I might live, To grow in You, To know in You My every desire is found.
