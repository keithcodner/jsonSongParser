[Verse 1] 
Let us praise His name with dancing And with the tambourine. Let us praise His name with dancing, Make a joyful noise and sing.


[Verse 2] 
Dance, dance, dance before the King. Dance, dance, celebrate and sing.


[Verse 3] 
Let us celebrate with dancing; The King has set us free. Let us celebrate with dancing, Rejoice in victory. 


[Verse 4] 
Dance, dance, dance before the King. Dance, dance, celebrate and sing.
