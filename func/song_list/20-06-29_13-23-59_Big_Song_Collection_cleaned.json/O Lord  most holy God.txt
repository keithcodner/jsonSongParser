[Verse 1] 
O Lord, most holy God, Great are Your purposes, Great is Your will for us, Great is Your love. And we rejoice in You, And we will sing to You, O Father, have Your way, Your will be done.


[Verse 2] 
For You are building A temple without hands, A city without walls Enclosed by fire. A place for You to dwell, Built out of living stones, Shaped by a Father's hand And joined in love.
