[Verse 1] 
Oh . . . Let Your love come down. Oh . . . Let Your love come down.


[Verse 2] 
There is violence in the air. Fear touches all our lives. How much pain can people bear? Are we reaping what we've sown, Voices silent for too long? We are calling, Let Your love come down.


[Verse 3] 
Oh . . . Let Your love come down. Oh . . . Let Your love come down.


[Verse 4] 
There is power in Your love, Bringing laughter out of tears. It can heal the wounded soul. In the streets where anger reigns Love will wash away the pain. We are calling, Heaven's love come down. 


[Verse 5] 
Oh . . . Let Your love come down. Oh . . . Let Your love come down.
