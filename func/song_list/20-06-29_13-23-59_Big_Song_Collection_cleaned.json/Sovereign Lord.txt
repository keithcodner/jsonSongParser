[Verse 1] 
Sovereign Lord, over all, You are reigning forever. Worship flows from our lips, We have come for just one glimpse.


[Verse 2] 
And we sing hallelujah, Hallelujah, hallelujah. 


[Verse 3] 
Majesty, reign in me, Your right hand enfolding me. Earth applaud, heavens sing At the sight of Christ the King.


[Verse 4] 
Lord of lords, now enthroned, Who can stand in Your presence? Fire of love, holy One, You burn brighter than the sun.


[Verse 5] 
Majesty, reign in me, Your right hand enfolding me. Earth applaud, heavens sing At the sight of Christ the King.
