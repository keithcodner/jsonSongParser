[Verse 1] 
When I come face to face With the One the angels praise, I'm in awe, I'm amazed With a God full of grace. ||It's the love You have shown That allows me at Your throne To adore, and how I do: Father, I'm in love with You.


[Verse 2] 
Here I am with lifted hands, I give You praise And I exalt Your holy name With all I have, With all the strength that I can raise. ||And here I am once again, I lift my voice With all the angels 'round Your throne. I adore and I worship You alone.


[Verse 3] 
I am in love, I am in love with all my heart, With all my soul, and all my mind With all the strength I've ever known. ||I am in love, I am in love with the King And with His Son, the One who loved With His life and with His blood.
