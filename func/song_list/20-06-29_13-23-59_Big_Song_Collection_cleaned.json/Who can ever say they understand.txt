[Verse 1] 
Who can ever say they understand All the wonders of His master plan? Christ came down and gave Himself toman Forever more.


[Verse 2] 
He was Lord before all time began, Yet made Himself the sacrificial lamb, Perfect love now reconciled to man Forever more.


[Verse 3] 
Forever more we'll sing the story Of love come down. Forever more the King of glory We will crown.


[Verse 4] 
He is coming back to earth again, Every knee shall bow before His name, 'Christ is Lord', let thankful hearts proclaim Forever more. 


[Verse 5] 
Forever more we'll sing the story Of love come down. Forever more the King of glory We will crown.
