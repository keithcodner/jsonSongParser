[Verse 1] 
We are in God's army, We are in the army of the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah. We are in God's army, Glorie, Glorie, Glorie, The Glorie Company.


[Verse 2] 
The enemy's attacking, convinced he's gaining ground, But the only voice that he can hear is the one he shouts around; But we're not fooled by his lies, we know that he is wrong; We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.


[Verse 3] 
We are in God's army, We are in the army of the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah. We are in God's army, Glorie, Glorie, Glorie, The Glorie Company.


[Verse 4] 
The enemy's regrouping, as he tries another plan, He can't pick off an army but he can pick out a man; So we'll stay close together, and sing this battle-song; We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong.


[Verse 5] 
We are in God's army, We are in the army of the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah. We are in God's army, Glorie, Glorie, Glorie, The Glorie Company.


[Verse 6] 
The enemy's realising that his future's looking poor, Though he loves single combat, he's already lost the war; United, not divided, together we belonG; We may be weak as soldiers, but as an army we are strong. 


[Verse 7] 
We are in God's army, We are in the army of the Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah. We are in God's army, Glorie, Glorie, Glorie, The Glorie Company.
