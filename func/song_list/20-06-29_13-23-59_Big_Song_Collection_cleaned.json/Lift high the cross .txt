[Verse 1] 
Lift high the cross. Lift high the cross. In majesty, In victory.


[Verse 2] 
Here raged the fight, (Women echo) Darkness and light. (Women echo) All heaven and hell (Women echo) Battled here. (All)


[Verse 3] 
Lift high the cross. Lift high the cross. In majesty, In victory.


[Verse 4] 
Here once for all (Women echo) Was sacrificed (Women echo) The Lamb of God, (Women echo) Jesus Christ. (All)


[Verse 5] 
Lift high the cross. Lift high the cross. In majesty, In victory.


[Verse 6] 
Raise now your voices give glory and praise Him, (Leader - AII echo) For He has poured out His blood as a ransom. (Leader - AII echo) Hell's power is broken and heaven stands open, (Leader - AII echo) Lift high the cross. (All) 


[Verse 7] 
Lift high the cross. Lift high the cross. In majesty, In victory.
