[Verse 1] 
I lift You high, and bow down low, How high can You be? How low can I go? I lift You high, and bow down low, How high can You be? How low can I go? O Lord?


[Verse 2] 
You must increase, I must decrease, Lord. I'll bow down, And You will be adored. 


[Verse 3] 
I lift You high, and bow down low, How high can You be? How low can I go? I lift You high, and bow down low, How high can You be? How low can I go?
