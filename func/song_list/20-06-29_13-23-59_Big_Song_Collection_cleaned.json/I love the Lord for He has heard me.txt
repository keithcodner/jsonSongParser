[Verse 1] 
I love the Lord for He has heard me, He has heard my mercy plea. From deep within my troubled heart, I cried 'O Lord, save me!' I love the Lord for His compassion And His gracious, righteous ways. He protects the simple-hearted ones, And in my need, The Lord saw me, and saved.


[Verse 2] 
For as long, for as long as I live, I will call, I will call on His name. Be at rest once more, my soul, For the Lord is good, And He has been good to you.


[Verse 3] 
I love the Lord for all the goodness That I never can repay, But I lift the cup of salvation, And call upon His name. I will fulfil my vows before the Lord, In the presence of His saints; O, make me now Your servant, Lord, You have freed me from, You have freed me from these chains. 


[Verse 4] 
For as long, for as long as I live, I will call, I will call on His name. Be at rest once more, my soul, For the Lord is good, And He has been good to you.
