[Verse 1] 
Lord Jesus, here I stand before You, To worship You, glorify Your name, I humbly bow the knee before Your majesty, Give You the glory, give You the praise.


[Verse 2] 
I love You, lay my life before You, I trust You for my every need; I lift my hands to You, surrender everything, You are my Saviour, My Lord and King.
