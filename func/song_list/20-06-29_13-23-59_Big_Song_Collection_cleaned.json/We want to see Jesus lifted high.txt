[Verse 1] 
We want to see Jesus lifted high, A banner that flies across this land, That all men might see the truth and know He is the way to heaven. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
We want to see Jesus lifted high, A banner that flies across this land, That all men might see the truth and know He is the way to heaven. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Step by step we're moving forward, Little by little taking ground, Every prayer a powerful weapon, Strongholds come tumbling down, And down, and down, and down.


[Verse 4] 
We want to see Jesus lifted high, A banner that flies across this land, That all men might see the truth and know He is the way to heaven. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
Step by step we're moving forward, Little by little taking ground, Every prayer a powerful weapon, Strongholds come tumbling down, And down, and down, and down.


[Verse 6] 
We want to see, We want to see, We want to see Jesus lifted high. We want to see, we want to see, We want to see Jesus lifted high.


[Verse 7] 
We're gonna see, we're gonna see, We're gonna see Jesus lifted high. We're gonna see, we're gonna see, We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.
