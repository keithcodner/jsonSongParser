[Verse 1] 
He came to earth, not to be served, But gave His life to be a ransom for many; The Son of God, the Son of man, He shared our pain and bore our sins in His body.


[Verse 2] 
King of kings and Lord of Lords, I lift my voice in praise; Such amazing love, but I do believe This King has died for me.


[Verse 3] 
And so I stand, a broken soul, To see the pain that I have brought to Jesus; And yet each heart will be consoled, To be made new, the joy of all believers.


[Verse 4] 
King of kings and Lord of Lords, I lift my voice in praise; Such amazing love, but I do believe This King has died for me.


[Verse 5] 
And from now on, through all my days, I vow to live each moment here for Jesus; Not looking back, but giving praise For all my Lord has done for this believer. 


[Verse 6] 
King of kings and Lord of Lords, I lift my voice in praise; Such amazing love, but I do believe This King has died for me.
