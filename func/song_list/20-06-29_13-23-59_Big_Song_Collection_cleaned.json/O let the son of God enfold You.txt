[Verse 1] 
O let the son of God enfold You With His Spirit and His love, Let Him fill your heart And satisfy your soul. O let Him have the things that hold you, And His Spirit like a dove Will descend upon your life And make you whole.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, O Jesus, Come and fill Your lambs. Jesus, O Jesus, Come and fill Your lambs.


[Verse 3] 
O come and sing this song with gladness As your hearts are filled with joy, Lift your hands in Sweet surrender to His name. O give Him all your tears and sadness, Give Him all your years of pain, And you'll enter Into life in Jesus' name. 


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, O Jesus, Come and fill Your lambs. Jesus, O Jesus, Come and fill Your lambs.
