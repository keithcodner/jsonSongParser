[Verse 1] 
Lord of the church, You hold us in Your hand, And know us through and through. You speak to us Of love and faith and strength, And of our weakness too.


[Verse 2] 
From love grown cold, Faint faith that seems alive, From lukewarm lives and pride. We turn to You, That we may be revived, On fire with love renewed.


[Verse 3] 
Lord of the church, You hold us in Your hand, And know us through and through. You speak to us Of love and faith and strength, And of our weakness too.


[Verse 4] 
From compromise, With all that is not true, With all that is not pure, We turn to You. That we may be full of faith, Holy in all we do.


[Verse 5] 
Lord of the church, You hold us in Your hand, And know us through and through. You speak to us Of love and faith and strength, And of our weakness too.


[Verse 6] 
Lord of the Church, Your Spirit speaks in love, To call us back to You. We ask You, Lord, To share Your life with us, And fill Your church with power.


[Verse 7] 
From love grown cold, Faint faith that seems alive, From lukewarm lives and pride. We turn to You, That we may be revived, On fire with love renewed.


[Verse 8] 
Your Spirit is speaking, Your church is listening To hear, and to obey.


[Verse 9] 
Your Spirit is speaking, Your church is listening; We'll hear, and we'll obey, Lord of the Church.
