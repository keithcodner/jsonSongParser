[Verse 1] 
In the tomb so cold they laid him, Death its victim claimed. Powers of hell, they could not hold Him; Back to life He came!


[Verse 2] 
Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) Death has been conquered. (Death has been conquered.) Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) He shall reign for ever.


[Verse 3] 
Hell had spent its fury on Him, Left Him crucified. Yet, by blood, He boldly conquered, Sin and death defied.


[Verse 4] 
Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) Death has been conquered. (Death has been conquered.) Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) He shall reign for ever.


[Verse 5] 
Now the fear of death is broken, Love has won the crown. Prisoners of the darkness listen, Walls are tumbling down.


[Verse 6] 
Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) Death has been conquered. (Death has been conquered.) Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) He shall reign for ever.


[Verse 7] 
Raised from death to heaven ascending, Love's exalted King. Let His song of joy, unending, Through the nations ring! 


[Verse 8] 
Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) Death has been conquered. (Death has been conquered.) Christ is risen! (Christ is risen!) He shall reign for ever.
