[Verse 1] 
They that wait on the Lord Will renew their strength, Run and not get weary, Walk and not faint. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Do you not know? Have you not heard? My Father does not get weary. He'll give passion to a willing heart: Even the youths get tired and faint, But strength will come for those who wait.


[Verse 3] 
If you wait on the Lord You'll renew your strength, Run and not get weary, Walk and not faint. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
I will wait, I will wait, I will wait on You; I will run, I will run, I will run with You; My love, my love, my love for You.
