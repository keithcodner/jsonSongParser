[Verse 1] 
He has risen, He has risen, He has risen, Jesus is alive.


[Verse 2] 
When the life flowed from His body, Seemed like Jesus' mission failed. But His sacrifice accomplished, Victory over sin and hell.


[Verse 3] 
He has risen, He has risen, He has risen, Jesus is alive.


[Verse 4] 
In the grave God did not leave Him, For His body to decay; Raised to life, the great awakening, Satan's power He overcame.


[Verse 5] 
He has risen, He has risen, He has risen, Jesus is alive.


[Verse 6] 
If there were no resurrection, We ourselves could not be raised; But the Son of God is living, So our hope is not in vain.


[Verse 7] 
He has risen, He has risen, He has risen, Jesus is alive.


[Verse 8] 
When the Lord rides out of heaven, Mighty angels at His side, They will sound the final trumpet, From the grave we shall arise.


[Verse 9] 
He has risen, He has risen, He has risen, Jesus is alive.


[Verse 10] 
He has given life immortal, We shall see Him face to face; Through eternity we'll praise Him, Christ, the Champion of our faith. 


[Verse 11] 
He has risen, He has risen, He has risen, Jesus is alive.
