[Verse 1] 
In these days of darkness, Who will bear the light? In all of this confusion, Who will rage against the night? And who will light a beacon In the face of this dark, dark sky?


[Verse 2] 
Where there is oppression, Who will raise the flame? For the sake of all the children, Who will touch the fields of shame? And who will light a beacon In the face of this dark, dark sky, With a hope that is eternal, With a love that will never die?


[Verse 3] 
In these days of darkness, Who will bear the light? In all of this confusion, Who will rage against the night? And who will light a beacon In the face of this dark, dark sky?


[Verse 4] 
Who will burn with passion, Blazing from the heart, To forge a new tomorrow? We must tell the world Of a hope that is eternal, Of a love that will never die. And we will light a beacon In the face of this dark, dark sky.


[Verse 5] 
Where there is oppression, Who will raise the flame? For the sake of all the children, Who will touch the fields of shame? And who will light a beacon In the face of this dark, dark sky, With a hope that is eternal, With a love that will never die?


[Verse 6] 
Oh I, I will carry the fire. Oh I, I will carry the fire.


[Verse 7] 
Oh I, I will carry the fire. Oh I, I will carry the fire. I will not rest, I will not tire, With all my strength I'll carry the fire. I will not rest, I will not tire, With all my strength I'll carry the fire.
