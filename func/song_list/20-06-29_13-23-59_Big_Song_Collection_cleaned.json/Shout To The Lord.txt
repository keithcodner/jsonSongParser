[Verse 1] 
[A]My Jesus, [E]my Savior, [F#m]Lord, there is [E]none like [D]You; All of my [A]days, [D]I want to [A]praise the wonders of Your [G]migh[Bm]ty [E]love.|| [A]My comfort, [E]my shelter, [F#m]Tower of [E]refuge and [D]strength; Let every [A]breath, [D]all that I [A]am, never cease to [G]wor[Bm]ship [E]You.


[Verse 2] 
[A]Shout to the [F#m]Lord, all the [D]earth let us [E]sing, [A]Power and [F#m]majesty, [D]praise to the [E]King [F#m]Mountains bow down and the [D]seas will roar, At the [E]sound [F#m]of Your [E]name|| [A]I sing for [F#m]joy at the [D]work of Your [E]hands; For[A]ever I'll [F#m]love You, for[D]ever I'll [E]stand; [A]Nothing com[F#m]pares to the [D]promise I [E]have in [A]You.
