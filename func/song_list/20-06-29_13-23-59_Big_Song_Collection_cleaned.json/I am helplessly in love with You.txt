[Verse 1] 
I am helplessly in love with You. I am lost in something precious. I am drowning in the sea of You. I am found amongst Your treasures.


[Verse 2] 
And I don't know why You give Yourself, And I can't explain why You should care. When all heaven sings Your glory, I'm humbled that You hear my prayer.


[Verse 3] 
I can only give my heart to You, I can only give my heart. I can only give my heart to You, I can only give my heart.


[Verse 4] 
I am helplessly devoted to You; I am scorched by strange new fire. I am running deeper into You. I am high upon the wire.


[Verse 5] 
I can only give my heart to You, I can only give my heart. I can only give my heart to You, I can only give my heart.


[Verse 6] 
It's like breathing some strange new air, Walking on some distant moon. I'll sing a song from the depths of my soul: Seeking, finding, coming home. Seeking, finding, coming home.


[Verse 7] 
I can only give my heart to You, I can only give my heart. I can only give my heart to You, I can only give my heart.
