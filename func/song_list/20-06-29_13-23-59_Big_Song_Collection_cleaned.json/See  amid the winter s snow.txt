[Verse 1] 
See, amid the winter's snow, Born for us on earth below, See, the Lamb of God appears, Promised from eternal years.


[Verse 2] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem: Christ is born in Bethlehem!


[Verse 3] 
Lo, within a manger lies He who built the starry skies, He who throned in height sublime Sits amid the cherubim.


[Verse 4] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem: Christ is born in Bethlehem!


[Verse 5] 
Say, ye holy shepherds, say, What your joyful news today; Wherefore have ye left your sheep On the lonely mountain steep?


[Verse 6] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem: Christ is born in Bethlehem!


[Verse 7] 
'As we watched at dead of night, Lo, we saw a wondrous light: Angels singing, "Peace on earth" Told us of the Saviour's birth.'


[Verse 8] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem: Christ is born in Bethlehem!


[Verse 9] 
Sacred Infant, all divine, What a tender love was Thine, Thus to come from highest bliss Down to such a world as this!


[Verse 10] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem: Christ is born in Bethlehem!


[Verse 11] 
Teach, O teach us, holy Child, By Thy face so meek and mild, Teach us to resemble Thee In Thy sweet humility. 


[Verse 12] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem: Christ is born in Bethlehem!
