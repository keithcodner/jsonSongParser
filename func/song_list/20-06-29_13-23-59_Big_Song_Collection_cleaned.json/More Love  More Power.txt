[Verse 1] 
More love (more love), More power (more power), More of You in my life. More love (more love), More power (more power), More of You in my life.


[Verse 2] 
And I will worship You with all of my heart, And I will worship You with all of my mind, And I will worship You with all of my strength, For You are my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
More love (more love), More power (more power), More of You in my life. More love (more love), More power (more power), More of You in my life.


[Verse 4] 
And I will seek Your face with all of my heart, And I will seek Your face with all of my mind, And I will seek Your face with all of my strength, For You are my Lord, You are my Lord.
