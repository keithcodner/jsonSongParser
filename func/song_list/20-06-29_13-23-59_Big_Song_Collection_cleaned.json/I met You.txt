[Verse 1] 
I met You when You called my name, Love surrounded and forgave, And then You filled my heart with praise. You are the Light that seeks to save: A burning fire of purest grace, Showering the world with love.


[Verse 2] 
I will give glory unto You, I will give glory unto You, I give myself wholly, only to You.


[Verse 3] 
You stand beside me when I fail, And carry me through times of pain, For You are with me all the way. And when my life begins to fade You'll be the lamp to guide my way, Shining to eternity.


[Verse 4] 
I will give glory unto You, I will give glory unto You, I give myself wholly, only to You.
