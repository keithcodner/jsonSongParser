[Verse 1] 
O for a heart to praise my God, A heart from sin set free; A heart that always feels Thy blood So freely shed for me;


[Verse 2] 
A heart resigned, submissive, meek, My great Redeemer's throne, Where only Christ is heard to speak, Where Jesus reigns alone;


[Verse 3] 
A humble, lowly, contrite heart, Believing, true, and clean; Which neither life nor death can part From Him who dwells within;


[Verse 4] 
A heart in every thought renewed, And full of love divine; Perfect and right, and pure, and good: A copy, Lord, of Thine.


[Verse 5] 
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart; Come quickly from above; Write Thy new name upon my heart, Thy new best name of love.
