[Verse 1] 
See Him come, the King upon a donkey. Where is all His majesty and power? He who was glorious, yet for my sake Put away glory to die upon the cross. ||His body was broken, His heart was torn apart for me upon the cross.


[Verse 2] 
See the people line His path with palm leaves; Hear the children shouting out His name. He who was glorious, yet for my sake Put away power to die upon the cross. ||His body was broken, His heart was torn apart for me upon the cross.
