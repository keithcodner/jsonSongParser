[Verse 1] 
Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy, Whose trust, ever child-like, No cares could destroy; Be there at our waking, And give us, we pray, Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, At the break of the day.


[Verse 2] 
Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, Whose strong hands were skilled At the plane and the lathe; Be there at our labours, And give us, we pray, Your strength in our hearts, Lord, At the noon of the day.


[Verse 3] 
Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace, Your hands swift to welcome, Your arms to embrace; Be there at our homing, And give us, we pray, Your love in our hearts, Lord, At the eve of the day.


[Verse 4] 
Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm, Whose voice is contentment, Whose presence is balm; Be there at our sleeping, And give us, we pray, Your peace in our hearts, Lord, At the end of the day.
