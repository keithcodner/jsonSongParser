[Verse 1] 
O breath of God, breathe on us now, And move within us while we pray; The Spring of our new life art Thou, The very light of our new day.


[Verse 2] 
O strangely art Thou with us, Lord, Neither in height nor depth to seek: In nearness shall Thy voice be heard; Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.


[Verse 3] 
Christ is our Advocate on high; Thou art our Advocate within. O plead the truth, and make reply To every argument of sin.


[Verse 4] 
But ah, this faithless heart of mine, The way I know, I know my Guide; Forgive me, O my Friend divine, That I so often turn aside.


[Verse 5] 
Be with me when no other friend The mystery of my heart can share; And be Thou known, when fears transcend, By Thy best name of Comforter.
