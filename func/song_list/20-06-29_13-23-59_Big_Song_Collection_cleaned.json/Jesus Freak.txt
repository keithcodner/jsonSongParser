[Verse 1] 
[Em]Sepa[C]rated, I [A]cut myself clean|From a [Em]past that comes [C]back in my [A]darkest of dreams|| [Em]Been appre[C]hended|By a [A]spiritual force||And a [Em]grace that re[C]placed all the [A]me I divorced I saw a [Em]man with a tat on his big f[C]at belly |It wrigg[A]led around like marmalade jelly|| It [Em]took me a while|to [C]catch what it said,||'Cause I[A] had to match the rhythm|of his belly with my head|| [Em]"Jesus Saves" is [C]what it raved |In a [A]typical tattoo green|| He [Em]stood on a box in the [C]middle of the city|And [A]claimed he had a dream.

[Verse 5] 
[Em]Kami[C]kaze, my [A]death is gain|I've been [Em]marked by my [C]Maker, a pe[A]culiar display|| [Em]The high and [C]lofty |They [A]see me as weak||'Cause I [Em]won't live and [C]die, for the [A]power they seek There was a [Em]man from the desert with [C] naps in his head,|||[A]The sand that he walked was also his bed|| The [Em]words that he spoke made the [C]people assume ||There [A] wasn't too much left in the upper room.|| With [Em]skins on his back and [C]hair on his face ||They[A] thought he was crazed by the locust he ate|| Ya see the [Em]Pharisees tripped when they [C]heard him speak||Until the [A]king took the head of this Jesus Freak.
