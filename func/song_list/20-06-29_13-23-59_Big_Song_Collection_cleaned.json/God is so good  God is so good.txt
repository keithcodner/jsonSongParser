[Verse 1] 
God is so good, God is so good, God is so good, He's so good to me.


[Verse 2] 
He took my sin, He took my sin, He took my sin, He's so good to me.


[Verse 3] 
Now I am free, Now I am free, Now I am free, He's so good to me.


[Verse 4] 
God is so good, He took my sin, Now I am free, He's so good to me.
