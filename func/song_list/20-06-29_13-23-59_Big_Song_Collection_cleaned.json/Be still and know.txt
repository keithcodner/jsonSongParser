[Verse 1] 
Be still and know that I am God, Be still and know that I am God, Be still and know that I am God.


[Verse 2] 
I am the Lord that healeth thee, I am the Lord that healeth thee, I am the Lord that healeth thee.


[Verse 3] 
In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust, In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust, In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.
