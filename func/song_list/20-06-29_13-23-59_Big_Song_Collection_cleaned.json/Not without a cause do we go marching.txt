[Verse 1] 
Not without a cause do we go marching forth to war, Not without a cause that we'll see righteousness restored. Clean your weapons, stir your hearts, shed all fears before we start, When we stand to do our part we shall say:


[Verse 2] 
'Not without a right do we unsheath our silent swords, Not without a fight but we will crown Him Lord of Lords. Lift your banner, lift it high, Jesus is our battle cry. As we've lived, so we shall die, by His side.'


[Verse 3] 
Not without a foe do we prepare ourselves to fight, Not without a shout will we scale hell's unconquered height. Let the hosts of Satan pray, when we rise as one that day, Let them run in disarray, when we say:


[Verse 4] 
'Not without a right do we unsheath our silent swords, Not without a fight but we will crown Him Lord of Lords. Lift your banner, lift it high, Jesus is our battle cry. As we've lived, so we shall die, by His side.'


[Verse 5] 
Not without a cheer will we hear bells and trumpets ring, Not without a tear we'll set Him on the throne of kings. Eyes on fire and faces grim, we will free Jerusalem, Through the gates we'll follow Him, as we say: 


[Verse 6] 
'Not without a right do we unsheath our silent swords, Not without a fight but we will crown Him Lord of Lords. Lift your banner, lift it high, Jesus is our battle cry. As we've lived, so we shall die, by His side.'
