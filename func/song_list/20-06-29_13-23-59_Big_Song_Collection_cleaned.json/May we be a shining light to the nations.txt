[Verse 1] 
May we be a shining light to the nations, A shining light to the peoples of the earth; Till the whole world sees the glory of Your name, May Your pure light shine through us.


[Verse 2] 
May we bring a word of hope to thenations, A word of life to the peoples of the earth; Till the whole world knows there's salvation through Your name, May Your mercy flow through us.


[Verse 3] 
May we be a healing balm to the nations, A healing balm to the peoples of the earth; Till the whole world knows the power of Your name, May Your healing flow through us.


[Verse 4] 
May we sing a song of joy to the nations, A song of praise to the peoples of the earth; Till the whole world rings with the praises of Your name, May Your song be sung through us.


[Verse 5] 
May Your kingdom come to the nations, Your will be done in the peoples of the earth; Till the whole world knows that Jesus Christ is Lord, May Your kingdom come in us, May Your kingdom come in us, May Your kingdom come on earth.
