[Verse 1] 
Surely our God is the God of gods, And the Lord of kings, The revealer of mysteries. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
He changes the times and the seasons, He gives rhythm to the tides; He knows what is hidden In the darkest of places, Brings the shadows into His light.


[Verse 3] 
Surely our God is the God of gods, And the Lord of kings, The revealer of mysteries. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
I'll praise You always, my Father, You are Lord of heaven and earth. You hide Your secrets From the 'wise' and the learn√®d, And reveal them to this, Your child.


[Verse 5] 
Surely our God is the God of gods, And the Lord of kings, The revealer of mysteries. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
Thank You for sending Your only Son, We may know the mystery of God; He opens the treasures Of wisdom and knowledge To the humble, not to the proud.


[Verse 7] 
Surely our God is the God of gods, And the Lord of kings, The revealer of mysteries. (Repeat)
