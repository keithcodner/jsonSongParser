[Verse 1] 
Knowing Your grace Has set me free, Lord. I'm seeking Your face; I feel Your pleasure, Your joy in the ones You have chosen by name. You've lifted my burdens And cast off my shame.


[Verse 2] 
Feeling Your touch Gives me such peace, Lord. I love You so much, I know You'll lead me. Wherever I go I'll be under Your wing, For I am a child of the King.


[Verse 3] 
You will finish the work You've begun in me, I'm adopted, a son in Your family! You've drawn me with kindness and love Into this holy place.


[Verse 4] 
What can I say? Your lavish mercy Turned night into day â€“ My guilt has gone now. Forever I'll stand in Your presence and sing, For I am a child of the King.
