[Verse 1] 
I reach up high, I touch the ground, I stomp my feet and turn around. I've to (woo woo) praise the Lord. I jump and dance with all my might, I might look funny, But that's all right, I've got to (woo woo) praise the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
I'll do anything just for my God 'Cause He's done everything for me. It doesn't matter who is looking on, Jesus is the person That I want to please.


[Verse 3] 
I reach up high, I touch the ground, I stomp my feet and turn around. I've to (woo woo) praise the Lord. I jump and dance with all my might, I might look funny, But that's all right, I've got to (woo woo) praise the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
May my whole life be a song of praise, To worship God in every way. In this song the actions praise His name, I want my actions Every day to do the same.


[Verse 5] 
I reach up high, I touch the ground, I stomp my feet and turn around. I've to (woo woo) praise the Lord. I jump and dance with all my might, I might look funny, But that's all right, I've got to (woo woo) praise the Lord.
