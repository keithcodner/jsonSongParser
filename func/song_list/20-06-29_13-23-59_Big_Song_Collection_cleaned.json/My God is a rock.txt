[Verse 1] 
My God is a rock! My feet are planted And I'm not gonna stop praising. This love is alive! Goodness and mercy all the days of my life.


[Verse 2] 
My God is a Rock who can't be shaken, No, I won't ever stop praising. This love is alive With every promise written over my life.


[Verse 3] 
And in Him I live, for He lives in me. And in Him I move, and I have my being. I'm held forever in Your hand (Rock solid, rock solid). And now this ground on which I stand (Is rock solid, it's rock solid).


[Verse 4] 
My God is a Rock and my salvation, That's why I'll never stop praising. This love is alive! My strength and shelter all the days of my life.


[Verse 5] 
And in Him I live, for He lives in me. And in Him I move, and I have my being. I'm held forever in Your hand (Rock solid, rock solid). And now this ground on which I stand (Is rock solid, it's rock solid).


[Verse 6] 
My God is a Rock who never changes, How can I ever stop praising? This love is alive! Night and day He's watching over my life. 


[Verse 7] 
And in Him I live, for He lives in me. And in Him I move, and I have my being. I'm held forever in Your hand (Rock solid, rock solid). And now this ground on which I stand (Is rock solid, it's rock solid).
