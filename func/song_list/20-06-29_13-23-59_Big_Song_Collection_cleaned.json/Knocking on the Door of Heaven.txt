[Verse 1] 
[E]We will give ourselves no rest[B][A] 'Till Your kingdom comes on earth;[B][F#m7] You've positioned watchmen on the [E]walls. [E]Now our prayers will flow like tears,[B][A] For You've shared your heart with us;[B][F#m7] God of heaven, on our knees we [E]fall.


[Verse 2] 
Come [A]down in [B]power, [A/C#]reveal Your heart a[B]gain; Come [A]hear our [B]cries, the [A/C#]tears that plead for [B]rain.


[Verse 3] 
We're [E]knocking, knocking on the door of heaven, We're [C#m7]crying, crying for this generation, We're [F#m7]praying for Your name to be known[A] in all of the [B]earth.|| We're [E]watching, watching on the walls to see You, We're [C#m7]looking, looking for a time of breakthrough, We're [F#m7]praying for Your word to bear fruit [A]In all of the [B]earth, in all of the [E]earth.[(or][INTRO)]
