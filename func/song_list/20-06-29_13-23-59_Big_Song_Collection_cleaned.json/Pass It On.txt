[Verse 1] 
It [C]only takes a [Em]spark to [F]get a fire [G]going, And [C]soon all those a[Em]round, can [F]warm up in its [G]glowing; That's [F]how it is with [C]God's love, [Dm]Once [G]you've ex[Em]perienced [Am]it; You [Dm7]spread His [C]love to [Dm7]every[C]one, you [F]want to [G]pass it [C]on.


[Verse 2] 
What a [C]wondrous time is [Em]spring, when [F]all the trees are [G]budding, The [C]birds begin to [Em]sing, the [F]flowers start their [G]blooming; That's [F]how it is with [C]God's love, [Dm]Once [G]you've ex[Em]perienced [Am]it; You [Dm7]want to [C]sing, "It's [Dm7]fresh like [C]spring", you [F]want to [G]pass it [C]on.


[Verse 3] 
I [C]wish for you my [Em]friend, this [F]happiness that [G]I've found, You [C]can depend on [Em]Him, it [F]matters not where [G]you're bound; I'll [F]shout it from the [C]mountain top - PRAISE GOD! [Dm]I want the [G]world to know; The [Dm7]Lord of [C]love has [Dm7]come to [C]me, I [F]want to [G]pass it [C]on.
