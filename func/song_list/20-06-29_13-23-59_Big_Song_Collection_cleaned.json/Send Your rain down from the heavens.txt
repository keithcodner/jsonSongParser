[Verse 1] 
Send Your rain down from the heavens; Send Your rain to this earth. Let there be a great outpouring; Holy Spirit, come to us.


[Verse 2] 
Send Your fire down from the heavens; The fire of revival to Your church. We can see the world is waiting; Holy Spirit, come to us.


[Verse 3] 
Fill this land with Your grace and mercy; Cause our hearts to worship You.
