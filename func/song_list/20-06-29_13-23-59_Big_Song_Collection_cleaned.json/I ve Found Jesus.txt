Well, I [E]hear they're singing in the streets That [A]Jesus is alive, And [E]all creation shouts aloud That J[A]esus is alive; Now su[E]rely we can all be changed 'Cause [A]Jesus is alive; And every[E]body here can know That [A]Jesus is alive.


[Verse 2] 
And[C#m7] I will live for all my days [A] to raise a ban[E]ner of truth and ligh[B]t, To [C#m7]sing about my Saviour's love[A] And the b[E]est thing that happened: It was the [B]day I met You.

Well, I [E]feel like dancing in the streets 'Cause [A]Jesus is alive, To [E]join with all who celebrate That [A]Jesus is alive. The [E]joy of God is in this town 'Cause[A] Jesus is alive; For every[E]body's seen the truth That [A]Jesus is alive.
