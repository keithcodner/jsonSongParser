[Verse 1] 
When can I go and meet with God? My soul is weak, my body tired. Can it be here, can it be now? I need to find that place again.


[Verse 2] 
When can I come and meet You, God? I thirst inside for heaven's touch. Let it be here, let it be now; I need to find that place again...


[Verse 3] 
Where deep calls to deep In the roar of Your waterfalls, You're calling me With the force of Your love. ||Let Your waves sweep Over all the dry places, Lord; Usher me in to the depths of Your heart, Where deep calls to deep, Where deep calls to deep, Where deep calls to deep, Where deep calls to deep.


[Verse 4] 
I want to know Your risen power. I need to share Your sufferings; And as I die to my own will, Lord, raise me to that place again. 


[Verse 5] 
Where deep calls to deep In the roar of Your waterfalls, You're calling me With the force of Your love. ||Let Your waves sweep Over all the dry places, Lord; Usher me in to the depths of Your heart, Where deep calls to deep, Where deep calls to deep, Where deep calls to deep, Where deep calls to deep.
