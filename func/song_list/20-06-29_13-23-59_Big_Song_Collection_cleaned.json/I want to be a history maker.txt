[Verse 1] 
I want to be a history maker, (echo) I want to be a world shaker, (echo) To be a pen on history's pages, (echo) Faithful to the end of the ages. (echo) ||I want to see Your kingdom come, I want to see Your will be done On the earth. I want to see Your kingdom come, I want to see Your will be done On the earth as it is in heaven.


[Verse 2] 
I believe I was called and chosen (echo) Long before the world's creation, (echo) Called to be a holy person, (echo) Called to bear good fruit for heaven. (echo)


[Verse 3] 
I want to be a history maker, (echo) I want to be a world shaker, (echo) To be a pen on history's pages, (echo) Faithful to the end of the ages. (echo) ||I want to see Your kingdom come, I want to see Your will be done On the earth. I want to see Your kingdom come, I want to see Your will be done On the earth as it is in heaven.


[Verse 4] 
We want to be the generation (echo) Taking the news to every nation, (echo) Filled with the Spirit without measure, (echo) Working for a heavenly treasure. (echo) 


[Verse 5] 
I want to be a history maker, (echo) I want to be a world shaker, (echo) To be a pen on history's pages, (echo) Faithful to the end of the ages.
