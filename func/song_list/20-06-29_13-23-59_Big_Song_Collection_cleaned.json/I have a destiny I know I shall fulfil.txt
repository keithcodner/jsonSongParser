[Verse 1] 
I have a destiny I know I shall fulfil, I have a destiny in that city on a hill. I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish, For I know I was born for such a time as this.


[Verse 2] 
Long before the ages You predestined me To walk in all the works You have prepared for me. You've given me a part to play in history To help prepare a bride for eternity.


[Verse 3] 
I have a destiny I know I shall fulfil, I have a destiny in that city on a hill. I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish, For I know I was born for such a time as this.


[Verse 4] 
I did not choose You but You have chosen me And appointed me for bearing fruit abundantly. I know You will complete the work begun in me, By the power of Your Spirit working mightily. 


[Verse 5] 
I have a destiny I know I shall fulfil, I have a destiny in that city on a hill. I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish, For I know I was born for such a time as this.
