[Verse 1] 
You are my anchor, My light and my salvation. You are my refuge, My heart will not fear. ||Though my foes surround me on every hand, They will stumble and fall While in grace I stand. In my day of trouble You hide me and set me above To sing this song of love.


[Verse 2] 
One thing I will ask of You, this will I pray: To dwell in Your house, O Lord, every day, To gaze upon Your lovely face, And rest in the Father's embrace.


[Verse 3] 
Teach me Your way, Lord, Make straight the path before me. Do not forsake me, my hope is in You. ||As I walk through life, I am confident I will see Your goodness with every step, And my heart directs me to seek You In all that I do, So I will wait for You.


[Verse 4] 
One thing I will ask of You, this will I pray: To dwell in Your house, O Lord, every day, To gaze upon Your lovely face, And rest in the Father's embrace.
