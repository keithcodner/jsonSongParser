[Verse 1] 
I will rest in Christ Like the calm within the storm; I can find security in Him who leads me on. I will put my faith, my trust and every hope, For the peace of God will touch my soul, In Him I will be whole.


[Verse 2] 
I am not dismayed, I am not cast down; I will never be alone, I need never fear. I can always hope, I can always love; For the love of God has touched my heart, In Him I am secure.


[Verse 3] 
I will rest in Christ; I will hope in Him. I will find a place of comfort, I can find a place of rest, Held in love, loved in Him, Safe, I am secure, As I rest in Christ, As I hope in Him.


[Verse 4] 
I will trust in Christ Like a rock in stormy seas; I have found a shelter in His life and peace in me. I have found the way, The truth, this perfect life; And the hope in me is found in Him, The lover of my soul. 


[Verse 5] 
I will rest in Christ; I will hope in Him. I will find a place of comfort, I can find a place of rest, Held in love, loved in Him, Safe, I am secure, As I rest in Christ, As I hope in Him.
