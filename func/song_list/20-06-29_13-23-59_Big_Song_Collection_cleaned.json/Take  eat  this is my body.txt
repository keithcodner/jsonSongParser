[Verse 1] 
Take, eat, this is my body, Broken for you, For I am come that you might have life; Eat of My flesh and live, Eat of My flesh and live.


[Verse 2] 
My blood was shed for many, Taking away your sin, And if I shall make you free Then you shall be free indeed, You shall be free indeed.


[Verse 3] 
Take, eat, this is my body, Broken for you, For I am come that you might have life; Eat of My flesh and live, Eat of My flesh and live.


[Verse 4] 
Though your sins be as scarlet They shall be white as snow, Though they be red like crimson They shall be as wool, They shall be as wool.


[Verse 5] 
Take, eat, this is my body, Broken for you, For I am come that you might have life; Eat of My flesh and live, Eat of My flesh and live.


[Verse 6] 
For God so loved the world He gave His only Son, That whosoever believeth on Him Might have everlasting life, Might have everlasting life. 


[Verse 7] 
Take, eat, this is my body, Broken for you, For I am come that you might have life; Eat of My flesh and live, Eat of My flesh and live.
