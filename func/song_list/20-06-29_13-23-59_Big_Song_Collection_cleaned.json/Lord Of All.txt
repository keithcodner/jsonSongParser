[Verse 1] 
Shout praises to the Holy One God makes us strong, we’ll see His will be done From the highest place He came to save us


[Verse 2] 
We stand in the power of His name Salvation’s work in our lives proclaim Living for the kingdom of hope within us


[Verse 3] 
Shine your light Be that city of light

Shine your light Be that city of light
