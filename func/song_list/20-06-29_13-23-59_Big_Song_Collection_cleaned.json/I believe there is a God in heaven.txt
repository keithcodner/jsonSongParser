[Verse 1] 
I believe there is a God in heaven Who paid the price for all my sin; Shed His blood to open up the way For me to walk with Him.


[Verse 2] 
Gave His life upon a cross, Took the punishment for us, Offered up Himself in love, Jesus, Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
'It is finished' was His cry; Not even death could now deny The Son of God exalted high, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
