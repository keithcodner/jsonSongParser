[Verse 1] 
Where there once was only hurt, He gave His healing hand; Where there once was only pain, He brought comfort like a friend. I feel the sweetness of His love Piercing my darkness. I see the bright and morning sun As it ushers in His joyful gladness.


[Verse 2] 
He's turned my mourning into dancing again, He's lifted my sorrow. I can't stay silent, I must sing For His joy has come.


[Verse 3] 
His anger lasts for a moment in time; But His favour is here And will be on me for all my lifetime. 


[Verse 4] 
He's turned my mourning into dancing again, He's lifted my sorrow. I can't stay silent, I must sing For His joy has come.
