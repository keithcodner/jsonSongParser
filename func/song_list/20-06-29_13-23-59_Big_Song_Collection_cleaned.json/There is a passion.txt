[Verse 1] 
There is a passion deep in my heart To know You, Jesus. There is a hunger deep in my soul Only You can satisfy. I hear You calling, drawing me closer, I can't resist Your grace. Almighty power and love so free, Draw me to Your side.


[Verse 2] 
And I'm lifted into Your presence, Lifted into Your arms of love. Lifted into Your presence, Now has my soul found rest, Now has my soul found rest.


[Verse 3] 
I see Your face, I feel Your touch; Receive Your love, I worship You. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
And I'm lifted into Your presence, Lifted into Your arms of love. Lifted into Your presence, Now has my soul found rest, Now has my soul found rest.
