[Verse 1] 
Burn it deep within my soul, New strength and fire, O Lord. Burn it deep within my soul, New zeal and fire, O Lord. Burn it deep within my soul, New strength and fire, It makes me whole. Burn it deep, Deep within my soul.


[Verse 2] 
And You came With the Holy Spirit's desire. You came With a zeal for Your Father's house. Consume me, Lord, With Your purifying fire, And strengthen me By Your mighty hand.
