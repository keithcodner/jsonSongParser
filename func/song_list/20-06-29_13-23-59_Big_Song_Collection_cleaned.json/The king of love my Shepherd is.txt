[Verse 1] 
The king of love my Shepherd is, Whose goodness faileth never; I nothing lack if I am His And He is mine forever.


[Verse 2] 
Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul He leadeth, And where the verdant pastures grow With food celestial feedeth.


[Verse 3] 
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed, But yet in love He sought me, And on His shoulder gently laid, And home rejoicing brought me.


[Verse 4] 
In death's dark vale I fear no ill With Thee, dear Lord, beside me; Thy rod and staff my comfort still, Thy cross before to guide me.


[Verse 5] 
Thou spread'st a table in my sight; Thy unction grace bestoweth: And O what transport of delight From Thy pure chalice floweth!


[Verse 6] 
And so through all the length of days Thy goodness faileth never; Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise Within Thy house forever.
