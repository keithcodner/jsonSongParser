[Verse 1] 
God I've found in You Everything I was searching for And You've given me What I needed and so much more


[Verse 2] 
So I'm giving|Every part of me to You Won't You take my life|I'm living it for You


[Verse 3] 
Jesus I'll live for You In everything I do And when You call my name I just can't help but sing Your praises|| I'll give You all my praise I'll serve You all my days Gonna let the whole world know Jesus I am so in love with You
