[Verse 1] 
How precious, O Lord, Is Your unfailing love, We find refuge in the shadow of Your wings. We feast, Lord Jesus, on the abundance of Your house And drink from Your river of delights. ||With You is the fountain of life, In Your light we see light. With You is the fountain of life, In Your light we see light.
