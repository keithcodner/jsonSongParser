[Verse 1] 
Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. He's an exciting, powerising, c-colossal, Humungous-mungous God! 


[Verse 2] 
But it's sometimes hard to understand That the God who made the earth and man Would point a finger down from heaven and shout: ||'Hey you! I love you. Hey you! I love you. Hey you, you! I love you', but it's true!


[Verse 3] 
Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. Oi, oi, we are gonna praise the Lord. He's an exciting, powerising, c-colossal, Humungous-mungous God!
