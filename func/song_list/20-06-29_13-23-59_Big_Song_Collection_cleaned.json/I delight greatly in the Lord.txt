[Verse 1] 
I delight greatly in the Lord, My soul rejoices in my God. I delight greatly in the Lord, My soul rejoices in my God.


[Verse 2] 
For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness. He has clothed me with garments of salvation, And arrayed me in a robe of righteousness.
