[Verse 1] 
We ask You, O Lord, For the rain of Your Spirit. We ask You, O Lord, For the rain of Your Spirit. For now is the time, For now is the time Of the latter rain, Of the latter rain.


[Verse 2] 
Send Your rain, cleanse us by Your word; Let us be Your pure and radiant Bride. Make us strong, prepare us for revival; ||Let us see the nations turn their hearts, Let us see the nations turn their hearts, Let us see the nations turn their hearts To You, to You.


[Verse 3] 
Send Your rain, mercy from heaven. Send Your rain, the grace of Your Son. Send Your rain, Word of Your power, Send Your rain, come fill everyone. (Repeat)
