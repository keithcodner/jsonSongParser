[Verse 1] 
What a friend I've found, Closer than a brother; I have felt Your touch, More intimate than lovers.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Friend forever. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Friend forever.


[Verse 3] 
What a hope I've found, More faithful than a mother; It would break my heart To ever lose each other. 


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Friend forever. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Friend forever.
