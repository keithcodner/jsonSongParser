[Verse 1] 
King of history, God of eternity, You beckon me into Your arms, Where You reveal Your forgiving love That You lavish on my broken heart.


[Verse 2] 
Such amazing grace that You pour on me, And You freely give every day I live. And I'll never know the depth of love That You gave to me upon the cross.


[Verse 3] 
So I thank You for Your saving love, So I thank You for Your saving love.
