[Verse 1] 
I am not skilled to unders[D2]tand What God has willed, what God has pl[Bm7]anned. I only know at His right [Asus]hand Stands one who is my Sa[D2]vior.


[Verse 2] 
I take Him at His word and deed. Christ died to save me this I read. And in my heart I find a need Of Him to be my Savior.


[Verse 3] 
That He would leave His place on h[G2]igh And come for sinful man to [D2]die. You count it strange, so once did[Asus] I, Before I knew my Sa[D2]vior.


[Verse 4] 
My Savior [Bm7]loves. My Savior [G2]lives. My Savior's al[D2]ways there for [Asus]me. My God He [Bm7]was. My God He [G2]is. My God is al[D]ways gonna be.[Asus] (2X)


[Verse 5] 
Yes, living, dying let me bring My strength, my solace|from this spring: That He who lives to be my King Once died to be my Savior.


[Verse 6] 
That He would leave His place on h[G2]igh And come for sinful man to [D2]die. You count it strange, so once did[Asus] I, Before I knew my Sa[D2]vior.
