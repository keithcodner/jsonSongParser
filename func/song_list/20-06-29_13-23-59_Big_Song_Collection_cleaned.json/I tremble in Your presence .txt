[Verse 1] 
I tremble in Your presence, I am humbled that You came, Yet I know it's all because I choose to praise You. I recognise Your fragrance, As Your glory fills this place; All I'd planned to say means nothing now. 


[Verse 2] 
Oh, how I long for You. Oh, how I long for You. Oh, how I long for You, oh. 


[Verse 3] 
I shiver in Your presence, I am frozen by my shame. My heart is breaking more than I can stand it. Your radiance is blinding, Yet You hug me like a friend, I am overcome by Your mercy again.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, how I long for You. Oh, how I long for You. Oh, how I long for You, oh.
