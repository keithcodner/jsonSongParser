[Verse 1] 
He is Holy, Holy, Holy, My Lord is holy, holy, holy, Jesus. Give glory, glory, glory to the Son, Glory, glory, glory to Jesus!


[Verse 2] 
We're gonna give Him praise, And His name we'll raise As we celebrate with Jesus. Let our voices sing to the King of kings, Who was and is to come.


[Verse 3] 
He is Holy, Holy, Holy, My Lord is holy, holy, holy, Jesus. Give glory, glory, glory to the Son, Glory, glory, glory to Jesus!


[Verse 4] 
He's the Prince of Peace And He will release All the chains that keep you down. He's the Son of Man, He's the Great I Am, He's the mighty Lamb of heaven!


[Verse 5] 
He is Holy, Holy, Holy, My Lord is holy, holy, holy, Jesus. Give glory, glory, glory to the Son, Glory, glory, glory to Jesus!

He's the God of grace, And if we seek His face He'll demonstrate His power. On the final day unto the bride He'll say: 'At My side you'll stay forever and ever.'


[Verse 7] 
He is Holy, Holy, Holy, My Lord is holy, holy, holy, Jesus. Give glory, glory, glory to the Son, Glory, glory, glory to Jesus!
