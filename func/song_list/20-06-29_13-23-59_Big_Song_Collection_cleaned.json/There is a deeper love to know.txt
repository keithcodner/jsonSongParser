[Verse 1] 
There is a deeper love to know, There is a higher place where we can go. There is a freedom at the cross, There is a light that shines for all the world.


[Verse 2] 
And I can't hold this joy inside, I'm jumping in Your arms of mercy.


[Verse 3] 
Everybody sing, everybody shout, For the joy of the Lord Is our strength forever. Hey, everybody sing, everybody shout, For the joy of the Lord is our strength.


[Verse 4] 
There is a brighter day to come, When all the world will bow down to Your Son. And all the broken will rejoice, Even the kings will say, 'You are the Lord'.


[Verse 5] 
And we can't hold this joy inside, We're dancing in Your arms of mercy.


[Verse 6] 
Everybody sing, everybody shout, For the joy of the Lord Is our strength forever. Hey, everybody sing, everybody shout, For the joy of the Lord is our strength.
