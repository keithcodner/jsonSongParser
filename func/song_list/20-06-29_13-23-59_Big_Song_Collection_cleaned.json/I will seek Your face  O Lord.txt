[Verse 1] 
I will seek Your face, O Lord; I will seek Your face, O Lord. I will seek Your face, O Lord; I will seek Your face, O Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, how awesome is Your presence; Who can stand in Your light? Those who by Your grace and mercy Are made holy in Your sight.


[Verse 3] 
I will seek Your face, O Lord; I will seek Your face, O Lord. I will seek Your face, O Lord; I will seek Your face, O Lord.


[Verse 4] 
I will dwell in Your presence All the days of my life; There to gaze upon Your glory, And to worship only You. 


[Verse 5] 
I will seek Your face, O Lord; I will seek Your face, O Lord. I will seek Your face, O Lord; I will seek Your face, O Lord.
