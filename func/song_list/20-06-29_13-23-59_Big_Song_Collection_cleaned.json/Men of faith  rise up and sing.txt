[Verse 1] 
Men of faith, rise up and sing Of the great and glorious King; You are strong when you feel weak, In your brokenness complete.


[Verse 2] 
Shout to the north and the south, Sing to the east and the west: Jesus is Saviour to all, Lord of heaven and earth.


[Verse 3] 
Rise up women of the truth, Stand and sing to broken hearts, Who can know the healing power Of our glorious King of love.


[Verse 4] 
Shout to the north and the south, Sing to the east and the west: Jesus is Saviour to all, Lord of heaven and earth.


[Verse 5] 
We've been through fire, We've been through rain; We've been refined By the power of His name. We've fallen deeper in love with You, You've burned the truth on our lips.


[Verse 6] 
Shout to the north and the south, Sing to the east and the west: Jesus is Saviour to all, Lord of heaven and earth.


[Verse 7] 
Rise up church with broken wings; Fill this place with songs again, Of our God who reigns on high: By His grace again we'll fly. 


[Verse 8] 
Shout to the north and the south, Sing to the east and the west: Jesus is Saviour to all, Lord of heaven and earth.


[Verse 9] 
Lord of heaven and earth, Lord of heaven and earth, Lord of heaven and earth.
