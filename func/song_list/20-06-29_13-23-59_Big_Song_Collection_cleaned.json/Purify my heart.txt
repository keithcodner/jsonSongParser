[Verse 1] 
Purify my heart, Let me be as gold And precious silver. Purify my heart, Let me be as gold, Pure gold.


[Verse 2] 
Refiner's fire, My heart's one desire Is to be holy, Set apart for You, Lord. I choose to be holy, Set apart for You, my Master, Ready to do Your will.


[Verse 3] 
Purify my heart, Cleanse me from within And make me holy. Purify my heart, Cleanse me from my sin, Deep within. 


[Verse 4] 
Refiner's fire, My heart's one desire Is to be holy, Set apart for You, Lord. I choose to be holy, Set apart for You, my Master, Ready to do Your will.
