[Verse 1] 
I'm accepted, I'm forgiven, I am fathered By the true and living God. I'm accepted, no condemnation, I am loved by the true and living God.


[Verse 2] 
There's no guilt or fear As I draw near To the Saviour and Creator of the world. There is joy and peace As I release My worship to You, O Lord.
