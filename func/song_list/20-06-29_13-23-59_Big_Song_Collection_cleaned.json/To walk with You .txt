[Verse 1] 
To walk with You, to know You near me, To know Your voice, to hear You call me; This is all I ask of You. ||To be Your son, to feel You hold me, To know Your grace, to know You love me; This is all I ask of You, This is all I ask of You.


[Verse 2] 
To be Your joy, to give You glory; To live with You, forever with me. To love You, Lord, as You have loved me, Is all I ask of You, All I ask of You.


[Verse 3] 
To love Your ways, to see Your beauty, To seek Your face with all that's in me; This is all I ask of You. ||To worship You, to be Yours only, To cry Your name, my Lord Almighty; This is all I ask of You, This is all I ask of You.


[Verse 4] 
To be Your joy, to give You glory; To live with You, forever with me. To love You, Lord, as You have loved me, Is all I ask of You, All I ask of You.


[Verse 5] 
To live Your life, to serve You justly, To tell Your word, to show Your mercy; ||This is all I ask of You. To bring Your light to those who know me, To be like You, as You are holy; This is all I ask of You, This is all I ask of You.


[Verse 6] 
To be Your joy, to give You glory; To live with You, forever with me. To love You, Lord, as You have loved me, Is all I ask of You, All I ask of You.
