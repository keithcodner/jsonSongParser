[Verse 1] 
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. My meditation of Him shall be sweet, I will be glad, I will be glad in the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Bless thou the Lord, O my soul, Praise ye the Lord. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul, Praise ye the Lord. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul, Praise ye the Lord. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul, Praise ye the Lord.
