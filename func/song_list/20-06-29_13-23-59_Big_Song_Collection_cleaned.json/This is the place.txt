[Verse 1] 
This is the place Where dreams are found, Where vision comes, Called holy ground.


[Verse 2] 
Holy ground, I'm standing on holy ground, For the Lord my God Is here with me.


[Verse 3] 
Your fire burns But never dies; I realise This is holy ground.


[Verse 4] 
Holy ground, I'm standing on holy ground, For the Lord my God Is here with me.


[Verse 5] 
The Great I AM, Revealed to man; Take off your shoes, This is holy ground. 


[Verse 6] 
Holy ground, I'm standing on holy ground, For the Lord my God Is here with me.
