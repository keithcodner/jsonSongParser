[Verse 1] 
With the choir of angels singing, And the realm of heavenly hosts; As those elders humbly bow, I'd love to come to Your throne With a simple song. 


[Verse 2] 
With the living creatures speaking Praise and praise and praise again; With the company of heaven, I'd love to come to Your throne With a song of love.


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah, Jesus, Hallelujah, hallelu. Hallelujah, Jesus, Pouring out my heart to You. 


[Verse 4] 
I would bring this praise like incense Rising to Your throne above, Fill the air with heart-filled songs In harmony and melody To the One I love.


[Verse 5] 
Hallelujah, Jesus, Hallelujah, hallelu. Hallelujah, Jesus, Pouring out my heart to You. 


[Verse 6] 
And who can tell the adoration That will rise up to Your throne? Every knee that day shall bow To the King of kings, The Holy One, the only One. We'll all be singing... 


[Verse 7] 
Hallelujah, Jesus, Hallelujah, hallelu. Hallelujah, Jesus, Pouring out my heart to You.
