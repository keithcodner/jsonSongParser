[Verse 1] 
I lift my hands (ladies echo) To the coming King, (ladies echo) To the great I AM, (ladies echo) To You I sing, (ladies echo) For You're the One (ladies echo) Who reigns within my heart. (all)


[Verse 2] 
And I will serve no foreign God, Or any other treasure; You are my heart's desire, Spirit without measure. Unto Your name I will bring my sacrifice.
