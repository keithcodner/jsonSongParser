[Verse 1] 
I dream of tongues of fire Resting on Your people, I dream of all the miracles to come. I hope to see the coming Healing of the nations, I long to see the prodigals return. So many hopes and longings in You; When will all the dreams come true?


[Verse 2] 
I'm a believer in Your kingdom, I am a seeker of the new things, I am a dreamer with some old dreams, Let them now come.


[Verse 3] 
I hope to see You come down, Rend the mighty heavens, And let Your glory cover all the earth; To see Your sons and daughters Come to know and love You, And find a purer passion in the church. These are the things my heart will pursue: When will all the dreams come true?


[Verse 4] 
I'm a believer in Your kingdom, I am a seeker of the new things, I am a dreamer with some old dreams, Let them now come.


[Verse 5] 
May Your church now reach out, Sowing truth and justice, Learn to love the poor and help the weak. When Your kingdom's coming It will touch the broken, Place the lonely in a family. So many hopes and longings in You: When will all the dreams come true? 


[Verse 6] 
I'm a believer in Your kingdom, I am a seeker of the new things, I am a dreamer with some old dreams, Let them now come.
