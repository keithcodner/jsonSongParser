[Verse 1] 
One thing I ask, one thing I seek, To see Your face, to gaze upon Your beauty, To search behind the eyes of love.


[Verse 2] 
To spend my days within the veil, Where the purity and light pour over me, And I am changed.


[Verse 3] 
One thing I ask, one thing I seek, To see Your face, to gaze upon Your beauty, To search behind the eyes of love.


[Verse 4] 
All I held close I now let go. All else is loss compared to knowing You, And I am changed.


[Verse 5] 
To spend my days within the veil, Where the purity and light pour over me, And I am changed.


[Verse 6] 
I gaze on the One who so desired Friendship with one as low as me. You left behind Your throne So I'll sing of Your love (sing of Your love).


[Verse 7] 
The King who became the sacrifice, Broken and cursed upon the tree, The Saviour of my soul, Hallelujah, hallelujah.
