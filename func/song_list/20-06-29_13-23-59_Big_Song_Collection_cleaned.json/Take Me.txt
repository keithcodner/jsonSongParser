[Verse 1] 
Hear Your Voice, the gentle whisper That calls from deep within On my knees, my heart it cries out Iâ€™m longing to draw near


[Verse 2] 
Hide me now under the shadow of Your wings Lord into Your presence I will run


[Verse 3] 
Take me away with You I want to be close to You Take me away into the secret place


[Verse 4] 
Take me into Your arms Here in Your presence I belong Take me away into the secret place


[Verse 5] 
Let Your glory fill this place Oh God, oh GodReign Forever
