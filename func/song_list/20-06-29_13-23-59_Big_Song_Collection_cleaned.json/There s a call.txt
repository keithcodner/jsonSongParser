[Verse 1] 
There's a call to the people of Zion, To arise and possess the land; Every town has its heirs to the promise, Every nation its sons of light. ||We have stayed long enough on this mountain, Now we're called to new realms of faith; We are more than a temple of worship, We're an army of praise!


[Verse 2] 
We will go to every place, Sharing mercy and preaching grace, For the fields are white for harvest, And labourers are few. ||No place too dark, no soul too lost For the power of the cross; For His light will shine in darkness, And many will believe, So we will go.


[Verse 3] 
We have drunk of the wine of His presence, We have feasted upon His word; Now we're hungry for works of power, Now we're thirsty to share His love. ||He will give us the ground that we walk on, For the battle belongs to God; Do not fear, for His grace is sufficient, When we're weak, He is strong!


[Verse 4] 
We will go to every place, Sharing mercy and preaching grace, For the fields are white for harvest, And labourers are few. ||No place too dark, no soul too lost For the power of the cross; For His light will shine in darkness, And many will believe, So we will go.
