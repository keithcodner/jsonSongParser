[Verse 1] 
One voice, one mind, one will to see The heart of God revealed in power. Let every nation, tribe and tongue Come seek the Lord and His great love. 


[Verse 2] 
Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray. Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray.


[Verse 3] 
We will not cease, we will not rest Until the Prince of Peace is seen. As God with us, Emmanuel, The hope of all humanity.


[Verse 4] 
Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray. Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray.


[Verse 5] 
A vision burns within my soul That all the world will come to know The healing found at Calvary, That place where truth and mercy meet.


[Verse 6] 
Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray. Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray.


[Verse 7] 
I hear a sound across the earth; It tells me that the time is near. An anthem lifting up His name: Make straight a path - prepare the way.


[Verse 8] 
Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray. Send a revival, send a revival, Send a revival, we pray.
