[Verse 1] 
Worthy, You are worthy, Much more worthy than I've known; I cannot imagine Just how glorious You are. I cannot begin to tell How deep a love You bring; Lord, my ears have heard of You, But now my eyes have seen.


[Verse 2] 
You're worthy, You're worthy, You're worthy, You're worthy to be praised, Forever and a day. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Glory, I give glory To the One who saved my soul. You found me and You freed me From the shame that was my own. I cannot begin to tell How merciful You've been; Lord, my ears have heard of You, Now my eyes have seen.


[Verse 4] 
Glory, I give glory To the One who saved my soul. You found me and You freed me From the shame that was my own. I cannot begin to tell How merciful You've been; Lord, my ears have heard of You, Now my eyes have seen.


[Verse 5] 
Your glory, Your glory, Your glory, Your glory reaches high, So high above the heavens.
