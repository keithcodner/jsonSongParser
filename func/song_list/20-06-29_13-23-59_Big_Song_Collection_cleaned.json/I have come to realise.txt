[Verse 1] 
I have come to realise The glory of the Lord resides In this jar of clay. And if my world is going to see The glory of the Lord revealed, Then my pride must break. ||Then the fragrance of Jesus Will be released, And the glory of God will be revealed In all my world.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, let Your name Be fragrant in me, Like perfume that's poured From this vessel of clay. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
And I will live all my days To be the praise, And I will live all my days To be the praise of Your glory.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, let Your name Be fragrant in me, Like perfume that's poured From this vessel of clay. (Repeat)
