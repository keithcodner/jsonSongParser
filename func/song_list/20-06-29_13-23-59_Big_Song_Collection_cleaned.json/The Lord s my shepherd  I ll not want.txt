[Verse 1] 
The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want. He makes me lie in pastures green. He leads me by the still, Still waters, His goodness restores my soul.


[Verse 2] 
And I will trust in You alone. And I will trust in You alone, For Your endless mercy follows me, Your goodness will lead me home.


[Verse 3] 
He guides my ways in righteousness, And He anoints my head with oil, And my cup, it overflows with joy, I feast on His pure delights.


[Verse 4] 
And I will trust in You alone. And I will trust in You alone, For Your endless mercy follows me, Your goodness will lead me home.


[Verse 5] 
And though I walk the darkest path, I will not fear the evil one, For You are with me, And Your rod and staff Are the comfort I need to know. 


[Verse 6] 
And I will trust in You alone. And I will trust in You alone, For Your endless mercy follows me, Your goodness will lead me home.
