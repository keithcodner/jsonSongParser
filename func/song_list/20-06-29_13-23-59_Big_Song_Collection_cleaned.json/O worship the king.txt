[Verse 1] 
O worship the king, All glorious above; O gratefully sing His power and His love: Our Shield and Defender, The Ancient of Days, Pavilioned in splendour And girded with praise.


[Verse 2] 
O tell of His might, O sing of His grace, Whose robe is the light, Whose canopy space; His chariots of wrath The deep thunder-clouds form, And dark is His path On the wings of the storm.


[Verse 3] 
The earth, with its store Of wonders untold, Almighty, Thy power Hath founded of old; Hath 'stablished it fast, By a changeless decree, And round it hath cast, Like a mantle, the sea.


[Verse 4] 
Thy bountiful care What tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, It shines in the light; It streams from the hills, It descends to the plain, And sweetly distils In the dew and the rain.


[Verse 5] 
Frail children of dust, And feeble as frail, In Thee do we trust, Nor find Thee to fail; Thy mercies how tender, How firm to the end, Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!
