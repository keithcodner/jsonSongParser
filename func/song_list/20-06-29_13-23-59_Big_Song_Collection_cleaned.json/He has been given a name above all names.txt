[Verse 1] 
He has been given a name above all names, In earth and heaven, let all creation claim That Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all. || He is the Victor over satan's reign, His blood has triumphed over sin and shame, Jesus Christ is King and Lord of all.


[Verse 2] 
He is the likeness of Jehovah, Through whom the world was made. By His word the universe is sustained, Every power is subject to His name. || The name of Jesus in victory will resound, In every nation let the good news sound: Jesus Christ is King, and Lord of all.
