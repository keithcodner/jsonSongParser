[Verse 1] 
When [C]peace like a river at[F]tendeth my [C]way,|When [Am]sorrows like [D]sea billows [G]roll; What[C]ever my [F]lot, Thou hast [D]taught me to [G]say,|“It is [C]well, it is [F]well [G]with [C]my soul.”


[Verse 2] 
It is [C]well, (it is [G]well,) With my [G]soul, (with my [C]soul,) It is [F]well, it is [C]well [G]with my [C]soul.


[Verse 3] 
Though [C]Satan should buffet, though [F]trials should [C]come,|Let [Am]this blest as[D]surance con[G]trol, That [C]Christ has re[F]garded my [D]helpless e[G]state,|And hath [C]shed his own [F]blood [G]for my [C]soul.


[Verse 4] 
It is [C]well, (it is [G]well,) With my [G]soul, (with my [C]soul,) It is [F]well, it is [C]well [G]with my [C]soul.


[Verse 5] 
My [C]sin, oh the bliss of this [F]glorious [C]thought!|My [Am]sin, not in [D]part but the [G]whole Is [C]nailed to the [F]cross, and I [D]bear it no [G]more,|Praise the [C]Lord, praise the [F]Lord, [G]O my [C]soul!


[Verse 6] 
It is [C]well, (it is [G]well,) With my [G]soul, (with my [C]soul,) It is [F]well, it is [C]well [G]with my [C]soul.


[Verse 7] 
And, [C]Lord, haste the day when my [F]faith shall be [C]sight,|The [Am]clouds be rolled [D]back as a [G]scroll; The [C]trump shall re[F]sound, and the [D]Lord shall de[G]scend,|Even [C]so, it is [F]well [G]with my [C]soul.


[Verse 8] 
It is [C]well, (it is [G]well,) With my [G]soul, (with my [C]soul,) It is [F]well, it is [C]well [G]with my [C]soul.
