[Verse 1] 
Lord, my heart cries out, 'Glory to the King'; My greatest love in life, I hand You everything: 'Glory, glory', I hear the angels sing.


[Verse 2] 
Open my ears, Let me hear Your voice, To know that sweet sound, Oh, my soul rejoice: 'Glory, glory', I hear the angels sing.


[Verse 3] 
You're the Father to the fatherless, The answer to my dreams. I see You crowned in righteousness, We cry, 'Glory to the King'. ||Comforter to the lonely, The lifter of my head. I see You veiled in majesty; We cry, 'Glory, glory', We cry, 'Glory to the King'.
