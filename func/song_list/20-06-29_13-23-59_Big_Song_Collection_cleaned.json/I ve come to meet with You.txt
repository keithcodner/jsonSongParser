[Verse 1] 
I've come to meet with You, my God, To bless Your heart, my King; To be with You, to know Your love, To give an offering.


[Verse 2] 
And I will seek Your lovely face, Through the veil I'll come, To love You in Your dwelling place, To gaze upon Your throne. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Your grace and love have come to me, You've set this captive free. This child is Yours, You have redeemed For life eternally.


[Verse 4] 
And I will seek Your lovely face, Through the veil I'll come, To love You in Your dwelling place, To gaze upon Your throne. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
I know the punishment You took for me; Thank You, Saviour, for the cost, That set me free, That set me free. 


[Verse 6] 
And I will seek Your lovely face, Through the veil I'll come, To love You in Your dwelling place, To gaze upon Your throne. (Repeat)
