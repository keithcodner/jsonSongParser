[Verse 1] 
There's a new song upon my lips, A song I always knew. Thank You for all that You do. There is fire burning in my heart, A fire of faith in You. I believe all the things we can do.


[Verse 2] 
You're the God of great things, You're the God of great things. I won't hold back my thanks to You. Thank You, thank You, Hey, Jesus, I adore You. Thank You, thank You, Hey, Jesus, I live for You.


[Verse 3] 
There's a beat pounding through my feet, A new dance of thanks to You. I'm tasting the joy found in You. There is courage building in my heart; A strength that comes from You. I'm going to live my life for You.


[Verse 4] 
You're the God of great things, You're the God of great things. I won't hold back my thanks to You. Thank You, thank You, Hey, Jesus, I adore You. Thank You, thank You, Hey, Jesus, I live for You.
