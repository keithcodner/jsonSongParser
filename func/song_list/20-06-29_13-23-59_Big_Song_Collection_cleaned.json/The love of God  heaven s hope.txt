[Verse 1] 
The love of God, heaven's hope; This perfect peace, this rest for my soul. This love divine, portrayed in pain, The cross stands alone, Unfailing love.


[Verse 2] 
This love of God, creation's cry; Perfection portrayed, broken for me. The Author of life has suffered our pain. The cross stands alone, Unfailing love.


[Verse 3] 
The love of God was found in the nails; The love of God was seen in the scars. The light and the life was darkened by death, My hope and salvation carried to life, Unfailing love.


[Verse 4] 
The love of God, written in blood; This empty grave, the stone rolled away! The mercy of God has triumphed in Christ. The cross stands alone, Unfailing love. 


[Verse 5] 
The love of God was found in the nails; The love of God was seen in the scars. The light and the life was darkened by death, My hope and salvation carried to life, Unfailing love.
