[Verse 1] 
I'm working out what it means to follow Jesus, Adding up what it costs to follow Him; Counting the times that His love is multiplying, Realising He took away my sin. ||He's always in my memory; He'll never cancel what He's done for me. When I add it together I calculate Jesus is great, Jesus is great!
