[Verse 1] 
We shall be as one, We shall be as one, He the Father of us all, We His chosen sons; And by His command Take each other's hand, Live our lives in unity, We shall be as one.


[Verse 2] 
We shall be as one, We shall be as one; And by this shall all men know Of the work He has done. Love will take us on Through His precious Son; Love of Him who first loved us, We shall be as one.
