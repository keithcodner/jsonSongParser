[Verse 1] 
Wonderful, so wonderful Is Your unfailing love; Your cross has spoken mercy over me. No eye has seen, no ear has heard, No heart could fully know How glorious, how beautiful You are.


[Verse 2] 
Beautiful One, I love You, Beautiful One, I adore, Beautiful One, my soul must sing.


[Verse 3] 
Powerful, so powerful, Your glory fills the skies, Your mighty works displayed for all to see. The beauty of Your majesty Awakes my heart to sing How marvellous, how wonderful You are.


[Verse 4] 
Beautiful One, I love You, Beautiful One, I adore, Beautiful One, my soul must sing.


[Verse 5] 
You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew, You captured my heart with this love, 'Cause nothing on earth Is as beautiful as You. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
My soul, my soul must sing, My soul, my soul must sing, My soul, my soul must sing, Beautiful One.


[Verse 7] 
Beautiful One, I love You, Beautiful One, I adore, Beautiful One, my soul must sing.
