[Verse 1] 
I am the one with the unclean lips, I am the one whose mind is jaded. I am the one with the impure heart, And all my innocence has faded.


[Verse 2] 
Wash me clean in Your river of mercy. Restore my soul by a clear blue stream. Wash me clean in Your river of mercy, Restore my soul, renew me again.


[Verse 3] 
I am the one whose walk is faithless, I am the one who walks away. I am the one whose debts are many And I am the one who cannot pay.


[Verse 4] 
Wash me clean in Your river of mercy. Restore my soul by a clear blue stream. Wash me clean in Your river of mercy, Restore my soul, renew me again.


[Verse 5] 
You are the Lord who is my fortress; You are the Lord who is my hope. You are the Lord who is my refuge, The only safe place for my soul.


[Verse 6] 
Wash me clean in Your river of mercy. Restore my soul by a clear blue stream. Wash me clean in Your river of mercy, Restore my soul, renew me again.
