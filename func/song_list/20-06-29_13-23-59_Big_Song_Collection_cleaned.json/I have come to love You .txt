[Verse 1] 
I have come to love You, For You have won my heart When You revealed Your love to me. My life will be a witness Of such love and such forgiveness, For You have given me Your peace, And You're everything I need.


[Verse 2] 
I love to sing Your name, To speak about Your fame, You're worthy of my praise. I long to worship You In spirit and in truth, It's all I want to do.


[Verse 3] 
You have come to love me And heal my broken heart, Now I am reaching out to You. Your strength is in my weakness, I'm clinging to Your promise, So let Your work in me shine through In everything I do.


[Verse 4] 
I love to sing Your name, To speak about Your fame, You're worthy of my praise. I long to worship You In spirit and in truth, It's all I want to do.


[Verse 5] 
As I come before You now, Let Your Spirit touch me; I will make this gospel known. Fill me with Your love and power And Your compassion, Through me let Your kingdom come.


[Verse 6] 
I love to sing Your name, To speak about Your fame, You're worthy of my praise. I long to worship You In spirit and in truth, It's all I want to do.
