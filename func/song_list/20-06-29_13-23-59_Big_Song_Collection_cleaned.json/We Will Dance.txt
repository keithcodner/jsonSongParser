[Verse 1] 
Si[D]ng a song of celebration, lift up a shout of praise For the Bridegroom will c[G2]ome the glorious O[D]ne; And [C2]oh,[G2] we will look on his f[D]ace, We'll [C2]go [G2] to a much better pl[D]ace.


[Verse 2] 
Da[D]nce with all your might, lift up your hands and clap for joy: The time's drawing n[G2]ear when He will ap[D]pear; And, [C2]oh,[G2] we will stand by His si[D]de, A st[C2]rong,[G2] pure spotless [Asus]bride.[A]


[Verse 3] 
[D]We will da[C]nce on the st[G]reets that are gol[D]den, The glorious Br[C]ide and the gr[G]eat Son of M[D]an; From ev'ry to[C]ngue and tr[G]ibe and na[D]tion will j[C]oin[G] in the song of the L[D]amb.


[Verse 4]
