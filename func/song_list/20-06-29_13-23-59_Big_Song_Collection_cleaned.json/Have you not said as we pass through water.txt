[Verse 1] 
Have you not said as we pass through water, You will be with us? And You have said as we walk through fire, We will not be burned. ||We are not afraid, for You are with us; We will testify to the honour of Your name. We are witnesses, You have shown us You are the One who can save.


[Verse 2] 
Fill us up and send us out In the power of Your name. Fill us up and send us out In the power of Your name.


[Verse 3] 
Bring them from the west, sons and daughters, Call them for Your praise. Gather from the east all Your children, Coming home again. ||Bring them from afar, all the nations, From the north and south, Drawing all the peoples in. Corners of the earth, come to see there's Only one Saviour and King. 


[Verse 4] 
Fill us up and send us out In the power of Your name. Fill us up and send us out In the power of Your name.
