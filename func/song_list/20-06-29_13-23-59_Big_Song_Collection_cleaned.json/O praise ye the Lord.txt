[Verse 1] 
O praise ye the Lord! Praise Him in the height; Rejoice in His word, Ye angels of light; Ye heavens adore Him By whom ye were made, And worship before Him In brightness arrayed.


[Verse 2] 
O praise ye the Lord! Praise Him upon earth, In tuneful accord, Ye sons of new birth; Praise Him who hath brought you His grace from above, Praise Him who hath taught you To sing of His love.


[Verse 3] 
O praise ye the Lord, All things that give sound; Each jubilant chord, Re-echo around: Loud organs, His glory Forthtell in deep tone, And sweet harp, the story Of what He hath done.


[Verse 4] 
O praise ye the Lord! Thanksgiving and song To Him be outpoured All ages along; For love in creation, For heaven restored, For grace of salvation, O praise ye the Lord!
