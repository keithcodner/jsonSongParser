[Verse 1] 
Open up the skies of mercy, Rain down the cleansing flood; Healing waters rise around us; Hear our cries, Lord, let 'em rise.


[Verse 2] 
It's Your kindness, Lord, that leads us to repentance; Your favour, Lord, is our desire. It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence, And Your love, Your love is better than life.


[Verse 3] 
We can feel Your mercy falling; You are turning our hearts back again. Hear our praises rise to heaven; Draw us near, Lord, meet us here.


[Verse 4] 
It's Your kindness, Lord, that leads us to repentance; Your favour, Lord, is our desire. It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence, And Your love, Your love is better than life.
