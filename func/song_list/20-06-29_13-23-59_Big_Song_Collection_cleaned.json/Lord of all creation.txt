[Verse 1] 
Lord of all creation, Let this generation See a visitation of Your power; Put to flight all the powers of darkness, O come, Lord Jesus, come.


[Verse 2] 
Lord of all creation, Let this generation See a visitation of Your power. Lord of all creation, There's an expectation Rising in this nation every hour.


[Verse 3] 
Father God, forgive us, Send Your cleansing rivers, Wash us now and give us holy power; Fill this land with Your awesome presence, O come, Lord Jesus, come. 


[Verse 4] 
Lord of all creation, Let this generation See a visitation of Your power. Lord of all creation, There's an expectation Rising in this nation every hour.
