[Verse 1] 
[E]Light of the [Bsus]world, You stepped [F#m]down into darkness, [E]Opened my [Bsus]eyes, let me [A]see; [E]Beauty that [Bsus]made this [F#m]heart adore You, [E]Hope of a [Bsus]life spent with [A]You.


[Verse 2] 
Here I am to [E]worship, here I am to [B/D#]bow down, Here I am to [E/G#]say that You're my [A]God; You're altogether [E]lovely, altogether [B/D#]worthy, Altogether [E/G#]wonderful to [A]me.


[Verse 3] 
[E]King of all [Bsus]days, oh so [F#m]highly exalted, [E]Glorious in [Bsus]Heaven a[A]bove; [E]Humbly You [Bsus]came to the [F#m]earth You created, [E]All for loveâ€™s [Bsus]sake became [A]poor.


[Verse 4] 
Here I am to [E]worship, here I am to [B/D#]bow down, Here I am to [E/G#]say that You're my [A]God; You're altogether [E]lovely, altogether [B/D#]worthy, Altogether [E/G#]wonderful to [A]me.


[Verse 5] 
(And) I'll [B/D#]never [E/G#]know how [A]much it cost To [B/D#]see my [E/G#]sin u[A]pon that cross.
