[Verse 1] 
Lord, I come before Your throne of grace; I find rest in Your presence And fulness of joy. In worship and wonder I behold Your face, Singing what a faithful God have I.


[Verse 2] 
What a faithful God have I, What a faithful God. What a faithful God have I, Faithful in every way.


[Verse 3] 
Lord of mercy, You have heard my cry; Through the storm You're the beacon, My song in the night. In the shelter of Your wings, Hear my heart's reply, Singing what a faithful God have I.


[Verse 4] 
What a faithful God have I, What a faithful God. What a faithful God have I, Faithful in every way.


[Verse 5] 
Lord all sovereign, granting peace from heaven, Let me comfort those who suffer With the comfort You have given. I will tell of Your great love For as long as I live, Singing what a faithful God have I. 


[Verse 6] 
What a faithful God have I, What a faithful God. What a faithful God have I, Faithful in every way.
