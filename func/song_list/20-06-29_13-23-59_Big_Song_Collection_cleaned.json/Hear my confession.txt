[Verse 1] 
Hear my confession in Your compassion; Could You lead me in the way that I should go? If I lose my life for You, I know I'll find it; Could Your will become incarnate in my soul?


[Verse 2] 
For I would rather learn to open doors in Your house, Than spend the rest of my days wasted somewhere else. For I could never be free or feel Your peace Till I surrender to Your love.


[Verse 3] 
Take my whole heart; I won't hold back the least part. I wanna fall face forward Into the arms of grace. Oh, may my passion become so undivided That I won't be satisfied with nothing less, Nothing less than You.


[Verse 4] 
Could You give me a hunger for Your kingdom, That my own desires would all take second place?


[Verse 5] 
Take my whole heart; I won't hold back the least part. I wanna fall face forward Into the arms of grace. Oh, may my passion become so undivided That I won't be satisfied with nothing less, Nothing less than You.
