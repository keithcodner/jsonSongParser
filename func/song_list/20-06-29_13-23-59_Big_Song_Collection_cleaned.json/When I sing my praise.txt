[Verse 1] 
When I sing my praise to You, I am lifted up to higher ground. Something happens in my soul When I lift my voice to worship You. Feels like sunshine on my face, A cool breeze in a desert place. 


[Verse 2] 
When I worship You, Heaven comes to me, Heaven comes to me. When I worship You, Heaven comes to me, Heaven comes to me. 


[Verse 3] 
Heaven is where I belong, Where the angels sing before Your throne. I am caught up in their sound, When I lift my voice to worship You. From beyond where eyes can see, Love is pouring over me.


[Verse 4] 
When I worship You, Heaven comes to me, Heaven comes to me. When I worship You, Heaven comes to me, Heaven comes to me. 


[Verse 5] 
I will worship You, Heaven come to me, Heaven come to me. I will worship You, Heaven come to me, Heaven come to me.
