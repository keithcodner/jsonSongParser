You began with just one man, A covenant with Abraham, Promising that through his seed The nations would be blessed, And now Your plan is manifest.


[Verse 5] 
Does God speak and then not act? Make a vow and not fulfil? I will choose to serve the Lord Wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly.


[Verse 6] 
Deliver us from the fear of man, And by Your grace we shall stand. We'll call to mind Your mighty works And Your acts of sovereign power; We'll gather strength as we agree The battle belongs to the Lord.

You began with just one man, A covenant with Abraham, Promising that through his seed The nations would be blessed, And now Your plan is manifest.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, raise up a church With a different spirit, Like Caleb's spirit, believing Your word. Oh, raise up a church who will not sin, They press on in to possess the land.


[Verse 9] 
Oh, raise up a church who walk by faith, In the fear of God they overcome. Oh, raise up a church Whose God is with them, They walk in wisdom, they fear no harm.


[Verse 10] 
Oh, raise up a church Who revere Your judgements, They lift up a banner of mercy and love. Oh, raise up a church Who'll not keep silent, They speak of the glory of Your dear Son.
