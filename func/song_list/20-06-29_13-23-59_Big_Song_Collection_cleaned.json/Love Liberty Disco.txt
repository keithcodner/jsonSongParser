[Verse 1] 
And if I [F#m7]told you that somebody did [D]love you, would you [F#m7]say|"Hey show me that [D]face;" And if I [F#m7]told you that true freedom was [D]actual, would you [F#m7]say|"Hey, take me to that [D]place?"|| And if [F#m7]I said there is a [D]family: a [F#m7]body that moves as [D]one; [F#m7]Do you feel the love that invites [D]us, the liberty excites us, The [F#m7]disco has just be[D]gun, has just be[G]gun.


[Verse 2] 
Give me [D]love, give me liberty [G]disco: a place every[D]body in the family's [G]found; On that day, [D]we will all be happy [G]people, when love liber[D]ty disco's in [G]town.


[Verse 3] 
And as we [F#m7]step into the light of the [D]Lover, we're all the [F#m7]same, there's no rich or [D]poor; And you [F#m7]know it's never been good for a man to [D]be alone, So come on [F#m7]in, your name's on the [D]door, what are we [G]waiting for?


[Verse 4] 
Give me [D]love, give me liberty [G]disco: a place every[D]body in the family's [G]found; On that day, [D]we will all be happy [G]people, when love liber[D]ty disco's in [G]town.


[Verse 5] 
[Bm] All our [A]fears are turning [G]'round, fall [F#m]down, and meet your [D]Maker, Where our [A]true selves will be [G]found, calling [F#m]out to every lonely [D]soul.


[Verse 6] 
Give me [D]love, give me liberty [G]disco: a place every[D]body in the family's [G]found; On that day, [D]we will all be happy [G]people, when love liber[D]ty disco's in [G]town.
