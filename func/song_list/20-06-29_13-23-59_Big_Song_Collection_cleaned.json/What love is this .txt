[Verse 1] 
What love is this? The love of Jesus, That gave its all, that cost His life. Flesh torn by nails, life cruelly taken, The Father's Son, love's sacrifice.


[Verse 2] 
And I thank You, Lord, for loving me, And I lift my hands so gratefully. And I thank You, Lord, that I can be A child of Yours eternally.


[Verse 3] 
You are my King, You are my Saviour, You'll always be a friend to me. Safe in Your arms now and forever Your love shines bright, my morning star.


[Verse 4] 
And I thank You, Lord, for loving me, And I lift my hands so gratefully. And I thank You, Lord, that I can be A child of Yours eternally.


[Verse 5] 
Now let Your power rain down upon me; Such peace and joy cascading down. May Your love touch all those around me; I'll shine for You, I'll shine for You.


[Verse 6] 
And I thank You, Lord, for loving me, And I lift my hands so gratefully. And I thank You, Lord, that I can be A child of Yours eternally.
