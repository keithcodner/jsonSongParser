[Verse 1] 
When you've been broken, broken to pieces, And your heart begins to faint, 'Cause you don't understand. ||And when there is nothing To rake from the ashes, And you can't even walk Onto the fields of praise. But I bow down and kiss the Son. Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.


[Verse 2] 
When the rock falls, falls upon you, And you get ground to dust, No music for your pain. ||You open the windows, The windows of heaven, And then You opened me, And You crushed me like a rose. But I bow down and kiss the Son. Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son. Oh, I bow down and kiss the Son.


[Verse 3] 
Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth, Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth. Though You slay me, I will trust You, Lord. (Repeat x4)
