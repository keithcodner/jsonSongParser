[Verse 1] 
Have I not been faithful to You, Lord? Have I not offered up my prayers And tried to follow Your word? Lord, will You search me, Show me where I'm wrong?


[Verse 2] 
I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long, I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long.


[Verse 3] 
Now Lord, forgive me, For speaking this right out. But I see the wicked prosper While the godly go without. No, I can't read human hearts, But do You know where I'm coming from?


[Verse 4] 
I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long, I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long.


[Verse 5] 
Do not be angry with me, O my God, Please don't hide Your face away. I'm like a child, and I'm down on my knees And I'm begging for You Just to bless me today.


[Verse 6] 
I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long, I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long.


[Verse 7] 
Lord, up ahead You know I see a lonely road. Got this burden on my back, It's such a heavy load. These days I've questions, But there's no answers in my songs.


[Verse 8] 
I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long, I've been waiting for the blessing For far too long.
