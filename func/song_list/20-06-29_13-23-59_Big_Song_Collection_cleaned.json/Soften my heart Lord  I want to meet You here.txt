[Verse 1] 
Soften my heart Lord, I want to meet You here. Soften my heart Lord, tender me with tears, For Your presence is beyond anything I could desire; Soften my heart Lord, consume me with Your holy fire.


[Verse 2] 
Soften my heart Lord, I have made a choice. Soften my heart Lord, I want to hear Your voice, For Your presence is beyond anything I could desire; Soften my heart Lord, consume me with Your holy fire.
