[Verse 1] 
When my heart runs dry And there's no song to sing, No holy melody, No words of love within, I recall the height from which This fragile heart has slipped.


[Verse 2] 
And I'll remember You, I will turn back and do The things I used to do For the love of You. Lord, I'll remember You, I will turn back and do The things I need to do For the love You.


[Verse 3] 
You are my soul's desire, You are the hope within, You bring my heart to life, You make my spirit sing. I recall the height from which This fragile heart has slipped.


[Verse 4] 
And I'll remember You, I will turn back and do The things I used to do For the love of You. Lord, I'll remember You, I will turn back and do The things I need to do For the love You.
