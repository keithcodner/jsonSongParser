When I call [F#]on Jesus, all things ar[C#]e possible. I can[B] mount on wings [F#]like ea[C#]gles and soar. When I call on [F#]Jesus, mountains are g[C#]onna fall. 'Cause He'll[B] move heaven and[F#] ea[B]rth to c[C#]ome rescue m[F#]e when I call.|| La la [D]laaaa [E]laaa[B]a la. La la [D]laaaa [E]laaa[B]a la.
