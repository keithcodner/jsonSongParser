[Verse 1] 
Rise up, you champions of God, Rise up, you royal nation; Rise up, and bear His light abroad, We'll reach this generation. We've got our marching orders, We've got our marching orders; Now is the time to carry them forth.


[Verse 2] 
Go forth! Jesus loves them. Go forth! Take the gospel. Go forth! The time is now. The harvest is ripening: Go forth!


[Verse 3] 
Feel now the burden of the Lord, Feel how He longs to save them; Feel now for those who never heard About the Son He gave them. We've got our marching orders, We've got our marching orders; Now is the time to carry them forth. 


[Verse 4] 
Go forth! Jesus loves them. Go forth! Take the gospel. Go forth! The time is now. The harvest is ripening: Go forth!
