[Verse 1] 
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
And He is precious in God's sight, So precious in His eyes.


[Verse 3] 
Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb. Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.


[Verse 4] 
And He is precious in God's sight, So precious in His eyes.


[Verse 5] 
Glory, I give glory to the Lamb of God. Glory, I give glory to the Lamb of God. 


[Verse 6] 
And He is precious in God's sight, So precious in His eyes.
