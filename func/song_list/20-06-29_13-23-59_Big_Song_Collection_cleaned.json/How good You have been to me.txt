[Verse 1] 
How good You have been to me, Forever faithful. How true are Your promises, Never shaken. You are the Light of my life, You are the reason I live.


[Verse 2] 
I live for You, I place no one above You. I'll walk with You always, always. To talk with You, And feel Your breath on my face, How amazing, How amazing You are!


[Verse 3] 
How rich is Your word, O Lord, At work within me. How soft is Your voice I hear, That gently calls me. Each day I wake to Your love; I know that I am blessed of God!


[Verse 4] 
I live for You, I place no one above You. I'll walk with You always, always. To talk with You, And feel Your breath on my face, How amazing, How amazing You are!
