[Verse 1] 
How [G]firm [C]a foun[G]dation, ye [G]saints of the [D]Lord, Is [G]laid [C]for your [G]faith [Em]in His [G/D]ex[D7]cellent [G]word! What [G]more can He [Em]say than to [G]you He hath [D]said, To [G]you [C]who for [G]re[Em]fuge to [G/D]Je[D7]sus hath [G]fled.


[Verse 2] 
"Fear [G]not, [C]I am [G]with thee, O [G]be not dis[D]mayed, For [G]I [C]am your [G]God, [Em]and will [G/D]still [D7]give thee [G]aid; I'll [G]strengthen thee, [Em]help thee and [G]cause thee to [D]stand, Up[G]held [C]by My [G]right[Em]eous, om[G/D]ni[D7]potent [G]hand."


[Verse 3] 
"When [G]through [C]the deep [G]waters I [G]call thee to [D]go, The [G]ri[C]vers of [G]sor[Em]row shall [G/D]not [D7]over[G]flow; For I[G] will be [Em]with thee, thy [G]troubles to [D]bless, And [G]sanc[C]tify [G]to [Em]thee thy [G/D]deep[D7]est dis[G]tress."


[Verse 4] 
"When [G]through [C]fiery [G]trials thy [G]pathway shall [D]lie, My [G]grace, [C]all suf[G]fi[Em]cient shall [G/D]be [D7]thy sup[G]ply; The f[G]lame shall not [Em]hurt thee; I [G]only de[D]sign Thy [G]dross [C]to con[G]sume, [Em]and thy [G/D]gold [D7]to re[G]fine."


[Verse 5] 
"The [G]soul [C]that on [G]Jesus hath [G]leaned for re[D]pose, I [G]will [C]not, I [G]will [Em]not de[G/D]sert [D7]to his [G]foes; That [G]soul, though all [Em]hell should en[G]deavor to [D]shake, I'll [G]ne[C]ver, no [G]ne[Em]ver, no [G/D]ne[D7]ver for[G]sake!"
