[Verse 1] 
 I find You in the secret place I find You on the mountain I find You in the early hours Of my day|| I find You when I’m waiting I find You when I’m in Your Word I find You when I’m talking to You When I pray


[Verse 2] 
 Create in me a clean heart As I come away with You|| Wash away all of my stains And restore to me the joy I have in You


[Verse 3] 
 You are my hiding You are my hiding place
