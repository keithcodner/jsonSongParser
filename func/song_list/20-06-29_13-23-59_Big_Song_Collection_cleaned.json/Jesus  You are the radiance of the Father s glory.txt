[Verse 1] 
Jesus, You are the radiance Of the Father's glory, You are the Son, The appointed heir, Through whom all things are made. || You are the One who sustains All things by Your powerful word. You have purified us from sin, You are exalted, O Lord, Exalted, O Lord, To the right hand of God.


[Verse 2] 
Crowned with glory, Crowned with honour, We worship You.
