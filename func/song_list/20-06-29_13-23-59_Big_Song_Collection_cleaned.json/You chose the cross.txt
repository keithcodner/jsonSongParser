[Verse 1] 
You chose the cross with every breath, The perfect life, the perfect death: You chose the cross. ||A crown of thorns You wore for us, And crowned us with eternal life: You chose the cross. And though Your soul was overwhelmed with pain, Obedient to death You overcame.


[Verse 2] 
I'm lost in wonder, I'm lost in love, I'm lost in praise forevermore. Because of Jesus' unfailing love I am forgiven, I am restored.


[Verse 3] 
You loosed the cords of sinfulness And broke the chains of my disgrace: You chose the cross. ||Up from the grave victorious, You rose again so glorious: You chose the cross. The sorrow that surrounded You was mine, 'Yet not My will but Yours be done!' You cried.


[Verse 4] 
I'm lost in wonder, I'm lost in love, I'm lost in praise forevermore. Because of Jesus' unfailing love I am forgiven, I am restored.
