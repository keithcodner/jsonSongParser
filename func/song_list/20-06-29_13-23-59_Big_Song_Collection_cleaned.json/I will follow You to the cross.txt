[Verse 1] 
I will follow You to the cross And lay myself down, lay myself down. I will follow You to the cross, And lay myself down, lay myself down.


[Verse 2] 
Rid me of these dirty clothes, Cleanse me from all this pollution. I choose to walk in purity, Oh, purify me, purify me.


[Verse 3] 
I will follow You to the cross And lay myself down, lay myself down. I will follow You to the cross, And lay myself down, lay myself down.


[Verse 4] 
Kiss me with Your healing touch, Take me to the heat of the fire; Bathe me in Your liquid love, Oh, saturate me, saturate me.


[Verse 5] 
I will follow You to the cross And lay myself down, lay myself down. I will follow You to the cross, And lay myself down, lay myself down.


[Verse 6] 
Humbly I stand, humbly I kneel, Humbly I fall at Your throne. With a craving for You That no words can describe: Saturate me, saturate me; Saturate me, saturate me; Purify me, purify me; Purify me, purify me; Purify me, purify me. 


[Verse 7] 
I will follow You to the cross And lay myself down, lay myself down. I will follow You to the cross, And lay myself down, lay myself down.
