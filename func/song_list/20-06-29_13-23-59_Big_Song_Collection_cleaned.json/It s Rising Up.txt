[Verse 1] 
It's [E]rising up from coast to coast, From north to south, and [C#m7]east to [B]west; The [E]cry of hearts that love Your name, Which with one voice we [C#m7]will pro[B]clai[E]m.


[Verse 2] 
The [E]former things have taken place, Can this be the new [C#m7]day of [B]praise? A [E]heav'nly song that comes to birth, And reaches out to [C#m7]all the [B]earth


[Verse 3] 
Oh [F#m7]let the cry to [E/G#]nations ring, That [A]all may come and [B]all may sing:


[Verse 4] 
'[E]Holy [A]is the [E]Lord'| (Every heart [B/Eb]sing) '[C#m7]Holy [A]is the [B]Lord'| (With one voice [A/C#]sing) '[E]Holy [A]is the [E]Lord'| (All the earth [B/Eb]sing) '[C#m7]Holy [A]is the [B]Lord'[A/C#][E]


[Verse 5] 
And we have heard the lion's roar, That speaks of heaven's love and power. Is this the time, is this the call That ushers in Your kingdom rule? Oh let the cry to nations ring, That all may come and all may sing:


[Verse 6] 
'Jesus is alive'| (Every heart sing) 'Jesus is alive'| (With one voice sing) 'Jesus is alive'| (All the earth sing) 'Jesus is alive'
