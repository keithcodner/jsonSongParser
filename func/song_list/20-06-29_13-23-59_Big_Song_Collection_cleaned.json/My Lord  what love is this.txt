[Verse 1] 
My Lord, what love is this That pays so dearly, That I, the guilty one, May go free!


[Verse 2] 
My Lord, what love is this That pays so dearly, That I, the guilty one, May go free!


[Verse 3] 
And so they watched Him die, Despised, rejected; But oh, the blood He shed Flowed for me!


[Verse 4] 
My Lord, what love is this That pays so dearly, That I, the guilty one, May go free!


[Verse 5] 
And now, this love of Christ Shall flow like rivers; Come wash your guilt away, Live again! 


[Verse 6] 
And so they watched Him die, Despised, rejected; But oh, the blood He shed Flowed for me!


[Verse 7] 
Amazing love, O what sacrifice, The Son of God given for me. My debt He pays, and my death Hedies, That I might live, that I might live. 


[Verse 8] 
Amazing love, O what sacrifice, The Son of God given for me. My debt He pays, and my death Hedies, That I might live, that I might live. That I might live!
