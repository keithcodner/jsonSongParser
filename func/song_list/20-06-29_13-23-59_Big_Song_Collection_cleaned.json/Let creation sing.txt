[Verse 1] 
 The whole earth Overflowing With Your power And Your glory|| There is no one like You God There is no one like You God|| 


[Verse 2] 
 Mountains bow Nations tremble At Your feet we cry holy|| There is no one like You God There is no one like You God ||


[Verse 3] 
 Let creation sing of the risen King Let the universe resound With a shout of love We will give to You All the highest praise ||


[Verse 4] 
 Let Your light Shine upon us Let Your light || Shine upon us For the glory of Your Name Will be over all the earth|| 


[Verse 5] 
 Forever Forever I’ll sing Forever Forever I’ll sing ||
