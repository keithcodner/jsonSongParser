[Verse 1] 
I love You more each day, With all my heart can give; Worship at Your feet, Lost within Your gaze. ||Just to know that You're near, My treasure is here, That You gave Your life To save me; How my heart sings with praise And calls on Your name, My Saviour, my Lover, my King, Come to me again!
