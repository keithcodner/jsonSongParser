[Verse 1] 
May the words of my mouth, And the thoughts of my heart Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus: And the deeds of the day, And the truth in my ways, Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
For this is what I'm glad to do, It's time to live a life of love That pleases You. And I will give my all to You, Surrender everything I have and follow You, I'll follow You.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, will You be my vision, Lord, will You be my guide: Be my hope, be my light, and the way? And I'll look not for riches, Nor praises on earth, Only You'll be the first of my heart.


[Verse 4] 
For this is what I'm glad to do, It's time to live a life of love That pleases You. And I will give my all to You, Surrender everything I have and follow You, I'll follow You.


[Verse 5] 
I will follow, I will follow You. I will follow, I will follow You. I will follow, I will follow You. I will follow, I will follow You.


[Verse 6] 
For this is what I'm glad to do, It's time to live a life of love That pleases You. And I will give my all to You, Surrender everything I have and follow You, I'll follow You.
