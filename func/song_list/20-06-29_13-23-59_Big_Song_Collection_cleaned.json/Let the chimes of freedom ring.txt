[Verse 1] 
Let the chimes of freedom ring All across this earth; Lift your voice in praise to Him And sing of all His worth, And sing of all His worth.


[Verse 2] 
Open wide your prison doors To greet the Lord of life; Songs of triumph fill the air, Christ Jesus is alive, Christ Jesus is alive.


[Verse 3] 
Let the chimes of freedom ring All across this earth; Lift your voice in praise to Him And sing of all His worth, And sing of all His worth.


[Verse 4] 
In every corner of this earth, To every tribe and tongue, Make known that God so loved this world That He gave His only Son, He gave His only Son.


[Verse 5] 
Spread the news and make it plain, He breaks the power of sin; Jesus died and He rose again, His love will never end, His love will never end.


[Verse 6] 
Let the chimes of freedom ring All across this earth; Lift your voice in praise to Him And sing of all His worth, And sing of all His worth.


[Verse 7] 
He will return in majesty To take His rightful place As the King of all eternity, The Name above all names, The Name above all names. 


[Verse 8] 
Let the chimes of freedom ring All across this earth; Lift your voice in praise to Him And sing of all His worth, And sing of all His worth.


[Verse 9] 
Let all the people hear the news Of the One who comes to save: He's the Lord of all the universe, And forever He shall reign. And forever more, yes forever more, And forever more He will reign. (Repeat)
