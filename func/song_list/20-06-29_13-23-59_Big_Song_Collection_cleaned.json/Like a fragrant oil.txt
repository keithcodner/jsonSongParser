[Verse 1] 
Like a fragrant oil, Like costly perfume poured out, Let my worship be to You. Like a fervent prayer, Like incense rising to Your throne, In spirit and in truth.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, You alone are worthy of my praise, I owe my life to You. Jesus, You alone can make me holy, So I bow before You.


[Verse 3] 
Like a wedding vow, 'All I am I give to You', Let my sacrifice be pure. Like the sweetest sound, Like a lover's whisper in Your ear, I've set my heart on You.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, You alone are worthy of my praise, I owe my life to You. Jesus, You alone can make me holy, So I bow before You.
