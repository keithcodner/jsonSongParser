[Verse 1] 
This is the best place, This is the right place, And we have confidence now to enter: Let us draw near now, With hearts sincere now, In full assurance, To worship Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
We're worshipping the living God! We're worshipping the living God! We're worshipping the living God! We're worshipping the living God!


[Verse 3] 
Let us consider, For one another, The way to love more, As the day approaches. Let us draw near now, With hearts sincere now; Let's meet together To worship Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
We're worshipping the living God! We're worshipping the living God! We're worshipping the living God! We're worshipping the living God!
