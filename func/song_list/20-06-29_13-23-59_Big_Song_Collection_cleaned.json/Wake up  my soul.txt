[Verse 1] 
Wake up, my soul, Worship the Lord of truth and life. Have strength, my heart, Press on as one who seeks the prize. I'll run for You, my God and King, I'll run as one who runs to win. I'm pressing on, not giving in. I will run, I will run for You, my King.


[Verse 2] 
And Spirit come, give life to us, Come breathe the Father's love in us. Won't You fill us once again? And we will run and run with Him. ||We'll run with strength, With all our might, We'll fix our eyes on Jesus Christ; He has conquered death and sin, And we will run and run and run With Him.
