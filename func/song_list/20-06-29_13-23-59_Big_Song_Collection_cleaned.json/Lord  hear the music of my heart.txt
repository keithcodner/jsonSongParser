[Verse 1] 
Lord, hear the music of my heart; Hear all the pourings of my soul. Songs telling of a life of love: Jesus, this is all for You. ||You've become the ruler of my heart; You've become the lover of my soul. You've become the Saviour of this life: You are everything to me. 


[Verse 2] 
(Oh now,) Jesus, Jesus, I will pour my praise on You. Worship, worship, Demonstrates my love for You. ||May I come to Be a blessing to Your heart. Jesus, Jesus, Who can tell how wonderful You are, How wonderful You are!


[Verse 3] 
(Oh now,) Jesus, Jesus, I will pour my praise on You. Worship, worship, Demonstrates my love for You. ||May I come to Be a blessing to Your heart. Jesus, Jesus, Who can tell how wonderful You are, How wonderful You are! O, how wonderful You are.
