[Verse 1] 
I have found such joy in my salvation Since I gave my heart to You, I have found the reason I'm living, So in love, so near to You.


[Verse 2] 
I worship You, my Lord, With all my life, praise Your name. I worship You, worship You, my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Oh my Lord, my life I'm giving, A living sacrifice to You. Oh my Lord, the reason I'm living Is to serve and worship You. 


[Verse 4] 
I worship You, my Lord, With all my life, praise Your name. I worship You, worship You, my Lord.
