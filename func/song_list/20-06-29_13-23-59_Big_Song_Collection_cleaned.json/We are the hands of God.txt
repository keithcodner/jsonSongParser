[Verse 1] 
We are the hands of God, Our task to do His will, To lay our hands upon this world, And by His Spirit see it healed.


[Verse 2] 
We are the Church invincible, The flesh and blood of Christ. We are the Gospel visible, Our lives the Saviour's light to the world.


[Verse 3] 
We are the word of God, And by the things we say This world will judge the Prince of life And be drawn in or turn away.


[Verse 4] 
We are the Church invincible, The flesh and blood of Christ. We are the Gospel visible, Our lives the Saviour's light to the world.


[Verse 5] 
We are the feet of God, Who walk the narrow way, And every step we take is watched By those for whom we fast and pray.


[Verse 6] 
We are the Church invincible, The flesh and blood of Christ. We are the Gospel visible, Our lives the Saviour's light to the world.


[Verse 7] 
Though persecution comes, And governments oppose, Beneath the crushing weight of law The church of Jesus grows and grows. 


[Verse 8] 
We are the Church invincible, The flesh and blood of Christ. We are the Gospel visible, Our lives the Saviour's light to the world.
