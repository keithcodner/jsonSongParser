[Verse 1] 
Well, I thank You, Lord, That You are my Saviour; You're my strength And You're the Rock on which I stand. You give me life, And a grace that's greater, When I humble myself Beneath Your mighty hand.


[Verse 2] 
You bring times of refreshing, You bring times of refreshing, You bring times of refreshing to my soul. When I'm weary from the fight, And trying to do what's right, You bring times of refreshing to my soul.


[Verse 3] 
For the day will come When we'll all be gathered, And the sun will rise with healing in its wings; And all the years of pain Won't seem to matter, When our eyes behold Our Teacher and our King. 


[Verse 4] 
You bring times of refreshing, You bring times of refreshing, You bring times of refreshing to my soul. When I'm weary from the fight, And trying to do what's right, You bring times of refreshing to my soul.
