[Verse 1] 
Let us run with perseverance The race set out before us; Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, The Author and Perfecter of our faith.


[Verse 2] 
In the beginning The Word was with God, Through Him all of us were made; He began a work in us, A good work to perfect Until He returns again.


[Verse 3] 
Let us run with perseverance The race set out before us; Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, The Author and Perfecter of our faith.


[Verse 4] 
Since we are surrounded By heaven's cheering crowd, Let us throw off every chain: For all that opposes us, Look to Jesus who endured So we'll not lose heart again.


[Verse 5] 
Let us run with perseverance The race set out before us; Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, The Author and Perfecter of our faith.


[Verse 6] 
For the joy before Him, He suffered the cross, He defeated death and shame; Now He reigns in glory At the right hand of God â€“ He is calling us by name.


[Verse 7] 
Let us run with perseverance The race set out before us; Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, The Author and Perfecter of our faith.
