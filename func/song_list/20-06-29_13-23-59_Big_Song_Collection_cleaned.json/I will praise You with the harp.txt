[Verse 1] 
I will praise You with the harp For Your faithfulness, O my God. I will sing my praise to You With the lyre, with the lyre.


[Verse 2] 
O Holy One of Israel, (x3) My lips will shout for joy, My lips will shout for joy. When I sing my praise to You, (x3) For I have been redeemed, I have been redeemed! ||I'll speak of all Your righteous acts, (x3) And tell them all day long, And tell them all day long.


[Verse 3] 
Those who want to harm me Are put to shame and confused. I will sing my praise to You With the lyre, with the lyre.


[Verse 4] 
O Holy One of Israel, (x3) My lips will shout for joy, My lips will shout for joy. When I sing my praise to You, (x3) For I have been redeemed, I have been redeemed! ||I'll speak of all Your righteous acts, (x3) And tell them all day long, And tell them all day long.


[Verse 5] 
I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed! I've been redeemed, I've been redeemed! 


[Verse 6] 
O Holy One of Israel, (x3) My lips will shout for joy, My lips will shout for joy. When I sing my praise to You, (x3) For I have been redeemed, I have been redeemed! ||I'll speak of all Your righteous acts, (x3) And tell them all day long, And tell them all day long.
