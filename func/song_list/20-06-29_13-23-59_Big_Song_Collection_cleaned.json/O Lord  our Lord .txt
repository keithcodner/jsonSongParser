[Verse 1] 
O Lord, our Lord, Your name is great And greatly to be praised. In heaven and the universe, Your glory is displayed. Every knee must bow to You And every tongue confess: You are Lord, the Son of God, Risen from the dead.


[Verse 2] 
You're Jesus, Ruler of the universe. Majestic is Your name in all the earth. Kingdoms rise, kingdoms fall, You are still the Lord of all. Majestic is Your name Here on earth.


[Verse 3] 
When I see the moon and stars Created by Your breath; Why did You consider me Worthy of Your death? When I was the guilty one You took away my shame: When I called, You hid me in The refuge of Your name.


[Verse 4] 
You're Jesus, Ruler of the universe. Majestic is Your name in all the earth. Kingdoms rise, kingdoms fall, You are still the Lord of all. Majestic is Your name Here on earth.
