[Verse 1] 
Soften my heart, That I may know The love You have for me, More than words or well-worn phrases.


[Verse 2] 
Soften my heart, For love to grow, The love I have for You, That keeps my motives pure andblameless.


[Verse 3] 
Enter in, Come and have free reign As I walk with You today. Risen Lamb, Holy One, Overshadow me today.
