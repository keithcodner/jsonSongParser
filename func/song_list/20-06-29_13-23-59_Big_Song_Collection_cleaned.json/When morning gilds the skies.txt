[Verse 1] 
When morning gilds the skies My heart awaking cries: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!' Alike at work and prayer To Jesus I repair: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'


[Verse 2] 
Does sadness fill my mind? A solace here I find: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!' When evil thoughts molest, With this I shield my breast: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'


[Verse 3] 
To God, the Word, on high The hosts of angels cry: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!' Let mortals, too, upraise Their voice in hymns of praise: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'


[Verse 4] 
Let earth's wide circle round In joyful notes resound: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!' Let air, and sea, and sky, From depth to height, reply: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'


[Verse 5] 
Be this while life is mine My canticle divine: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!' Be this the eternal song, Through all the ages long: 'May Jesus Christ be praised!'
