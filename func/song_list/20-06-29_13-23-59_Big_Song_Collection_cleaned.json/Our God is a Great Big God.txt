[Verse 1] 
Our God is a great big God, Our God is a great big God, Our God is a great big God And He holds us in His hands.


[Verse 2] 
He's higher than a skyscraper, And He's deeper than a submarine. He's wider than the universe And beyond my wildest dreams. || And He's known me and He's loved me Since before the world began How wonderful to be a part of God's amazing plan.
