[Verse 1] 
There's an awesome sound On the winds of heaven, Mighty thunder clouds In the skies above. The immortal King, Who will reign forever, Is reaching out with His arms of love, His arms of love, His arms of love.


[Verse 2] 
All creation sings Of the Lamb of glory, Who laid down His life For all the world. What amazing love, That the King of heaven Should be crucified, Stretching out His arms, His arms of love, His arms of love.


[Verse 3] 
Send revival to this land, Fill this nation with Your love. Send revival to this land, Fill this nation with Your love.
