[Verse 1] 
My [E]hope is built on [B]nothing less than [A]Jesus' blood and [B]righteous[E]ness; I [E]dare not trust the [B]sweetest frame, but [A]wholly lean on [B]Jesus' [E]name.


[Verse 2] 
On [E]Christ, the solid [A]rock I stand; All [E]other ground is sinking [B]sand, All [A]other ground is [B]sinking [E]sand.


[Verse 3] 
When [E]darkness veils His [B]lovely face, I [A]rest on His un[B]changing [E]grace. In [E]every high and [B]stormy gale, my [A]anchor holds with[B]in the [E]veil.


[Verse 4] 
On [E]Christ, the solid [A]rock I stand; All [E]other ground is sinking [B]sand, All [A]other ground is [B]sinking [E]sand.


[Verse 5] 
His [E]oath, His cove[B]nant, His blood|sup[A]port me in the [B]whelming [E]flood; When [E]all around my [B]soul gives way, He [A]then is all my [B]hope and [E]stay.


[Verse 6] 
On [E]Christ, the solid [A]rock I stand; All [E]other ground is sinking [B]sand, All [A]other ground is [B]sinking [E]sand.


[Verse 7] 
When [E]He shall come with [B]trumpet sound, O [A]may I then in [B]Him be [E]found; Dressed [E]in His righteous[B]ness alone, fault[A]less to stand be[B]fore the [E]throne.


[Verse 8] 
On [E]Christ, the solid [A]rock I stand; All [E]other ground is sinking [B]sand, All [A]other ground is [B]sinking [E]sand.
