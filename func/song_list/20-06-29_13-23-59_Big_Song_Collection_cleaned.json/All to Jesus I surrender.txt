All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give; I will ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live.

I surrender all, I surrender all, All to Thee, my blessèd Saviour, I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender, Humbly at His feet I bow; Worldly pleasures all forsaken, Take me, Jesus, take me now.


[Verse 4] 
I surrender all, I surrender all, All to Thee, my blessèd Saviour, I surrender all.

I surrender all, I surrender all, All to Thee, my blessèd Saviour, I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give myself to Thee; Fill me with Thy love and power, Let Thy blessing fall on me.
