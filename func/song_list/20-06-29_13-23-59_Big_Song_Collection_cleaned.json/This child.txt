[Verse 1] 
This child, secretly comes in the night, O this Child, hiding a heavenly light, O this Child, coming to us like a stranger, This heavenly Child.


[Verse 2] 
This Child, heaven come down now To be with us here, Heavenly love and mercy appear, Softly in awe and wonder come near - To this heavenly Child.


[Verse 3] 
This Child, rising on us like the sun, O this Child, given to light everyone, O this Child, guiding our feet on the pathway To peace on earth.


[Verse 4] 
This Child, heaven come down now To be with us here, Heavenly love and mercy appear, Softly in awe and wonder come near - To this heavenly Child.


[Verse 5] 
This Child, raising the humble and poor, O this Child, making the proud ones to fall; O this Child, filling the hungry with good things, This heavenly Child.


[Verse 6] 
This Child, heaven come down now To be with us here, Heavenly love and mercy appear, Softly in awe and wonder come near - To this heavenly Child.
