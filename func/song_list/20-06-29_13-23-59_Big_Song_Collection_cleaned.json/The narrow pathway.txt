[Verse 1] 
The narrow pathway Through the needle's eye, I'm stepping forward To the place I die.


[Verse 2] 
For I know that You are faithful, As we walk these fields of white. To the waiting and the humble Your kingdom comes.


[Verse 3] 
The way of mercy Takes me to the least, Down the road of suffering To the wedding feast. For I know that You are faithful, As we walk these fields of white. To the weary and the hurting Your kingdom comes.
