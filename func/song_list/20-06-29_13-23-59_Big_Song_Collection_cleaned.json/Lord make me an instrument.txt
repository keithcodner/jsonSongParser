[Verse 1] 
Lord make me an instrument, An instrument of worship; I lift up my hands in Your name. Lord make me an instrument, An instrument of worship; I lift up my hands in Your name.


[Verse 2] 
I'll sing You a love song, A love song of worship, I'll lift up my hands in Your name. I'll sing You a love song, A love song to Jesus, I'll lift up my hands in Your name.


[Verse 3] 
For we are a symphony, A symphony of worship; We lift up our hands in Your name. For we are a symphony, A symphony of worship; We lift up our hands in Your name.


[Verse 4] 
We'll sing You a love song, A love song of worship, We'll lift up our hands in Your name. We'll sing You a love song, A love song to Jesus, We'll lift up our hands in Your name.
