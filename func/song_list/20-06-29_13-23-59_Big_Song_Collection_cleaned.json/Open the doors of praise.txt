[Verse 1] 
Open the doors of praise. Open the doors of praise. Open the doors of praise And let the Lord come in. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
In the spirit world There's a battle going on, And it rages endlessly. But in the name of the Lord, We can stand on His word, For in Him we have the victory.


[Verse 3] 
For He lives in the praises of His people, (echo) Here among us to empower us!


[Verse 4] 
Open the doors of praise. Open the doors of praise. Open the doors of praise And let the Lord come in. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
And the demons will flee, As He said it would be, And the skies will ring with shouts of praise. And the Lord Jesus Christ Will be lifted high, The Holy One who truly saves!


[Verse 6] 
For He lives in the praises of His people, (echo) Here among us to empower us! 


[Verse 7] 
Open the doors of praise. Open the doors of praise. Open the doors of praise And let the Lord come in. (Repeat)
