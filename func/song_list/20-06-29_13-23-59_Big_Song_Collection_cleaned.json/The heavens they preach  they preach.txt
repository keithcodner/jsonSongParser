[Verse 1] 
The heavens they preach, they preach, They preach the glorious splendour of God. The stars in the sky seem so out of reach, Yet they whisper His wonderful love. ||Day after day in a sermon of nature The works of His hands lift their voice: 'Wake up, you nations, and serve Your Creator, There's mercy in Him, so rejoice!'


[Verse 2] 
And I'll lift my heart and my hands to Him, And I'll let my life shine with love To God's wonderful Son. He wears the crown, He's the King. ||Come and behold Him now, Come and delight in His excellent virtues; Seek Him while He can be found, For He is the help and the hope For all the world.


[Verse 3] 
The prophets, they preached, they preached, They preached that one day a Saviour would come; And suddenly men heard a heavenly speech, The voice of God's only Son. ||Day after day in the streets and the temple He taught them and met their needs, And now through His death and His great resurrection His glorious purpose succeeds.


[Verse 4] 
And I'll lift my heart and my hands to Him, And I'll let my life shine with love To God's wonderful Son. He wears the crown, He's the King. ||Come and behold Him now, Come and delight in His excellent virtues; Seek Him while He can be found, For He is the help and the hope For all the world.


[Verse 5] 
Your people will preach, we'll preach, We'll preach the unfailing riches of Christ; There's no one who's fallen too far from His reach, Who can't come from death into life. ||Day after day at the dawn of revival The multitudes seek His face, As we work to speed on His final arrival And crown Him with glory and praise! 


[Verse 6] 
And I'll lift my heart and my hands to Him, And I'll let my life shine with love To God's wonderful Son. He wears the crown, He's the King. ||Come and behold Him now, Come and delight in His excellent virtues; Seek Him while He can be found, For He is the help and the hope For all the world.
