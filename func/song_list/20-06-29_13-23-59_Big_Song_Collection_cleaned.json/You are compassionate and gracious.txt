[Verse 1] 
You are compassionate and gracious, Patient and abounding in love; As far as the east is from the west You took the sins we were guilty of. And You deal tenderly with us, And You deal tenderly with us.


[Verse 2] 
And higher than the heavens, So great is Your love; Yes, higher than the heavens Is Your love for us.
