[Verse 1] 
Oh, it's great, great, brill, brill, Wicked, wicked, skill, skill, To have a friend like Jesus. Great, great, brill, brill, Wicked, wicked, skill, skill, To have a friend like Him. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
He's always there, He always listens, He always hears me When I talk to Him. He loves me now And will forever, I'll choose Him every day, day, day.
