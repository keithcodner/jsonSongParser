[Verse 1] 
This is my pilgrimage, To climb into You. This is my pilgrimage, To be absorbed by You.


[Verse 2] 
I'm so restless for more of You, O God. I'm so restless, hear these words, O God.


[Verse 3] 
Give me the eyes of a prophet, Help me to see the unseen, I long to hear the music of heaven, As the angels play in my ears. Sometimes I'm war torn and weary, Sometimes I'm willing and strong, But at this moment I'm standing before You As Your restless pilgrim.


[Verse 4] 
I'm so restless for more of You, O God. I'm so restless, hear these words, O God.


[Verse 5] 
I'll fix my eyes on You, I'll tread the path with You, I'll be a warrior of love for You. 


[Verse 6] 
I'm so restless for more of You, O God. I'm so restless, hear these words, O God.
