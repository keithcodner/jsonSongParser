[Verse 1] 
The father of lies, Coming to steal, kill, and destroy All my hopes Of being good enough.


[Verse 2] 
I hear him saying, "cursed are the ones who can’t abide." || He’s right.|| Alleluia. He’s right. 


[Verse 3] 
The devil Is preaching The song of the redeemed,|| That I am Cursed and gone astray, I cannot gain salvation.|| Embracing accusation.


[Verse 4] 
Could the father of lies Be telling the truth Of God to me tonight?|| If the penalty of sin is death, Then death is mine.


[Verse 5] 
I hear him saying, "cursed are the ones who can’t abide." || He’s right.|| Alleluia. He’s right. 


[Verse 6] 
The devil Is preaching The song of the redeemed,|| That I am Cursed and gone astray, I cannot gain salvation.|| Embracing accusation.


[Verse 7] 
Oh the devil’s singing over me An age old song,|| That I am cursed and gone astray.|| Singing the first verse so conveniently Over me,|| He’s forgotten the refrain...|| JESUS SAVES!
