[Verse 1] 
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us Through this world's tempestuous sea; Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us - You our only help and plea; Here possessing every blessing If our God our Father be.


[Verse 2] 
Saviour, by Your grace restore us, All our weaknesses are plain; You have lived on earth before us, You have felt our grief and pain: Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted, From the depths You rose again.


[Verse 3] 
Spirit of our God, descending, Fill our hearts with holy peace; Love with every passion blending, Pleasure that can never cease: Thus provided, pardoned, guided, Ever shall our joys increase.
