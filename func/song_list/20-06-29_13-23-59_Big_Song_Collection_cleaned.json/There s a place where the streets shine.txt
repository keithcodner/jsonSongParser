[Verse 1] 
There's a place where the streets shine With the glory of the Lamb. There's a way, we can go there, We can live there beyond time.


[Verse 2] 
There's a place where the streets shine With the glory of the Lamb. There's a way, we can go there, We can live there beyond time.


[Verse 3] 
No more pain, no more sadness, No more suffering, no more tears. No more sin, no more sickness, No injustice, no more death.


[Verse 4] 
There's a place where the streets shine With the glory of the Lamb. There's a way, we can go there, We can live there beyond time.


[Verse 5] 
No more pain, no more sadness, No more suffering, no more tears. No more sin, no more sickness, No injustice, no more death.


[Verse 6] 
There is joy everlasting, There is gladness, there is peace. There is wine ever flowing, There's a wedding, there's a feast. 


[Verse 7] 
There's a place where the streets shine With the glory of the Lamb. There's a way, we can go there, We can live there beyond time.


[Verse 8] 
No more pain, no more sadness, No more suffering, no more tears. No more sin, no more sickness, No injustice, no more death.


[Verse 9] 
Because of You, because of You, Because of Your love, Because of Your blood.


[Verse 10] 
All our sins are washed away, And we can live forever, Now we have this hope, Because of You. Oh, we'll see You face to face, And we will dance together In the city of our God, Because of You.
