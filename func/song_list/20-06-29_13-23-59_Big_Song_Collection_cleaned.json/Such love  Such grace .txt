[Verse 1] 
Such love! Such grace! Makes the pieces come falling into place, Breaks through the darkness, Turns on the light, Making blindness give way to sight. ||Your love has conquered, Has set us free To become all You've called us to be, Healing the wounded, making us stand, Bringing peace and a sword in our hand.


[Verse 2] 
And no power in the universe Can separate us from the love of God. We're Yours forever With nothing to fear, Willing slaves to the love that brought us here.
