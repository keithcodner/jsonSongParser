[Verse 1] 
Lord of the heavens, I bow my knee and worship You; I stand before You, And I am amazed. I see Your beauty Displayed in everything You do.


[Verse 2] 
For You are my Saviour, Lord and King, You are the only One for me; You are the only One that I adore. In Your Son atonement, sacrifice: Through His death redemption gives new life, And I reach out, receive Your endless love.
