[Verse 1] 
You have become for us wisdom; You have become for us righteousness. You have become our salvation; You have become all our holiness.


[Verse 2] 
All that we need is found in You; Oh, all that we need is in You. All that we need is found in You; You are our all in all. You have become our all in all.


[Verse 3] 
You have become our provision; In union with You we have victory. In You we have died and have risen; You are our great hope of glory. 


[Verse 4] 
All that we need is found in You; Oh, all that we need is in You. All that we need is found in You; You are our all in all. You have become our all in all.
