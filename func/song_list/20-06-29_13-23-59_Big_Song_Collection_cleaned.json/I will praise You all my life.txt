[Verse 1] 
I will praise You all my life; I will sing to You with my whole heart. I will trust in You, my hope and my help, My Maker and my faithful God.


[Verse 2] 
O faithful God, O faithful God, You lift me up and You uphold my cause; You give me life, You dry my eyes, You're always near, You're a faithful God.
