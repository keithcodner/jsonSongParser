[Verse 1] 
My friend and King, Love sweeter than a rose; You meet me where I am. What can I do But bow down on my knees? Your beauty blows my mind.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, I will call only to You, For You deserve the highest praise. And I will live only for You, For You deserve the highest praise.


[Verse 3] 
To be with You Is all that I desire; Lord, may You shine in me. You gave me life And sacrificed Your own; Who else would die for me?


[Verse 4] 
Lord, I will call only to You, For You deserve the highest praise. And I will live only for You, For You deserve the highest praise.
