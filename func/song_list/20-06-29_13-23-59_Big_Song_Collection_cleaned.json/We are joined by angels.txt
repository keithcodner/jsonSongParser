[Verse 1] 
We are joined by angels, Our purpose the same: To worship the one and only God, A little piece of heaven is in this place.


[Verse 2] 
And we cry together: Holy, holy For there is no other like You, Lord. We declare together: You are awesome, You are to be feared, honoured and revered, For You are the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
We are joined by angels, With one voice we sing, As we lift our hands to honour You, In worship, the angels extend their wings.


[Verse 4] 
And we cry together: Holy, holy For there is no other like You, Lord. We declare together: You are awesome, You are to be feared, honoured and revered, For You are the Lord.
