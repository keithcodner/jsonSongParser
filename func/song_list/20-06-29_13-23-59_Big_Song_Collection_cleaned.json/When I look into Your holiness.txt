[Verse 1] 
When I look into Your holiness, When I gaze into Your loveliness, When all things that surround Become shadows in the light of You;


[Verse 2] 
When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart, When my will becomes enthralled in Your love, When all things that surround Become shadows in the light of You:


[Verse 3] 
I worship You, I worship You, The reason I live is to worship You. I worship You, I worship You, The reason I live is to worship You.
