[Verse 1] 
There is one name under heaven By which men can be saved, Jesus alone. Only one name under heaven, Jesus, and Jesus alone.


[Verse 2] 
One sacrifice, One holy Lamb Shed His own blood, Paid for my sin; And this righteous One, God's only Son, I sing my praises to Him, I sing my praises to Him.
