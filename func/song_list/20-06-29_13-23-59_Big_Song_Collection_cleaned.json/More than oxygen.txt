[Verse 1] 
More than oxygen, I need Your love; More than life-giving food The hungry dream of. More than an eloquent word Depends on the tongue; More than a passionate song Needs to be sung.


[Verse 2] 
More than a word could ever say, More than a song could ever convey; I need You more than all of these things. Father, I need You more.


[Verse 3] 
More than magnet and steel Are drawn to unite; More that poets love words To rhyme as they write. More than comforting warmth Of sun in spring; More than the eagle loves wind Under its wings.


[Verse 4] 
More than a word could ever say, More than a song could ever convey; I need You more than all of these things. Father, I need You more.


[Verse 5] 
More than a blazing fire On a winter's night; More than tall evergreens Reach for the light. More than the pounding waves Long for the shore; More than these gifts You give, I love You more. 


[Verse 6] 
More than a word could ever say, More than a song could ever convey; I need You more than all of these things. Father, I need You more.
