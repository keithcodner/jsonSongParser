[Verse 1] 
Here we stand in total surrender, Lifting our voices, abandoned to Your cause. Here we stand, praying in the glory Of the one and only Jesus Christ, the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
This time revival! Lord, come and heal our land; Bring to completion The work that You've begun. This time revival! Stir up Your church again, Pour out Your Spirit On Your daughters and Your sons.


[Verse 3] 
Here we stand in need of Your mercy; Father, forgive us for the time that we have lost. Once again make us an army To conquer this nation with the message of the cross. 


[Verse 4] 
This time revival! Lord, come and heal our land; Bring to completion The work that You've begun. This time revival! Stir up Your church again, Pour out Your Spirit On Your daughters and Your sons.
