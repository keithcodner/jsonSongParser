[Verse 1] 
Yet will I praise Him, I will lift my hands to my Creator. Yet will I praise Him, My Saviour and my God. Yet will I praise Him, I will put my trust in my Provider. Yet will I praise Him, Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.


[Verse 2] 
Though the fig tree doesn't blossom And no ripened grapes appear, Though the harvest fails And fields provide no food; ||I'll be joyful in my Saviour, The Lord who is my strength; He will keep my ways And lead me in His truth.


[Verse 3] 
Yet will I praise Him, I will lift my hands to my Creator. Yet will I praise Him, My Saviour and my God. Yet will I praise Him, I will put my trust in my Provider. Yet will I praise Him, Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.


[Verse 4] 
When the night is overwhelming And the day is far from clear, When my heart is restless For the peace of God; ||Let Your song, Lord, through the ages, Through the prophets You have given, Lift my mind and heart To gaze upon You, Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Yet will I praise Him, I will lift my hands to my Creator. Yet will I praise Him, My Saviour and my God. Yet will I praise Him, I will put my trust in my Provider. Yet will I praise Him, Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.


[Verse 6] 
Be the strength, Lord, in my weakness, Let Your song be in my night; Be my rock when all around is sinking sand. Be the light, Lord, in my darkness, Be the vision of my eyes: In my passing days You are the great 'I Am'.


[Verse 7] 
When the night is overwhelming And the day is far from clear, When my heart is restless For the peace of God; ||Let Your song, Lord, through the ages, Through the prophets You have given, Lift my mind and heart To gaze upon You, Lord.


[Verse 8] 
Lord, I will praise You, I will lift my hands to my Creator. Lord, I will praise You, My Saviour and my God. Lord, I will praise You, I will put my trust in my Provider. Yes, I will praise You, Lord Jehovah, Sovereign God.
