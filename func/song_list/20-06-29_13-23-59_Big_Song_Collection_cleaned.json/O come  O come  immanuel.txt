[Verse 1] 
O come, O come, Immanuel, And ransom captive Israel, That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear.


[Verse 2] 
Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel.


[Verse 3] 
O come, O come, Thou Lord of might Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height In ancient times didst give the law In cloud, and majesty, and awe.


[Verse 4] 
Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel.


[Verse 5] 
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free Thine own from Satan's tyranny; From depths of hell Thy people save And give them victory o'er the grave.


[Verse 6] 
Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel.


[Verse 7] 
O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer Our spirits by Thine advent here; Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, And death's dark shadows put to flight.


[Verse 8] 
Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel.


[Verse 9] 
O come, Thou Key of David, come And open wide our heavenly home; Make safe the way that leads on high, And close the path to misery. 


[Verse 10] 
Rejoice, rejoice! Immanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel.
