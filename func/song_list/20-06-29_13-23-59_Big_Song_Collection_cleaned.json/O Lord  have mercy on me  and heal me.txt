[Verse 1] 
O Lord, have mercy on me, and heal me; O Lord, have mercy on me, and free me. Place my feet upon a rock, Put a new song in my heart, in my heart; O Lord, have mercy on me.


[Verse 2] 
O Lord, may Your love and Your grace protect me; O Lord, may Your ways and Your truth direct me. Place my feet upon a rock, Put a new song in my heart, in my heart; O Lord, have mercy on me.
