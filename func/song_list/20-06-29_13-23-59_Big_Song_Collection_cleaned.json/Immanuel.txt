[Verse 1] 
Immanuel, God is with us, Immanuel, He is here. Immanuel, He is among us, Immanuel, His kingdom is here.


[Verse 2] 
Wonderful Counsellor, they laughed at His wisdom, The Mighty God on a dusty road. Everlasting Father, a friend of sinners, The Prince of Peace in a cattle stall.


[Verse 3] 
Immanuel, God is with us, Immanuel, He is here. Immanuel, He is among us, Immanuel, His kingdom is here.


[Verse 4] 
He was despised and rejected, A man of sorrows acquainted with grief. From Him we turned and hid our faces; He was despised, Him we did not esteem.


[Verse 5] 
Immanuel, God is with us, Immanuel, He is here. Immanuel, He is among us, Immanuel, His kingdom is here.


[Verse 6] 
But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities. On Him was the punishment that made us whole, And by His stripes we are healed.


[Verse 7] 
Immanuel, God is with us, Immanuel, He is here. Immanuel, He is among us, Immanuel, His kingdom is here.


[Verse 8] 
He was oppressed, He was afflicted, And yet He opened not His mouth. Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, Like a sheep before his shearers He did not speak.
