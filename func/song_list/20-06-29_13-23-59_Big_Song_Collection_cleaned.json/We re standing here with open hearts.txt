[Verse 1] 
We're standing here with open hearts, Our voices joined in unity. We know we don't lead perfect lives, And we cry to You for mercy. ||Father in heaven, we honour Your name, That we might bring You glory and fame; Pour out Your Spirit upon us we pray, To heal and deliver and save.


[Verse 2] 
This is our heart cry; This is our heart cry. This is our heart cry; This is our heart cry.


[Verse 3] 
We stand before the throne of grace, A people for Your possession; We hunger and thirst, we seek Your face, Come touch us with Your presence. ||Father in heaven, holy and true, Stretch out Your hand, let power break through; Pour out Your Spirit upon us today, To heal and deliver and save. 


[Verse 4] 
This is our heart cry; This is our heart cry. This is our heart cry; This is our heart cry.
