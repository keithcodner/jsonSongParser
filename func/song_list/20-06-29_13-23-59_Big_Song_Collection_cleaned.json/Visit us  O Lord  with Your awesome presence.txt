[Verse 1] 
Visit us, O Lord, with Your awesome presence. Dwell in our midst in Your glory and power, In Your strength and in Your love.


[Verse 2] 
This is our cry, O Lord, Let Your presence fill this place, Fill this place. This is our cry, O Lord, Let Your presence fill this place, Fill this place.
