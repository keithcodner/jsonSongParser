[Verse 1] 
GO GO GO 


[Verse 2] 
Your love has started something deep in me My shame obliterated Now this hope is rising, worlds colliding 


[Verse 3] 
Heaven is the place I want to be I know I don't deserve it But the way is open, God has spoken


[Verse 4] 
There is a place that I know I will GO GO GO - GO GO GO 


[Verse 5] 
'Cause heaven's calling out to me It's the hope I have as a soul set free Living like I am already there Full of love, joy, peace, come on Are you ready?


[Verse 6] 
GO GO GO 


[Verse 7] 
Heaven is ablaze inside of me The treasure shining brightly In this jar of clay, I'll light the way


[Verse 8] 
GO GO GO
