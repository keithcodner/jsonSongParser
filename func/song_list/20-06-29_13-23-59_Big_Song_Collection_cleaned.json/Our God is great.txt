[Verse 1] 
Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great.


[Verse 2] 
He gave us the wind, The sun and the snow, The sand on the sea shore, The flowers that grow. Morning and evening, Winter and spring; Come join all creation and sing.


[Verse 3] 
Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great.


[Verse 4] 
The gifts that He brings Are new every day, From glorious sunset To soft falling rain. The mist on the hills, The light and the shade; Come join all creation in praise.


[Verse 5] 
Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great.


[Verse 6] 
For music and dancing, The sounds that we hear; For colours and words, The life that we share, we say: 


[Verse 7] 
Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great. Our God is great.
