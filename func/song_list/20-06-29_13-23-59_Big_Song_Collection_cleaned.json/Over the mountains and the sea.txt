[Verse 1] 
Over the mountains and the sea Your river runs with love for me, And I will open up my heart, And let the Healer set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth, And I will daily lift my hands, For I will always sing of When Your love came down, yeah.


[Verse 2] 
I could sing of Your love forever, I could sing of Your love forever. I could sing of Your love forever, I could sing of Your love forever.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, I feel like dancing, It's foolishness I know; But when the world has seen the light, They will dance with joy Like we're dancing now. 


[Verse 4] 
I could sing of Your love forever, I could sing of Your love forever. I could sing of Your love forever, I could sing of Your love forever.
