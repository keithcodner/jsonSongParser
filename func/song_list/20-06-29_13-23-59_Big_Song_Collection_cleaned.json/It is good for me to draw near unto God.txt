[Verse 1] 
It is good for me to draw near unto God; Lord, I put my trust in Thee, That I may declare all Thy works, O my God, Lord, I put my trust in Thee.


[Verse 2] 
My flesh and my heart they fail me, But God is the strength of my life; You are my portion both now and ever more, There is none that I desire but Thee.
