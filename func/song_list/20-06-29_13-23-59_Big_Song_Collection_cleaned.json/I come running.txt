[Verse 1] 
I come running to You, Father, Trying to find a secret place with You. My soul crying out, just to hear Your voice, Oh, I must have You. 


[Verse 2] 
I come running to You, Jesus, I'm so hungry for Your truth. I've found many treasures Hidden in Your word, But I must have You. 


[Verse 3] 
Only You, Lord, will I worship, Only You will I serve. And my hope lies in You, Lord, Only You can make me whole. And I will say 'I love You.' Yes, I will sing to You, to You.


[Verse 4] 
I come longing for You, Spirit, So dry I need to know Your touch. I know living waters deep within me, But I must have more of You.


[Verse 5] 
Only You, Lord, will I worship, Only You will I serve. And my hope lies in You, Lord, Only You can make me whole. And I will say 'I love You.' Yes, I will sing to You, to You.
