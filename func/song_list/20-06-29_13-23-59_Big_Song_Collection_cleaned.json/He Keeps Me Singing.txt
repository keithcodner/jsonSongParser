[Verse 1] 
[E]There’s within my heart a [A]melo[F#7]dy [B]Jesus whispers sweet and [E/B]low:[B7] [E]"Fear not I am with thee. [A]Peace be [F#7]still." [B]In all of life’s [E/B]ebb [B7]and [E]flow.


[Verse 2] 
[E]All my life was wrecked by [A]sin and [F#7]strife; [B]Discord filled my heart with [E/B]pain.[B7] [E]Jesus swept across the [A]broken [F#7]strings; [B]Stirred the slumb’ring [E/B]chords [B7]a[E]gain.


[Verse 3] 
[E]Feasting in the riches [A]of His [F#7]grace; [B]Resting neath His shelt’ring [E/B]wing.[B7] [E]Always looking on His [A]smiling [F#7]face: [B]That is why I [E/B]shout [B7]and [E]sing.


[Verse 4] 
[E]Though sometimes He leads through [A]waters [F#7]deep, [B]Trials fall across the [E/B]way;[B7] [E]Though sometimes the path seems [A]rough and [F#7]steep; [B]I see His footprints [E/B]all [B7]the [E]way.


[Verse 5] 
[E]Soon He’s coming back to [A]welcome [F#7]me [B]Far beyond the starry [E/B]sky.[B7] [E]I shall wing my flight to [A]worlds un[F#7]known; [B]I shall reign with [E/B]Him [B7]on [E]high.


[Verse 6] 
[E]Jesus, Jesus, [B]Jesus; Sweetest name [B/E]I [E]know. Fills my every [A6]longing; [B]Keeps me singing [E/B]as [B7]I [E]go.
