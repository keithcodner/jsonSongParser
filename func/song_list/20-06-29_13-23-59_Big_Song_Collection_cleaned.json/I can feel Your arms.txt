[Verse 1] 
I can feel Your arms surrounding, Treasuring my soul. Draw me ever closer into Your love, Into Your love. ||Lead me to Your place of wonder, Shower me with grace. Holy God, forgive my unrighteous ways, Unrighteous ways.


[Verse 2] 
Oh I love You, Lord, All I am is Yours, As Your mercy pours into my heart. You're my faithful King, Over everything, Hear my spirit sing that Jesus is Lord.
