[Verse 1] 
There's a people God has chosen from the nations, He has ransomed from the prisons For His joy, for His delight. He has known them From before He made the heavens, And His love has spanned the ages, How He longs to bring them home!


[Verse 2] 
Oh, that we might see Your glory, Lord.(Men) Oh, that we might see Your face.(Women) Oh, that we might be with You forever.(Men) Oh, that we might be with You.(Women) ||Knowing You as You have known us,(All) Faith eclipsed by what we see: One with You for all eternity!


[Verse 3] 
We're that people You have rescued from our blindness, You have come to live within us, To share Your peace, to share Your joy. Come and fill us, Flood our spirits with Your fullness, Let us taste the wine of heaven, Only You can satisfy.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, that we might see Your glory, Lord.(Men) Oh, that we might see Your face.(Women) Oh, that we might be with You forever.(Men) Oh, that we might be with You.(Women) ||Knowing You as You have known us,(All) Faith eclipsed by what we see: One with You for all eternity!
