[Verse 1] 
Oh Lord my [A2]God, when I in [D]awesome wonder Consider [A2]all the [E]worlds Thy [Bm]hands have [A2]made; I see the stars, I hear the [D]rolling thunder: Thy pow'r through[A2]out the [E]uni[Bm]verse dis[A2]played.


[Verse 2] 
Then sings my [A2]soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee, How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A2]art; Then sings my soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee, How great Thou [E]art[Bm], how great Thou [A2]art.


[Verse 3] 
When through the [A2]woods, and forest [D]glades I wander, And hear the [A2]birds sing [E]sweetly [Bm]in the [A2]trees; When I look down from lofty [D]mountain grandeur, And hear the b[A2]rook and [E]feel the [Bm]gentle [A2]breeze.


[Verse 4] 
And when I [A2]think that God, His [D]Son not sparing Sent Him to [A2]die, I [E]scarce can [Bm]take it [A2]in; That on the cross, my burden [D]gladly bearing, He bled and d[A2]ied to [E]take a[Bm]way my [A2]sin.


[Verse 5] 
When Christ shall [A2]come with shout of [D]acclamation And take me [A2]home, what [E]joy shall [Bm]fill my [A2]heart; Then I shall bow in humble [D]adoration, And there proc[A2]laim my [E]God how [Bm]great Thou [A2]art!
