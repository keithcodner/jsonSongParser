[Verse 1] 
Your love, shining like the sun, Pouring like the rain, Raging like the storm, Refreshing me again. I receive Your love. 


[Verse 2] 
Your grace frees me from the past, It purges every sin, It purifies my heart And heals me from within. I receive Your grace.


[Verse 3] 
Pour over me, Pour over me, Let Your rain flood this thirsty soul. Pour over me Your waves of love, Pour over me. 


[Verse 4] 
I come and lay my burden down Gladly at Your feet, I'm opening up my heart; Come make this joy complete. I receive Your peace.


[Verse 5] 
Pour over me, Pour over me, Let Your rain flood this thirsty soul. Pour over me Your waves of love, Pour over me.
