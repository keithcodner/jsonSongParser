[Verse 1] 
As for me and my house, As for me and my family, As for me and my children, We will serve the Lord. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
In this family, We're gonna do things properly, Read God's word every day And then we'll try to pray; Although we get it wrong, We will still carry on, Make Jesus number one in this place. In this place we're gonna say grace.
