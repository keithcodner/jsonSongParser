[Verse 1] 
I believe in God the Father, I believe in Jesus the Son: I believe in God the Holy Spirit, I believe in the Three in One.


[Verse 2] 
I believe He was born of a virgin, Was crucified and buried in the ground. Descended into hell and won the battle, But the devil, death and hell Couldn't hold Him down.


[Verse 3] 
I believe in God the Father, I believe in Jesus the Son: I believe in God the Holy Spirit, I believe in the Three in One.


[Verse 4] 
O Lord, we're drowning in confusion, So many of us going separate ways; Wanting to be God is our delusion, But some of us are standing up, Not ashamed to say, I believe, I believe!


[Verse 5] 
I believe in God the Father, I believe in Jesus the Son: I believe in God the Holy Spirit, I believe in the Three in One.


[Verse 6] 
I believe He ascended into heaven, Where He sits at God's right hand; And I believe our King will be returning To judge the living and the dead, From every tribe and land. 


[Verse 7] 
I believe in God the Father, I believe in Jesus the Son: I believe in God the Holy Spirit, I believe in the Three in One.
