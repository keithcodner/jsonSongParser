[Verse 1] 
Heaven opened and You came to save me. You were broken and became sin for me. No death, no hate, no shame, No slave again to fear; New life, new hope, new love, Your kingdom's coming near.


[Verse 2] 
And I give You praise And I lift my hands to You, All of my days I will bring my love to You. I will give my life as an offering, As a sacrifice to the coming King of grace, Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
You have risen from the grave forever. Through eternity I'll praise my Saviour. No death, no hate, no shame, No slave again to fear; New life, new hope, new love, Your kingdom's coming near.


[Verse 4] 
And I give You praise And I lift my hands to You, All of my days I will bring my love to You. I will give my life as an offering, As a sacrifice to the coming King of grace, Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
I love and adore You, And live for Your praise. In truth and in spirit I long for You, my King.


[Verse 6] 
And I give You praise And I lift my hands to You, All of my days I will bring my love to You. I will give my life as an offering, As a sacrifice to the coming King of grace, Jesus.
