[Verse 1] 
You make Your face to shine on me, And that my soul knows very well; You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free, And that my soul knows very well.


[Verse 2] 
When mountains fall I'll stand By the power of Your hand, And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell, And that my soul knows very well. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Joy and strength each day I'll find, And that my soul knows very well; Forgiveness, hope I know is mine, And that my soul knows very well. 


[Verse 4] 
When mountains fall I'll stand By the power of Your hand, And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell, And that my soul knows very well. (Repeat)
