[Verse 1] 
We are called to be prophets to this nation, To be the word of God in every situation; Change my heart, change my heart today. ||Who'll be the salt if the salt should lose its flavour? Who'll be the salt if the salt should lose its flavour? Change my heart, change my heart today. 


[Verse 2] 
Lord, loose the chains of oppression; Lord, set the captives free. Lord, fill my heart with compassion: Shine Your light, shine Your light, Shine Your light through me. 


[Verse 3] 
Work a miracle in my heart, Work a miracle in my heart, Work a miracle in my heart, O Lord, today. 


[Verse 4] 
Lord, take all of my lies and take all of my greed; Let me be a sacrifice for those who are in need. Change my heart, change my heart today. ||Lord, without Your power it's all just good intentions; Lord, without Your grace who could find redemption? Change my heart, change my heart today.


[Verse 5] 
Work a miracle in my heart, Work a miracle in my heart, Work a miracle in my heart, O Lord, today.
