[Verse 1] 
Father in [Am]Heaven[G],[C] Lord may Your [Am]name be [G]glori[C]fied Above all [Am]others,[G] above all this [C]world, Above every[Am]thing else [G]in our [C]lives.|| For [Dm]nothing else in all of this world [Am]matters But to [C]live our lives for You and You a[B7]lone.


[Verse 2] 
Beautiful [Am]Savior[G],[C] Truly we [Am]praise Your [G]Love for [C]us. While we as [Am]sinners[G] in all our [C]weakness And still You [Am]gave Your [G]life on the [C]cross.|| You [Dm]saved us, Lord, from all of our trans[Am]gressions And de[C]livered us into Your loving a[B7]rms.


[Verse 3] 
May Your [Am]wonders never cease, May Your [F]Spirit never leave, May we [C]ever long to see Your [G]face; And when we [Am]turn from You again Oh how [F]quickly we forget, May we [C]be reminded of Your [B7]grace: May Your wonders never [Am]cease.[G][C]
