[Verse 1] 
He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns, He reigns enthroned in majesty. Shout your praise, His banners raise, For Jesus reigns. Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.


[Verse 2] 
Our highest praise we bring To our great eternal King. His glory fills the skies, Now from earth let praise arise.


[Verse 3] 
He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns, He reigns enthroned in majesty. Shout your praise, His banners raise, For Jesus reigns. Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.


[Verse 4] 
He spoiled the hosts of hell, And like blazing stars, they fell. He led them forth in chains - Now our mighty Victor reigns! 


[Verse 5] 
He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns, He reigns enthroned in majesty. Shout your praise, His banners raise, For Jesus reigns. Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.
