[Verse 1] 
Hope of the world, You stepped into our time, And yet they spurned You and then turned away. To a dying world You reached out, But they didn't want to hear The words You had to say.


[Verse 2] 
Hope of the world, You stepped into our time, And yet they spurned You and then turned away. To a dying world You reached out, But they didn't want to hear The words You had to say.


[Verse 3] 
Mercy, love, truth, You shared all these And then to bring them life Became a dying seed. Now to all who will receive A new way has been opened, And Your children are the light they need.


[Verse 4] 
Mercy, love, truth, You shared all these And then to bring them life Became a dying seed. Now to all who will receive A new way has been opened, And Your children are the light they need.


[Verse 5] 
But may the light You came to bring now shine In a world that finally lost its way. Holy love, now come, Come flow though me, Be my theme until my dying day.


[Verse 6] 
And may the light You came to bring now shine In a world that finally lost its way. Holy love, now come, Come flow though me, Be my theme until my dying day.
