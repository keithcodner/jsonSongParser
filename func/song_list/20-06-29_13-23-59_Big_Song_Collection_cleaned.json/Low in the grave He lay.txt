[Verse 1] 
Low in the grave He lay, Jesus, my Saviour, Waiting the coming day, Jesus, my Lord:


[Verse 2] 
Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty triumph o'er His foes; He arose a Victor from the dark domain, And He lives for ever with His saints to reign: He arose! He arose! Alleluia! Christ arose!


[Verse 3] 
Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus, my Saviour; Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus, my Lord:


[Verse 4] 
Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty triumph o'er His foes; He arose a Victor from the dark domain, And He lives for ever with His saints to reign: He arose! He arose! Alleluia! Christ arose!


[Verse 5] 
Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus, my Saviour; He tore the bars away, Jesus, my Lord: 


[Verse 6] 
Up from the grave He arose, With a mighty triumph o'er His foes; He arose a Victor from the dark domain, And He lives for ever with His saints to reign: He arose! He arose! Alleluia! Christ arose!
