[Verse 1] 
You're the Lion of Judah, The Lamb that was slain, You ascended to heaven And ever more will reign; At the end of the age When the earth You reclaim, You will gather the nations before You. ||And the eyes of all men will be Fixed on the Lamb who was crucified, For with wisdom and mercy and justice You'll reign at Your Father's side.


[Verse 2] 
And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.' And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign As the King of all kings And the Lord of all Lords.'


[Verse 3] 
There's a shield in our hand And a sword at our side, There's a fire in our spirit That cannot be denied; As the Father has told us, For these You have died, For the nations that gather before You. ||And the ears of all men need to hear Of the Lamb who was crucified, Who descended to hell yet was raised up To reign at the Father's side. 


[Verse 4] 
And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.' And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign As the King of all kings And the Lord of all Lords.'
