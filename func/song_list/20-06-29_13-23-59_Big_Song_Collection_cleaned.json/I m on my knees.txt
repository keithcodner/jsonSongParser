[Verse 1] 
I'm on my knees at the cross, Where Your blood was sacrificed; So amazed that there is grace Enough for me. I don't deserve the love You bring, But I'm at that place again, Where I need You To forgive my foolish heart.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, what mercy, Oh, what mercy, Oh, what mercy Is mine to receive.
