[Verse 1] 
This is my desire, to honour You: Lord, with all my heart I worship You. All I have within me, I give You praise: All that I adore is in You.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, I give You my heart, I give You my soul; I live for You alone. Every breath that I take, Every moment I'm awake, Lord, have Your way in me.
