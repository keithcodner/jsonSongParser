[Verse 1] 
Overwhelmed by love, Deeper than oceans, High as the heavens. Ever living God Your love has rescued me.


[Verse 2] 
All my sin was laid On Your dear Son, Your precious One. All my debt He paid, Great is Your love for me.


[Verse 3] 
No-one could ever earn Your love, Your grace and mercy is free. Lord, these words are true, So is my love for You.
