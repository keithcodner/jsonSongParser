[Verse 1] 
We'll walk the land With hearts on fire, And every step Will be a prayer. Hope is rising, New day dawning, Sound of singing Fills the air.


[Verse 2] 
Two thousand years, And still the flame Is burning bright Across the land. Hearts are waiting, Longing, aching, For awakening Once again.


[Verse 3] 
Let the flame burn brighter In the heart of the darkness, Turning night to glorious day. Let the song grow louder As our love grows stronger, Let it shine, let it shine.


[Verse 4] 
We'll walk for truth, Speak out for love; In Jesus' name We shall be strong, To lift the fallen, To save the children, To fill the nation With Your song. 


[Verse 5] 
Let the flame burn brighter In the heart of the darkness, Turning night to glorious day. Let the song grow louder As our love grows stronger, Let it shine, let it shine.
