[Verse 1] 
I'm gonna trust in God, I'm gonna trust in Jesus Without shame and without fear. I'm gonna fix my eyes On the hope of glory, For His day is drawing near. 


[Verse 2] 
How great is the love of God, How steady is His hand To guide me through this world. And though I am weak, in Him I stand, And you will hear me say today, In faith, I'm gonna trust in God.


[Verse 3] 
Now when the cares of life Seem overwhelming, And my heart is sinking down, I'm gonna lift my hands To the One who'll help me, To the One who holds my crown.


[Verse 4] 
How great is the love of God, How steady is His hand To guide me through this world. And though I am weak, in Him I stand, And you will hear me say today, In faith, I'm gonna trust in God.
