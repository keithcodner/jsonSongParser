[Verse 1] 
[G]I'm pressing on the [D/A]upward [C]way, New heights I'm [G]gaining [G/B]every [D]day; Still praying [G]as I'm [D/A]onward [C]bound, "Lord plant my [G/D]feet on high[D]er [G]ground."


[Verse 2] 
[G]My heart has no de[D/A]sire to [C]stay Where doubts a[G]rise and [G/B]fears dis[D]may; Tho' some may [G]dwell where [D/A]these a[C]bound, My prayer, my [G/D]aim, is high[D]er [G]ground.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, lift me [G]up and let me [D]stand By faith on heaven's table-[G]land; A higher plane than I have [C]found-- Lord, plant my [G/D]feet on high[D]er [G]ground.


[Verse 4] 
[G]I want to live a[D/A]bove the [C]world, Tho' Satan's [G]darts at [G/B]me are [D]hurled; For faith has [G]caught the [D/A]joyful [C]sound, The song of [G/D]saints on high[D]er [G]ground.


[Verse 5] 
Lord, lift me [G]up and let me [D]stand By faith on heaven's table-[G]land; A higher plane than I have [C]found-- Lord, plant my [G/D]feet on high[D]er [G]ground.


[Verse 6] 
[G]I want to scale the [D/A]utmost [C]height And catch a [G]gleam of [G/B]glory [D]bright; But still I'll [G]pray 'till [D/A]heav'n I've [C]found, "Lord lead me [G/D]on to high[D]er [G]ground."


[Verse 7] 
Lord, lift me [G]up and let me [D]stand By faith on heaven's table-[G]land; A higher plane than I have [C]found-- Lord, plant my [G/D]feet on high[D]er [G]ground.
