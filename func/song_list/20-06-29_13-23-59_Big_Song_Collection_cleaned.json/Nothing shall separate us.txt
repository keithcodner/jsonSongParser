[Verse 1] 
Nothing shall separate us From the love of God. Nothing shall separate us From the love of God.


[Verse 2] 
God did not spare His only Son, Gave Him to save us all. Sin's price was met by Jesus' death And heaven's mercy falls.


[Verse 3] 
Nothing shall separate us From the love of God. Nothing shall separate us From the love of God.


[Verse 4] 
Up from the grave Jesus was raised To sit at God's right hand; Pleading our cause in heaven's courts, Forgiven we can stand.


[Verse 5] 
Nothing shall separate us From the love of God. Nothing shall separate us From the love of God.


[Verse 6] 
Now by God's grace we have embraced A life set free from sin; We shall deny all that destroys Our union with Him. 


[Verse 7] 
Nothing shall separate us From the love of God. Nothing shall separate us From the love of God.
