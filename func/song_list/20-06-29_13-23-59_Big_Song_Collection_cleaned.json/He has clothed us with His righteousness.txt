[Verse 1] 
He has clothed us with His righteousness, Covered us with His great love. He has showered us with mercy, And we delight to know the glorious favour, Wondrous favour of God.


[Verse 2] 
We rejoice in the grace of God Poured upon our lives. Loving kindness has come to us Because of Jesus Christ. We rejoice in the grace of God, Our hearts overflow. What a joy to know the grace of God!


[Verse 3] 
He's brought us into His family, Made us heirs with His own Son. All good things He freely gives us, And we cannot conceive what God's preparing God's preparing for us. 


[Verse 4] 
We rejoice in the grace of God Poured upon our lives. Loving kindness has come to us Because of Jesus Christ. We rejoice in the grace of God, Our hearts overflow. What a joy to know the grace of God!
