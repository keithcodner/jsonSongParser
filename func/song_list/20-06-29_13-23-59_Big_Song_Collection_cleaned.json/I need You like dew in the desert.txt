[Verse 1] 
I need You like dew in the desert, Like refreshing summer rain, Come and pour Your love again on me. I'm finding that every time I come And ask for something more, You never fail to pour Your love on me.


[Verse 2] 
And peace like a river flows, Waves of mercy ever roll; Take me deeper, I want to know You more. Pour Your love, pour Your love, Pour Your love on me.
