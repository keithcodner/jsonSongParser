[Verse 1] 
My heart is captivated, Lord, by You alone; Captured by the awesomeness of You alone. Melted by the grace and mercy You have shown, I stand in wonder. ||I reach to You, The One who makes the blind eyes see, Who breaks the chains of sickness with authority. Restoring what was broken, So it may fly again.


[Verse 2] 
I live to worship You; I breathe to worship You. All of my days Your face I will seek. For as I worship You, You lead me to that place, To that place of divine exchange.
