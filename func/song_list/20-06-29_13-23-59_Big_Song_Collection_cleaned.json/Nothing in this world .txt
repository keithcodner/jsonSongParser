[Verse 1] 
Nothing in this world, No treasure man could buy, Could take the place of drawing near to You. There's nothing I want more Than to spend my days with You, Dwelling in Your secret place of praise.


[Verse 2] 
And oh, how I need You. Jesus, I need You. You are the One that satisfies, You are the One that satisfies.


[Verse 3] 
So place within my heart A fire that burns for You, That waters cannot quench Nor wash away. And let that fire blaze Through all eternity, Where one day I shall see You face to face.


[Verse 4] 
And oh, how I need You. Jesus, I need You. You are the One that satisfies, You are the One that satisfies.
