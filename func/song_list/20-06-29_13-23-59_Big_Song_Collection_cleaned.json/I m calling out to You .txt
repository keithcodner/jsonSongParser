[Verse 1] 
I'm calling out to You, There must be something more, Some deeper place to find, Some secret place to hide Where I have not gone before. ||Where my soul is satisfied, And my sin is put to death, And I can hear Your voice, Your purpose is my choice, As natural as a breath.


[Verse 2] 
The love I knew before, When You first touched my life, I need You to restore, I want You to revive.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, place in my heart a passion for Jesus, A hunger that seizes my passion for You. My one desire, my greatest possession, My only confession, my passion for You.
