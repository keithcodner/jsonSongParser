[Verse 1] 
You are [A]beautiful beyond des[E]cription, Too [D2/A]marvelous for [A]words, Too [A]wonderful for compre[F#m]hension, Like [D]nothing ever seen or [E]heard.|| Who can [F#m]grasp Your infinite [A]wisdom? Who can [D]fathom the depths of Your [E]love? You are [A]beautiful beyond des[E]cription, Majes[D]ty en[E]throned a[A]bove.


[Verse 2] 
[E]And I [A]stand, I [E/A]stand, in [D]awe of You; I [A]stand, I [E/A]stand in [D]awe of You; Holy [C#sus]God, to whom all [Dmaj7]praise is due, I [Bm7]stand in [E]awe of [D/A]You.[A]


[Verse 3] 
You are [A]beautiful beyond des[E]cription Yet God [D2/A]crushed You for my [A]sin In [A]agony and deep af[F#m]fliction Cut [D]off that I might enter [E]in.|| Who can [F#m]grasp such tender com[A]passion? Who can [D2/A]fathom this mercy so [E]free? You are [A]beautiful beyond des[E]cription, Lamb of [D]God who [E]died for [A]me.


[Verse 4] 
[E]And I [A]stand, I [E/A]stand, in [D]awe of You; I [A]stand, I [E/A]stand in [D]awe of You; Holy [C#sus]God, to whom all [Dmaj7]praise is due, I [Bm7]stand in [E]awe of [D/A]You.[A]
