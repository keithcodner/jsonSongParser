[Verse 1] 
I just want to love, I just want to sing To the One above Who has touched this thirsty soul. (Repeat) And now I'll never be the same.


[Verse 2] 
I'll always love You, I'll always sing to You, Jesus. I long to worship You in spirit and in truth. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Every day I'll come, Spend my life with You, Learning of Your heart, And what You're calling me to do. (Repeat) My every breath belongs to You.


[Verse 4] 
I'll always love You, I'll always sing to You, Jesus. I long to worship You in spirit and in truth. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
And with this song We'll lift the name of Jesus higher. And with a shout We'll raise up one voice.


[Verse 6] 
I'll always love You, I'll always sing to You, Jesus. I long to worship You in spirit and in truth. (Repeat)
