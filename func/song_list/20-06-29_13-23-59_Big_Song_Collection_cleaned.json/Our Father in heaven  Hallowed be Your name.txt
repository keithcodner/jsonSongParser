[Verse 1] 
Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as in heaven. ||Give us today our daily bread, And forgive us our sins As we forgive those who sin against us, And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil;


[Verse 2] 
For the kingdom, the power, And the glory are Yours, Now and forever, Amen.


[Verse 3] 
For the kingdom, the power And the glory are Yours, Now and forever, Now and forever, Now and forever, Amen.
