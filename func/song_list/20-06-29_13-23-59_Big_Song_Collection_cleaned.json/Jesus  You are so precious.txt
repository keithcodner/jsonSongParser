[Verse 1] 
Jesus, You are so precious to me; To behold You is all I desire. Seated in glory, now and forever, My Jesus, my Saviour, my Lord. 


[Verse 2] 
I worship You, I worship You, Lord, I worship You, Yes, I worship You.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, You are so precious to me; Your beauty has captured my gaze. Now I will come and bow down before You, And pour sweet perfume on Your feet.


[Verse 4] 
I worship You, I worship You, Lord, I worship You, Yes, I worship You.
