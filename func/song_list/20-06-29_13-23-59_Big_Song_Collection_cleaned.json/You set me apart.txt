[Verse 1] 
You set me apart, Gave me a new heart, Filled with compassion To share Your great love. Show me Your ways, I want to know You. Guide me in truth, My hope is in You.


[Verse 2] 
That I may dwell in Your house forever, Lifting up Your name; Dwell in Your house forevermore. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
I'll hold on to You, My strength and my refuge. Whom shall I fear? I know You are near. All of my days I live for You, Lord. Establish my path, There's one thing I ask.


[Verse 4] 
That I may dwell in Your house forever, Lifting up Your name; Dwell in Your house forevermore. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
Holy Spirit, have Your way. Sweet anointing, teach our hearts, Our lives, we pray.


[Verse 6] 
That I may dwell in Your house forever, Lifting up Your name; Dwell in Your house forevermore. (Repeat)
