[Verse 1] 
There is a higher throne Than all this world has known, Where faithful ones from every tongue Will one day come. Before the Son we'll stand, Made faultless through the Lamb; Believing hearts find promised grace: Salvation comes.


[Verse 2] 
Hear heaven's voices sing, Their thunderous anthem rings Through emerald courts and sapphire skies, Their praises rise. All glory, wisdom, power, Strength, thanks and honour are To God, our King who reigns on high Forever more.


[Verse 3] 
And there we'll find our home, Our life before the throne; We'll honour Him in perfect song Where we belong. He'll wipe each tear-stained eye, As thirst and hunger die; The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King: We'll reign with Him.


[Verse 4] 
Hear heaven's voices sing, Their thunderous anthem rings Through emerald courts and sapphire skies, Their praises rise. All glory, wisdom, power, Strength, thanks and honour are To God, our King who reigns on high Forever more.
