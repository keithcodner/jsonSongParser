[Verse 1] 
I'm learning to love You, To love and to trust You. I'm learning to give You all that I am. I'm learning to cling to the words You have spoken. I'm learning to let go my life in Your hands.


[Verse 2] 
For You are faithful in all of Your ways, In wisdom unsearchable, and full of grace. Oh, You are beautiful beyond words. I'm learning to love You.


[Verse 3] 
So teach me to love You, To love and to trust You, And teach me to give You all that I am. And teach me to cling to the words You have spoken, Teach me to let go my life in Your hands.


[Verse 4] 
We are like shadows that change with the day; And like the flowers our beauty will fade. But Yours is the kingdom and the power; Forever and ever Your glory will always remain.
