[Verse 1] 
Who [D]is this King of Glory[A] that pur[G]sues me with His love, And [D]haunts me with each hearing[A] of His [G]softly spoken words? My [G]conscience a reminder of for[Bm]giveness that I need, Who [A]is this King of Glory,[G] who offers it to [D]me.


[Verse 2] 
Who [D]is this King of angels[A], oh [G]blessed Prince of Peace, Re[D]vealing things of heaven[A] and [G]all it's mysteries? My [G]spirit's ever longing for His [Bm]grace in which to stand, Who [A]is this King of Glory?[G] Son of God and Son of [D]man.


[Verse 3] 
His name is [G]Jesus, precious [Bm]Jesus; Lord Al[A]mighty, King of [G]my heart, King of [D]Glory.


[Verse 4] 
Who [D]is this King of Glory[A] with [G]strength and majesty, And [D]wisdom beyond measure,[A] oh [G]gracious King of Kings? The [G]Lord of earth and heaven, the [Bm]Creator of all things, He [A]is the King of Glory,[G] He's everything to [D]me.
