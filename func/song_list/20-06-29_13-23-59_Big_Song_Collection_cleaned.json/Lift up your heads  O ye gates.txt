[Verse 1] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; And the King of glory shall come in, The King of glory shall come in, The King of glory shall come in.


[Verse 2] 
(Women) Who is the King of glory? What is His name? (Men) The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord, mighty in battle, strong to save.


[Verse 3] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; And the King of glory shall come in, The King of glory shall come in, The King of glory shall come in.


[Verse 4] 
(Women) Who shall ascend the hill, The hill of the Lord? (Men) Even he that hath clean hands And a pure heart with which to praise his God. 


[Verse 5] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; And the King of glory shall come in, The King of glory shall come in, The King of glory shall come in.
