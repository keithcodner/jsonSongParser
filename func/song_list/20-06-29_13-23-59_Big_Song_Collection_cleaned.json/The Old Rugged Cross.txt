[Verse 1] 
On a [A]hill far away stood an [D]old rugged cross, The [E7]emblem of suff'ring and [A]shame; And I [A]love that old cross where the [D]dearest and best, For a [E7]world of lost sinners was [A]slain.


[Verse 2] 
So I'll [E7]cherish the old rugged [A]cross, Till my [D]trophies at last I lay [A]down; I will [A]cling to the old rugged [D]cross, And ex[A]change it some [E7]day for a [A]crown.


[Verse 3] 
Oh that [A]old rugged cross, so de[D]spised by the world, Has a [E7]wondrous attraction for [A]me; For the [A]dear Lamb of God left His [A]glory above, To [E7]bear it to dark Calva[A]ry.


[Verse 4] 
In the [A]old rugged cross, stained with [D]blood so divine, A [E7]wondrous beauty I [A]see; For twas [A]on that old cross Jesus [D]suffered and died, To [E7]pardon and sanctify [A]me.


[Verse 5] 
To the [A]old rugged cross I will [D]ever be true, Its [E7]shame and reproach gladly [A]bear; Then He'll [A]call me some day to my [D]home far away, Where his [E7]glory forever I'll [A]share.
