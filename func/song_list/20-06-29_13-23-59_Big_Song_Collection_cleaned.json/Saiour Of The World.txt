[Verse 1] 
It's time for You and I to stand To march into our promised land To walk in faith, and not by what I see


[Verse 2] 
His favor rests upon us now We're clothed in righteousness and power It's time for us to shout the victory


[Verse 3] 
Lift your eyes to see Him Clothed in majesty Great and powerful is He


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, He conquered the grave Jesus, the Lamb that was slain Jesus, the savior of the world|| Jesus, He overcame sin Jesus, He's coming again Jesus, the savior of the world


[Verse 5] 
Jesus Jesus Jesus, the savior of the world
