[Verse 1] 
Woven together within the womb, Fearfully, wonderfully made; You know me better than I know myself, And still You look on with pleasure. ||Where can I go from Your Spirit, Lord? Where can I hide from Your gaze? Ocean to ocean and shore to shore, Your hand reaches out to guide me.


[Verse 2] 
It's all too wonderful For me to know; It's all too marvellous For me to attain. The care You show to those Who love Your name; It's all too wonderful, It's all too wonderful for me.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, You have searched me, You know me well, For nothing is hidden from You; And even before there's a word on my tongue, You know it completely, Lord. ||How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God, How great is the depth of Your love; I know that You've numbered the sum of my days, I'll rest in Your perfect wisdom.


[Verse 4] 
It's all too wonderful For me to know; It's all too marvellous For me to attain. The care You show to those Who love Your name; It's all too wonderful, It's all too wonderful for me.
