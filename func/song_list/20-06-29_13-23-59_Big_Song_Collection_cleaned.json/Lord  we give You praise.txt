[Verse 1] 
Lord, we give You praise; Our prayer of thanks to You we bring. We sing our songs to You, For praise belongs to You; Lord, we give You praise.


[Verse 2] 
Your love goes on and on; You never change, You never turn. Our hands we raise to You, And bring our praise to You; Lord, we give You praise.
