[Verse 1] 
How can I not praise You, When I consider all You've done? God of creation, all sufficient One. How can I not worship When I consider who You are? You are my Master, The One who has my heart.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah, praise the Lord, O my soul. Hallelujah, it is You I adore. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, I am saved! I am saved! Hallelujah, free to praise Your name. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.


[Verse 3] 
How can I not love You, When Your love reached deep down to me? Love so amazing, what a mystery. How can I not give my all, When You gave heaven's best to me? Jesus, my treasure for all eternity.


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah, praise the Lord, O my soul. Hallelujah, it is You I adore. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, I am saved! I am saved! Hallelujah, free to praise Your name. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
