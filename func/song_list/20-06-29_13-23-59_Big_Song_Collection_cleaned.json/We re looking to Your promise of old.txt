[Verse 1] 
We're looking to Your promise of old, That if we pray and humble ourselves, You will come and heal our land, You will come, You will come.


[Verse 2] 
We're looking to the promise You made, That if we turn and look to Your face, You will come and heal our land, You will come, You will come to us.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, send revival, start with me. For I am one of unclean lips, And my eyes have seen the King; Your glory I have glimpsed. Send revival, start with me.
