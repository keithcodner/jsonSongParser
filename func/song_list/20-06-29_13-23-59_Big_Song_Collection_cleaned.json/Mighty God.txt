[Verse 1] 
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Wonderful Counsellor, You're the Prince of Peace. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
You are Lord of heaven, You are called Emmanuel; God is now with us, Ever present to deliver. You are God eternal, You are Lord of all the earth; Love has come to us, Bringing us new birth.


[Verse 3] 
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Wonderful Counsellor, You're the Prince of Peace. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
A light to those in darkness, And a guide to paths of peace; Love and mercy dawns, Grace, forgiveness and salvation. Light for revelation, Glory to Your people; Son of the Most High, God's love gift to all. 


[Verse 5] 
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Wonderful Counsellor, You're the Prince of Peace. (Repeat)
