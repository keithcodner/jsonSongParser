[Verse 1] 
What things were gain to us We count them all as loss. Our pride, the things we've done, They're rubbish and they're dross. That we might know you fully, And be found in only You. Our righteousness isn't from the law; It's Your son that made us new.


[Verse 2] 
That we may know the power of Your resurrection. Not that we have already attained perfection, But one thing we do:


[Verse 3] 
Forgetting those things which are behind, We reach forward for the upward call of Christ. The call of Christ.|| Lord, strip us of what we hold dear, The worldly things that will never compare to You. Compare to You.


[Verse 4] 
Where lies your confidence? In what do you place worth? Only when you share His death Will faith, to you, give birth. Suffer with Him, know His power, Press on toward the goal. His righteousness will hold you true, His call is to be whole!


[Verse 5] 
That we may know the power of Your resurrection. Not that we have already attained perfection, But one thing we do:


[Verse 6] 
Forgetting those things which are behind, We reach forward for the upward call of Christ. The call of Christ.|| Lord, strip us of what we hold dear, The worldly things that will never compare to You. Compare to You.


[Verse 7] 
So eagerly we wait For Christ the Son to come; Our citizenship is found In heaven.


[Verse 8] 
Forgetting those things which are behind, We reach forward for the upward call of Christ. The call of Christ.|| Lord, strip us of what we hold dear, The worldly things that will never compare to You. Compare to You.


[Verse 9] 
Forgetting those things which are behind, We reach forward for the upward call of Christ. The call of Christ.|| Lord, strip us of what we hold dear, The worldly things that will never compare to You. Compare to You.
