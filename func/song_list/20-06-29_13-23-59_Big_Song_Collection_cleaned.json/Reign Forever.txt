[Verse 1] 
No mountain too high No valley too low That You cannot overcome


[Verse 2] 
No problem too great No need that You cannot fulfil Because of Your Power


[Verse 3] 
Saviour, Healer, Redeemer Creator, giver of life to all things


[Verse 4] 
I stand in awe of You I stand in awe of Your wonder and grace I stand in awe of You My God, You reign forever


[Verse 5] 
Jesus, King of kings Jesus, Lord of lords Jesus, King of kings And You reign forevermore
