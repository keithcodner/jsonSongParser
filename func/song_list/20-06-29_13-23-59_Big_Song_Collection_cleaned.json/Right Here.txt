[C]All the world is [Am]watching. [C]All the world doe[Am]s care. [C]Even when the wor[Am]ld weighs on my shoulder now, [C]These feelings I [Am]can bear [F]Because I know t[G]hat You're here.

[C]Everywhere I go, I [G]know You're not far away. [Am]You're right here. [F]You're right here. (2X)


[Verse 3] 
[C]All these thought[Am]s I've wasted, [C]All these thought[Am]s I've feared, [C]Even when these t[Am]houghts are faded, [C]I still know that[Am] You hear, [F]And I can rest my[G] hope in You. 


[Verse 4] 
[C]Everywhere I go, I [G]know You're not far away. [Am]You're right here. [F]You're right here. (2X)


[Verse 5] 
[Am]The many times that I have felt [F]alone, [Am]The many times that I have felt [F]the world was crashing down upon me, [Am]You always stood here by my [F]side. [G]You were always there.


[Verse 6] 
[C]Everywhere I go, I [G]know You're not far away. [Am]You're right here. [F]You're right here. (2X)


[Verse 7] 
[C]Everywhere I go, I [G]know You're not far away. [Am]You're right here. [F]You're right here. (2X)
