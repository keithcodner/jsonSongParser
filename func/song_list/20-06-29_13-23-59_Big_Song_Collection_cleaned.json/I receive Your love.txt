[Verse 1] 
I receive Your love, I receive Your love, In my heart I receive Your love, O Lord. I receive Your love By Your Spirit within me, I receive, I receive Your love.


[Verse 2] 
I confess Your love, I confess Your love, From my heart I confess Your love, O Lord. I confess Your love By Your Spirit within me, I confess, I confess Your love.
