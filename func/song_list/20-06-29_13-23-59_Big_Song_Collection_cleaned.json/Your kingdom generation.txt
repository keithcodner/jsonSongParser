[Verse 1] 
Your kingdom generation Declares Your majesty, And our lives are resounding with Your praise. We see Your Spirit moving, We burn with holy fire. ||Your glory is seen through all the earth. You set eternity in my heart, So I'll live for You, for You.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Honour and praise forever. We'll shout a victory cry from here To eternity. ||Hallelujah, hallelujah, We'll take our place in history. We'll shout Your awesome love from here To eternity.
