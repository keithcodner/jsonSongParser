[Verse 1] 
I have come home, I'm here again, Worn feet and ragged heart. Wasted my time, Wandered from ways that are best. I don't deserve from You Mercy that falls anew every day: All I want is You.


[Verse 2] 
You know my name, Call me Your friend, You draw me to Your side. Though I have failed, Fallen so far, still You care. Grace covers all my shame. Jesus, You took the blame, this is love: All I want is You.


[Verse 3] 
I am restored, Where I belong, At one with You again. With all my heart I choose to walk in Your ways. Held in Your strong embrace, No one will take Your place in my heart: All I want is You.
