[Verse 1] 
O the valleys shall ring With the sound of praise, And the lion shall lie with the lamb. Of His government there shall be no end, And His glory shall fill the earth.


[Verse 2] 
May Your will be done, May Your kingdom come, Let it rule, let it reign in our lives. There's a shout in the camp as we answer the call, Hail the King, Hail the Lord of Lords!
