[Verse 1] 
Image of invisible God, Creator and Sustainer of all; The King who came to ransom my soul, Thank You for Your perfect love.


[Verse 2] 
Holy One whom angels attend, Righteous King who calls me His friend; The Prince who offers peace without end, Thank You for Your perfect love.


[Verse 3] 
And it's You, O Lord, You're all that I could ask for, And in You, O Lord, I find the deepest joy: Fountain of life, ocean of mercy and peace. ||And it's You, O Lord, Who gives me strength to follow, And in You, O Lord, is grace for every day: Boundless in love, Fullness of heaven on earth.


[Verse 4] 
Therefore I will not be afraid, Though mountains fall and rivers may rage; I'm safe within the city You've made, Thank You for Your perfect love.


[Verse 5] 
And it's You, O Lord, You're all that I could ask for, And in You, O Lord, I find the deepest joy: Fountain of life, ocean of mercy and peace. ||And it's You, O Lord, Who gives me strength to follow, And in You, O Lord, is grace for every day: Boundless in love, Fullness of heaven on earth.
