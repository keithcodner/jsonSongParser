[Verse 1] 
[G]You are my [D]Strength when I am [Em]weak, You are the [G]Treasure that I [C]seek; You are my [G]All [D]in [G]All;[D] [G]Seeking You [D]as a precious [Em]Jewel, Lord, to give [G]up I'd be a [C]fool; You are my [G]All [D]in [G]All.


[Verse 2] 
[G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [G]God, [C]Worthy [G]is [D]Your [G]Name;[D] [G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [G]God, [C]Worthy [G]is [D]Your [G]Name.[D]


[Verse 3] 
[G]Taking my [D]sin, my cross my [Em]shame, Rising a[G]gain, I bless Your [C]name; You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all;[D] [G]When I fall [D]down You pick me [Em]up, When I am [G]dry You fill my [C]cup; You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all.


[Verse 4] 
[G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [G]God, [C]Worthy [G]is [D]Your [G]Name;[D] [G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [G]God, [C]Worthy [G]is [D]Your [G]Name.[D]


[Verse 5] 
Girls: Jesus, Lamb of God, Worthy is Your Name; Jesus, Lamb of God, Worthy is Your Name. Guys: Taking my sin, my cross my shame, Rising again, I bless Your name; You are my all in all; When I fall down You pick me up, When I am dry You fill my cup; You are my all in all.


[Verse 6] 
[G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [G]God, [C]Worthy [G]is [D]Your [G]Name;[D] [G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [G]God, [C]Worthy [G]is [D]Your [G]Name.[D]
