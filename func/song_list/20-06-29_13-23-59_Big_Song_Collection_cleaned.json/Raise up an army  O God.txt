[Verse 1] 
Raise up an army, O God, Awake Your people throughout the earth. Raise up an army, O God, To proclaim Your kingdom, To declare Your word, To declare Your glory, O God.


[Verse 2] 
Our hope, our heart, our vision, To see in every land Your chosen people coming forth. Fulfilling Your holy mission, United as we stand, Pledging our lives unto You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Raise up an army, O God, Awake Your people throughout the earth. Raise up an army, O God, To proclaim Your kingdom, To declare Your word, To declare Your glory, O God.


[Verse 4] 
O God, our glorious Maker, We marvel at Your grace, That You would use us in Your plan. Rejoicing at Your favour, Delighting in Your ways, We'll gladly follow Your command! 


[Verse 5] 
Raise up an army, O God, Awake Your people throughout the earth. Raise up an army, O God, To proclaim Your kingdom, To declare Your word, To declare Your glory, O God.
