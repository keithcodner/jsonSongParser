[Verse 1] 
In my life proclaim Your glory, In my heart reveal Your majesty; Then my soul shall speak the wonders of Your grace, And this heart of mine shall sing Your praise. ||In my words proclaim Your mercy, In my life reveal Your power; Then my soul shall be a mirror of Your love, And this heart of mine shall sing Your praise.


[Verse 2] 
Lord of all mercy, God of all grace, Lord of all righteousness; Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth Enthroned in majesty. Worthy of honour, worthy of praise, All glory and majesty; I give You the honour, I give You the praise, And proclaim Your glorious power.


[Verse 3] 
In my soul unveil Your love, Lord, Deep within my heart renewing me. Day by day your life transforming all I am, As this heart of mine reflects Your praise. ||Lord of all, enthroned in glory, Grace and mercy, truth and righteousness, Every knee shall bow before this Christ, our Lord, As all creation sings Your praise.
