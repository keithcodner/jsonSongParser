[Verse 1] 
The sky is filled with the glory of God. Triumphantly the angels sing: 'Rejoice, good news, a Saviour is born, And life will never be the same.'


[Verse 2] 
Emmanuel. Emmanuel. Emmanuel.


[Verse 3] 
Praise and adoration spring from our hearts, We lift our voices unto You; You are the One, God's only Son, King of kings forever more! 


[Verse 4] 
Emmanuel. Emmanuel. Emmanuel.
