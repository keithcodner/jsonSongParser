[Verse 1] 
You purchased men with precious blood, From every nation, tribe and tongue; Brought from slavery, freed from prison chains; Brought through death so they might rise again, Born to serve and to reign:


[Verse 2] 
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Highest honour, and glory, and power, and praise! Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Highest honour, and glory, and praise!


[Verse 3] 
Holy, holy to our God, Who was, and is, and is to come; Let us join the throng who see His face, Bowing down to Him both night and day, Lost in wonder and praise. 


[Verse 4] 
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Highest honour, and glory, and power, and praise! Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Highest honour, and glory, and praise!
