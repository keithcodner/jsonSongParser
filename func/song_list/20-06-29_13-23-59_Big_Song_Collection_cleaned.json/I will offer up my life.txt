[Verse 1] 
I will offer up my life In spirit and truth, Pouring out the oil of love As my worship to You. In surrender I must give my every part; Lord, receive the sacrifice Of a broken heart.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, what can I give, What can I bring To so faithful a friend, To so loving a King? Saviour, what can be said, What can be sung As a praise of Your name For the things You have done? || Oh, my words could not tell, Not even in part, Of the debt of love that is owed By this thankful heart.


[Verse 3] 
You deserve my every breath For You've paid the great cost; Giving up Your life to death, Even death on a cross. You took all my shame away, There defeated my sin, Opened up the gates of heaven, And have beckoned me in. 


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, what can I give, What can I bring To so faithful a friend, To so loving a King? Saviour, what can be said, What can be sung As a praise of Your name For the things You have done? || Oh, my words could not tell, Not even in part, Of the debt of love that is owed By this thankful heart.
