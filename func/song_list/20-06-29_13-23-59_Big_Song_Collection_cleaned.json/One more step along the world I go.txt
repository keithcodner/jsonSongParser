[Verse 1] 
One more step along the world I go, One more step along the world I go, From the old things to the new, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 2] 
And it's from the old I travel to the new, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 3] 
Round the corners of the world I turn, More and more about the world I learn. All the new things that I see, You'll be looking at along with me.


[Verse 4] 
And it's from the old I travel to the new, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 5] 
As I travel through the bad and good, Keep me travelling the way I should. Where I see no way to go, You'll be telling me the way, I know.


[Verse 6] 
And it's from the old I travel to the new, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 7] 
Give me courage when the world is rough, Keep me loving when the world is tough. Leap and sing in all I do, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 8] 
And it's from the old I travel to the new, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 9] 
You are older than the world can be, You are younger than the life in me. Ever old and ever new, Keep me travelling along with You.


[Verse 10] 
And it's from the old I travel to the new, Keep me travelling along with You.
