[Verse 1] 
I have made You too small in my eyes; O Lord, forgive me. And I have believed in a lie That You were unable to heal me. ||But now, O Lord, I see my wrong; Heal my heart, and show Yourself strong. And in my eyes and with my song, O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified.


[Verse 2] 
Be magnified, O Lord; You are highly exalted. And there is nothing You can't do, O Lord, my eyes are on You, Be magnified, O Lord, be magnified.


[Verse 3] 
I have leaned on the wisdom of men; O God, forgive me. And I have responded to them Instead of Your light and Your mercy. ||But now, O Lord, I see my wrong; Heal my heart and show Yourself strong. And in my eyes and with my song, O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified. 


[Verse 4] 
Be magnified, O Lord; You are highly exalted. And there is nothing You can't do, O Lord, my eyes are on You, Be magnified, O Lord, be magnified.
