[Verse 1] 
[E] Through You the blind will see.|Through You the mute will sing. [A2] Through You the dead will rise.|Through You all hearts will praise [C#m7] Through You the darkness flees[Bsus].| Through You my heart screams, "I am [E]free!"


[Verse 2] 
I am f[E]ree to run!|(I am free to run!) I am f[A2]ree to dance! (I am free to dance!) I am f[C#m7]ree to live for You! (I am [Bsus]free to live for You!) I am free![E] (I am free!)


[Verse 3] 
[E] Through You the kingdom comes.|Through You the battle's won. [A2] Through You I'm not afraid.|Through You the price is paid. [C#m7] Through You this victory[Bsus].| Because of You my heart sings, "I am [E]free!"


[Verse 4] 
[E] Through You the kingdom comes.|Through You the battle's won. [A2] Through You I'm not afraid.|Through You the price is paid. [C#m7] Through You this victory[Bsus].| Because of You my heart sings, "I am [E]free!"


[Verse 5] 
[E] Who the Son sets free is [A2]free indeed (2x)


[Verse 6] 
[E] Through You the kingdom comes.|Through You the battle's won. [A2] Through You I'm not afraid.|Through You the price is paid. [C#m7] Through You this victory[Bsus].| Because of You my heart sings, "I am [E]free!"


[Verse 7] 
I am f[E]ree to run! (I am free to run!) I am f[A2]ree to dance! (I am free to dance!) I am f[C#m7]ree to live for You! (I am [Bsus]free to live for You!) I am free![E] (I am free!) Yes, I am free! (I am free!)
