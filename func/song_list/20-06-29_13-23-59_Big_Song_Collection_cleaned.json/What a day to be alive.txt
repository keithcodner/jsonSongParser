[Verse 1] 
What a day to be alive, What a time to live my life, To have a destiny and call, And see it day by day unfold. ||What a day to know You, Lord, To live and walk within Your love, To see the wondrous things You've done, And know there's greater things to come.


[Verse 2] 
And we sense the wonder of it all, We feel the urgency; There's not a day to be wasted. God, help Your church, help us to see.


[Verse 3] 
This is our time, this is our day; Now's not the time to hold back or delay. Dreams can live again, Faith and hope restored. ||Taste and see that the Lord is good; This is the day of salvation, A time to break free from containment. People need, people need the Lord.
