[Verse 1] 
I can only im[D]agine[Dmaj7] what it will be like when I [G2]walk by your side. I can only im[D]agine[Dmaj7] what my eyes will see when Your [G2]face is before me. I can only im[D]agine.[A] I can only i[D]magine.


[Verse 2] 
Sur[G2]rounded by Your glory, what [A]will my heart feel? Will I [D]dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still?|| Will I [G2]stand in Your presence or to my [A]knees will I fall? Will I [D]sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all? I can only i[G2]magine[A]. I can only i[D]magine.


[Verse 3] 
I can only im[D]agine[Dmaj7] when that day comes and I [G2]find myself standing in the Son. I can only im[D]agine[Dmaj7] when all I will do is for[G2]ever, forever worship You. I can only im[D]agine.[A] I can only i[D]magine.


[Verse 4] 
Sur[G2]rounded by Your glory, what [A]will my heart feel? Will I [D]dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still?|| Will I [G2]stand in Your presence or to my [A]knees will I fall? Will I [D]sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all? I can only i[G2]magine[A]. I can only i[D]magine.


[Verse 5] 
I can only im[D]agine.[A] I can only i[D]magine.
