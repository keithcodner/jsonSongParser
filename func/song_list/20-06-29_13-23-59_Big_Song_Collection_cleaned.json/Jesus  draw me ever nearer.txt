[Verse 1] 
Jesus, draw me ever nearer, As I labour through the storm. You have called me to this passage, And I'll follow, though I'm worn.


[Verse 2] 
May this journey bring a blessing, May I rise on wings of faith: And at the end of my heart's testing, With Your likeness let me wake.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, guide me through the tempest, Keep my spirit staid and sure. When the midnight meets the morning, Let me love You even more.


[Verse 4] 
May this journey bring a blessing, May I rise on wings of faith: And at the end of my heart's testing, With Your likeness let me wake.


[Verse 5] 
Let the treasures of the trial Form within me as I go. And at the end of this long passage, Let me leave them at Your throne.


[Verse 6] 
May this journey bring a blessing, May I rise on wings of faith: And at the end of my heart's testing, With Your likeness let me wake.
