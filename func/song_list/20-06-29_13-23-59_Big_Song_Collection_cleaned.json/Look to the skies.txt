[Verse 1] 
Look to the skies, There's a celebration, Lift up your heads, Join the angel song, For our Creator Becomes our Saviour, As a baby born! || Angels, amazed, Bow in adoration: 'Glory to God In the highest heaven!' Send the good news Out to every nation For our hope has come.


[Verse 2] 
Worship the King - Come, see His brightness; Worship the King, His wonders tell: Jesus our King is born today; We welcome You, Emmanuel!


[Verse 3] 
Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Father for ever, The Prince of Peace: There'll be no end To Your rule of justice, For it shall increase. || Light of Your face, Come to pierce our darkness; Joy of Your heart Come to chase our gloom; Star of the morning, A new day dawning, Make our hearts Your home.


[Verse 4] 
Worship the King - Come, see His brightness; Worship the King, His wonders tell: Jesus our King is born today; We welcome You, Emmanuel!


[Verse 5] 
Quietly He came As a helpless baby - One day in power He will come again; Swift through the skies He will burst with splendour On the earth to reign. || Jesus, I bow at Your manger lowly: Now in my life let Your will be done; Live in my flesh By Your Spirit holy Till Your kingdom comes. 


[Verse 6] 
Worship the King - Come, see His brightness; Worship the King, His wonders tell: Jesus our King is born today; We welcome You, Emmanuel!
