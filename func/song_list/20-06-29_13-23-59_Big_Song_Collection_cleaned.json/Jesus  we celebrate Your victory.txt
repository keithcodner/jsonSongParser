[Verse 1] 
Jesus, we celebrate Your victory: Jesus, we revel in Your love. Jesus, we rejoice, You've set us free; Jesus, Your death has Brought us life.


[Verse 2] 
It was for freedom that Christ has set us free, No longer to be subject to a yoke of slavery; So we're rejoicing in God's victory, Our hearts responding to His love.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, we celebrate Your victory: Jesus, we revel in Your love. Jesus, we rejoice, You've set us free; Jesus, Your death has Brought us life.


[Verse 4] 
His Spirit in us releases us from fear, The way to Him is open, with boldness we draw near; And in His presence our problems disappear, Our hearts responding to His love. 


[Verse 5] 
Jesus, we celebrate Your victory: Jesus, we revel in Your love. Jesus, we rejoice, You've set us free; Jesus, Your death has Brought us life.
