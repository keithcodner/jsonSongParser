[Verse 1] 
We will glorify the King of kings, We will glorify the Lamb; We will glorify the Lord of Lords, Who is the great 'I Am'.


[Verse 2] 
Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty, We will bow before His throne; We will worship Him in righteousness, We worship Him alone.


[Verse 3] 
He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, He is Lord of all who live; He is Lord above the universe, All praise to Him we give.


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah to the King of kings, Hallelujah to the Lamb; Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords, Who is the great 'l Am'.
