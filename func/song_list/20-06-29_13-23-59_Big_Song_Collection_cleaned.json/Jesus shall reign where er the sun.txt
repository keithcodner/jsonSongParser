[Verse 1] 
Jesus shall reign where'er the sun Doth his successive journeys run; His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, Till moons shall wax and wane no more.


[Verse 2] 
For Him shall endless prayer be made, And praises throng to crown His head; His name like sweet perfume shall rise With every morning sacrifice.


[Verse 3] 
People and realms of every tongue Dwell on His love with sweetest song, And infant voices shall proclaim Their early blessings on His name.


[Verse 4] 
Blessings abound where'er He reigns; The prisoner leaps to lose his chains; The weary find eternal rest, And all the sons of want are blessed.


[Verse 5] 
Let every creature rise and bring Peculiar honours to our King; Angels descend with songs again, And earth repeat the loud Amen!
