[Verse 1] 
O Lord, when I wake up in the morning, Let my mouth be filled with praise for You. O Lord, when I go out in the evening, Let my mouth be filled with praise for You. ||That all might know, yeah, And many might see, yeah, That You're my Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Fill me with a spirit of boldness, O my God, And come and take all of my shame; That I might see temptation Melt before my eyes And watch the demons flee in Jesus' name, As we lift high the name.


[Verse 3] 
Lift high the name of the Lord. Lift high the name of the Lord. That many might know, That many might see my Lord.


[Verse 4] 
O Lord, when I'm stressed and feeling tired, Let my mouth be filled with praise to You. O Lord, when I'm pressed on every side, Let my mouth be filled with praise to You. ||That all might know, yeah, And many might see, yeah, That You are Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Lift high the name of the Lord. Lift high the name of the Lord. That many might know, That many might see my Lord.
