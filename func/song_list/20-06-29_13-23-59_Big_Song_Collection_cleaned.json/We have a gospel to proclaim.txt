[Verse 1] 
We have a gospel to proclaim, Good news for all throughout the earth; The gospel of a Saviour's name: We sing His glory, tell His worth.


[Verse 2] 
Tell of His birth at Bethlehem, Not in a royal house or hall But in a stable dark and dim: The Word made flesh, a light for all.


[Verse 3] 
Tell of His death at Calvary, Hated by those He came to save; In lonely suffering on the cross For all He loved His life He gave.


[Verse 4] 
Tell of that glorious Easter morn: Empty the tomb, for He was free. He broke the power of death and hell That we might share His victory.


[Verse 5] 
Tell of His reign at God's right hand, By all creation glorified; He sends His Spirit on His Church To live for Him, the Lamb who died.


[Verse 6] 
Now we rejoice to name Him King: Jesus is Lord of all the earth. This gospel message we proclaim: We sing His glory, tell His worth.
