[Verse 1] 
I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart, I will sing glorious praises to Your name; I will be glad and exalt in You, my Lord, Yesterday, today, forever, You're the same.


[Verse 2] 
O Most High, You who are my stronghold, When troubles come, You're my hiding place; O Most High, Those who know You trust You, You will not forsake the ones Who seek Your face.
