[Verse 1] 
Revival! We're praying for revival, That Your kingdom may come, Your will may be done Throughout this land. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Send now Your Spirit, Lord, may He come; Cause us to glorify Jesus Your Son, That all in this nation might know He is the Lord. ||Send now Your Spirit, let truth arise; Where darkness has blinded, open closed eyes, Bring spiritual health to this nation As we cry to You: Come heal our land. Come heal our land. Come heal our land. Come heal our land.
