[Verse 1] 
You are my King, I live to know You. Oh, to walk in the fullness of Your Spirit. I'll abide in You and You in me, I'll see Your desire fulfilled within me.


[Verse 2] 
I am changed by You Into Your image. I am changed by You, I become the same. I am changed by You, Like my Father God, King of heaven. King of heaven.


[Verse 3] 
You placed in me a fire when I met You, And the flame, it just burns brighter and brighter. I'm coming after You with all that's in me, I need You more and more each time I wake.


[Verse 4] 
I am changed by You Into Your image. I am changed by You, I become the same. I am changed by You, Like my Father God, King of heaven. King of heaven.


[Verse 5] 
Glory to glory to glory, Lord, We will never be the same. Glory to glory to glory, Lord, Oh, we will never, never be the same.


[Verse 6] 
I am changed by You Into Your image. I am changed by You, I become the same. I am changed by You, Like my Father God, King of heaven. King of heaven.
