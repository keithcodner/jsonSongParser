[Verse 1] 
What can I say but 'I love You'? What can I say but 'I praise You'? As the train of Your robe fills this temple, As the sound of Your voice fills this place. ||What can I do but to bow down? What can I do but to worship? Only You are the One who is worthy, Only You are the One who is Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Great is the Lord, so great is the Lord, Righteous and true God, holy and pure. I fall on my knees confessing my need For more of Your presence, Lord.
