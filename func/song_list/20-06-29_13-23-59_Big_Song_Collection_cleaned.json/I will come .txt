[Verse 1] 
I will come, come, come to the waters and drink; I will praise, praise, praise Your name again. I will rest, rest, rest, rest at Your feet, For You have won my heart once again.


[Verse 2] 
I will thirst, thirst, thirst for all that You give; And I will fall, fall, fall into Your arms again. I will call, call, call to You alone each day, For You have won my heart once again.


[Verse 3] 
And You are God, With fire in Your eyes, And You are God, Adorned in radiant light. You are God Whose hands were pierced for all: What choice do I have, But to give You my very all?


[Verse 4] 
I shall wait, wait, wait at the cross where we meet; And I will live, live, live, by Your name I speak. I will run, run, run for Your face to seek, For You have won my heart once again.


[Verse 5] 
And You are God, With fire in Your eyes, And You are God, Adorned in radiant light. You are God Whose hands were pierced for all: What choice do I have, But to give You my very all?
