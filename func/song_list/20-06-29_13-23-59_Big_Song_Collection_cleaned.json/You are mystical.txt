[Verse 1] 
You are mystical and deep. You take Your rest, but never sleep. You watch me like a mother does, Every scar and every tear and fall. ||You suffer long, but Your patience waits, Your judgement always hesitates. Your anger stays a moment, Yet Your favour lasts a whole life long.


[Verse 2] 
And I cannot stand silently When faced with so much grace. My chest is pounding with the need To celebrate You, God, And the miracle of Your love.


[Verse 3] 
For You're everywhere, in every place, In every time, in every space, And every breath that I take You lend. You're the only One who satisfies, The only One who makes my life make sense.


[Verse 4] 
You are generous and kind, So intimate and close at times, Yet You reveal Your beauty in the twilight And the summer evening rain. ||You're in the rainbow and the dawn, You steal my breath and then You're gone, Yet when the morning sun breaks through, I look for You and You are here again.


[Verse 5] 
For You're everywhere, in every place, In every time, in every space, And every breath that I take You lend. You're the only One who satisfies, The only One who makes my life make sense.
