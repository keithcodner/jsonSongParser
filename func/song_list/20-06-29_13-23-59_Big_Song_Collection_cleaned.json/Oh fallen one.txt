[Verse 1] 
Oh fallen one, covered now in shame, He is your hope, He is your life. Though He should judge, His anger turns away; Rise from the dust, beautiful one.


[Verse 2] 
Don't be afraid, For you're not left alone; His heart of love is broken for you. Your Father cares For all your children now, Arise in His name, beautiful one.


[Verse 3] 
Arise and shine, your glory has come, Arise and shine, your glory has come, Arise and shine, He is calling you by name; Though your walls have fallen down, He'll build you up again.


[Verse 4] 
Lift up your eyes, Many come to see The splendour your God has given to you. Could each of your saints Become a thousand saints? Rise up and praise, beautiful one.


[Verse 5] 
Arise and shine, your glory has come, Arise and shine, your glory has come, Arise and shine, He is calling you by name; Though your walls have fallen down, He'll build you up again.


[Verse 6] 
So let Your salvation come, For Your glory, Lord. Set the captives free, we pray; These souls are Your reward.


[Verse 7] 
Arise and shine, your glory has come, Arise and shine, your glory has come, Arise and shine, He is calling you by name; Though your walls have fallen down, He'll build you up again.
