[Verse 1] 
He is the Lord, and He reigns on high: He is the Lord. Spoke into the darkness, created the light: He is the Lord. ||Who is like unto Him, never ending in days? He is the Lord. And He comes in power when we call on His name: He is the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
He is the Lord, and He reigns on high: He is the Lord. Spoke into the darkness, created the light: He is the Lord. ||Who is like unto Him, never ending in days? He is the Lord. And He comes in power when we call on His name: He is the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Your gospel, O Lord, is the hope for our nation: You are the Lord. It's the power of God for our salvation: You are the Lord. ||We ask not for riches, but look to the cross: You are the Lord. And for our inheritance give us the lost: You are the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Your gospel, O Lord, is the hope for our nation: You are the Lord. It's the power of God for our salvation: You are the Lord. ||We ask not for riches, but look to the cross: You are the Lord. And for our inheritance give us the lost: You are the Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Show Your power, O Lord our God. Show Your power, O Lord our God, Our God.


[Verse 6] 
Send Your power, O Lord our God. Send Your power, O Lord our God, Our God.
