[Verse 1] 
Be lifted up, be lifted up. As we bow down, Be lifted up. Be lifted up, be lifted up. As we bow down, Be lifted up.


[Verse 2] 
Let the heavens rejoice, Let the nations be glad. Let the whole earth tremble, For You are God. Come and worship the Lord In the beauty of holiness.


[Verse 3] 
As we bow down, Be lifted up. As we bow down, Be lifted up.
