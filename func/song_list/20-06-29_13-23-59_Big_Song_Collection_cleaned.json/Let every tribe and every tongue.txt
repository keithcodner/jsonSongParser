[Verse 1] 
Let every tribe and every tongue Bring praise to the Lamb, For He has triumphed over all, He has triumphed. With His blood He has redeemed us Forever to reign with Him in glory, amen.


[Verse 2] 
We sing glory, glory to the Lamb; Son of God, the Great I AM. Awesome in splendour, triumphant King, We give You praise and dominion over all.


[Verse 3] 
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb; Holy, resurrected Lamb. Jesus, King Jesus, pre-eminent God, We give You praise, We give You praise over all.
