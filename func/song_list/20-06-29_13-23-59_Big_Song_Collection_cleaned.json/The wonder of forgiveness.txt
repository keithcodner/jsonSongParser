[Verse 1] 
The wonder of forgiveness, The comfort of Your love, The all-surpassing pleasure To be a friend of God. Your thoughts to me are endless, This joy will never end.


[Verse 2] 
All I want to say is 'I love You', All I want to give is my heart. All I want to do is be near You, And to walk in Your ways. Resting in the peace of Your promise, Trusting in the cross that You bore, Looking for the day when I see You, Lord, I thank You for Your faithfulness to me.


[Verse 3] 
I'm laying down my treasures To claim the perfect prize. I'm pulling back the curtain To look into Your eyes. You know my inhibitions, But You can meet me here.


[Verse 4] 
All I want to say is 'I love You', All I want to give is my heart. All I want to do is be near You, And to walk in Your ways. Resting in the peace of Your promise, Trusting in the cross that You bore, Looking for the day when I see You, Lord, I thank You for Your faithfulness to me.
