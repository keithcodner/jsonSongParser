[Verse 1] 
How lovely is Your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty. My soul longs and even faints for You. For here my heart is satisfied, Within Your presence. I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.


[Verse 2] 
Better is one day in Your courts, Better is one day in Your house, Better is one day in Your courts Than thousands elsewhere. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
One thing I ask and I would seek; To see Your beauty, To find You in the place Your glory dwells.


[Verse 4] 
Better is one day in Your courts, Better is one day in Your house, Better is one day in Your courts Than thousands elsewhere. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
My heart and flesh cry out For You, the living God; Your Spirit's water for my soul. I've tasted and I've seen, Come once again to me; I will draw near to You, I will draw near to You. 


[Verse 6] 
Better is one day in Your courts, Better is one day in Your house, Better is one day in Your courts Than thousands elsewhere. (Repeat)
