[Verse 1] 
[F#m]Magnificent, [E]Holy [A]Father, [F#m]I stand in [E]awe of all I [A]see. [D]Of all the [A]things You have cre[F#m]ated, [D]but still You choose to think of [E]me.


[Verse 2] 
[F#m]And who am I[E] that You should [A]suffer [F#m]Your very [E]life to set me [A]free? [D]The only [A]thing that I can [F#m]offer [D]is the [A]life You gave to [E]me.


[Verse 3] 
This is my [D]offering, dear [A]Lord. This is my [D]offering to You, [E]God. I will [F#m]give You my [E]life, for it's [A]all I have to [D]give, Because You gave Your [E]life for [F#m]me.[E][A][F#m][E][A]


[Verse 4] 
[F#m]I stand be[E]fore You at this [A]alter; [F#m]so many [E]have given You [A]more. [D]I may not [A]have much I can [F#m]offer, [D]yet what I [A]have is truly [E]Yours.


[Verse 5] 
This is my [D]offering, dear [A]Lord. This is my [D]offering to You, [E]God. I will [F#m]give You my [E]life, for it's [A]all I have to [D]give, Because You gave Your [E]life for [F#m]me.[E][A][F#m][E][A]
