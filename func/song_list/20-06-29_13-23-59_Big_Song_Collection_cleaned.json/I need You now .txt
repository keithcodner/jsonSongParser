[Verse 1] 
I need You now, My King, my Love; I am more aware this clay Than all Your power within. I wait for You, My Hope, my Love, Because I've dreamed I'd see Your kingdom come and I still believe.


[Verse 2] 
So come and breathe on me now, I am poured out for You. Come and release Your power. I'm crying out to You, I'm crying out to You.


[Verse 3] 
What works have I? What fruit to show? I can hardly stand before Your grace, Yet I, I know Your love, Your grace Has lifted me, But I need You now so I can build With gold, pure gold.


[Verse 4] 
So come and breathe on me now, I am poured out for You. Come and release Your power. I'm crying out to You, I'm crying out to You.


[Verse 5] 
Your promise alone Should be enough for me. Still I'm crying out, 'I need Your touch.'


[Verse 6] 
So come and breathe on me now, I am poured out for You. Come and release Your power. I'm crying out to You, I'm crying out to You.
