[Verse 1] 
[G]I am so glad that our Father in heaven [D7]Tells of His love in the [C]Book He [D7]has [G]given. [G]Wonderful things in my Bible I see- [D7]This is the dearest, that [C]Jesus [D7]loves [G]me.


[Verse 2] 
[G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me, [D7]Jesus loves me, [G]Jesus loves me. [G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me; [D7]Jesus loves [C]e[D]ven [G]me.


[Verse 3] 
[G]Tho' I forget Him and wander away, [D7]Still He doth love me wher[C]ever [D7]I [G]stray. [G]Back to His dear, loving arms would I flee [D7]When I remember that [C]Jesus [D7]loves [G]me.


[Verse 4] 
[G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me, [D7]Jesus loves me, [G]Jesus loves me. [G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me; [D7]Jesus loves [C]e[D]ven [G]me.


[Verse 5] 
[G]O if there's only one song I can sing [D7]When in His beauty I [C]see the [D7]great [G]King, [G]This shall my song in eternity be: [D7]"O what a wonder, that [C]Jesus [D7]loves [G]me!"


[Verse 6] 
[G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me, [D7]Jesus loves me, [G]Jesus loves me. [G]I am so glad that [C]Jesus loves me; [D7]Jesus loves [C]e[D]ven [G]me.
