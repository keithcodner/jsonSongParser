[Verse 1] 
[E]It's the [D]song of the redeemed [A/C#]rising from the African [E]plain. It's the [D]song of the forgiven [A/C#]drowning out the Amazon [E]rain.|| The song of [D]Asian believers [A/C#]filled with God's holy [E]fire. It's ev'ry tribe, ev'ry [D]tongue, ev'ry nation;|a [A/C#]love song born of a grateful [E]choir.


[Verse 2] 
It's all God's children singing,|"[D]Glory, glory, [A]hallelujah!|He [E]reigns, He reigns!" It's all God's children singing,|"[D]Glory, glory, [A]hallelujah!|He [E]reigns, He reigns!"


[Verse 3] 
Let it [D]rise above the four winds, [A/C#]caught up in the heavenly [E]sound. Let praises echo from the [D]towers of cathedrals|to the [A/C#]faithful gathered under[E]ground.|| Of all the songs sung from the [D]dawn of creation,|[A/C#]some were meant to per[E]sist. Of all the bells rung from a [D]thousand steeples,|[A/C#]none rings truer than [E]this:


[Verse 4] 
It's all God's children singing,|"[D]Glory, glory, [A]hallelujah!|He [E]reigns, He reigns!" It's all God's children singing,|"[D]Glory, glory, [A]hallelujah!|He [E]reigns, He reigns!"


[Verse 5] 
And all the [A/E]powers of darkness [D/F#]tremble at what they've just [E]heard, 'Cause all the [A/E]powers of darkness [D/F#]can't drown out a single [E]word.


[Verse 6] 
It's all God's children singing,|"[D]Glory, glory, [A]hallelujah!|He [E]reigns, He reigns!" It's all God's children singing,|"[D]Glory, glory, [A]hallelujah!|He [E]reigns, He reigns!"
