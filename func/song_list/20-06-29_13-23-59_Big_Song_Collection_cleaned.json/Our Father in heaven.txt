[Verse 1] 
Our Father in heaven, Holy is Your name. Forgive us our sins, Lord, As we forgive. Our Father in heaven, Give us our bread. Lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one.


[Verse 2] 
Your kingdom come, Your will be done. Your kingdom come, Your will be done On the earth as it is in heaven. Let it be done on the earth. Amen. Amen.
