[Verse 1] 
If I were a butterfly, I'd thank You, Lord, for giving me wings. And if I were a robin in a tree, I'd thank You, Lord, that I could sing. ||And if I were a fish in the sea, I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee; But I just thank You, Father, For making me 'me'.


[Verse 2] 
For You gave me a heart And You gave me a smile, You gave me Jesus And You made me Your child, And I just thank You, Father, For making me 'me'.


[Verse 3] 
If I were an elephant, I'd thank You, Lord, by raising my trunk. And if I were a kangaroo, You know I'd hop right up to You. ||And if I were an octopus, I'd thank You, Lord, for my fine looks; But I just thank You, Father, For making me 'me'.


[Verse 4] 
For You gave me a heart And You gave me a smile, You gave me Jesus And You made me Your child, And I just thank You, Father, For making me 'me'.


[Verse 5] 
If I were a wiggily worm, I'd thank You, Lord, that I could squirm. And if I were a billy goat, I'd thank You, Lord, for my strong throat. ||And if I were a fuzzy-wuzzy bear, I'd thank You, Lord, for my fuzzy-wuzzy hair; But I just thank You, Father, For making me 'me'. 


[Verse 6] 
For You gave me a heart And You gave me a smile, You gave me Jesus And You made me Your child, And I just thank You, Father, For making me 'me'.
