[Verse 1] 
I have come to love You, I have come to love You today. I have come to love You, I have come to love You today.


[Verse 2] 
And today and forever more I'll love Your name. And today and forever more I'll love Your name.


[Verse 3] 
I have come to worship, I have come to worship today. I have come to worship, I have come to worship today.


[Verse 4] 
I have come to thank You, I have come to thank You today. I have come to thank You, I have come to thank You today.
