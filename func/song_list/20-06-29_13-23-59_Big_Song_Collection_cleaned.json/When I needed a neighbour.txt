[Verse 1] 
When I needed a neighbour, Were you there, were you there? When I needed a neighbour, were you there?


[Verse 2] 
And the creed and the colour And the name won't matter, Were you there?


[Verse 3] 
I was hungry and thirsty, Were you there, were you there? I was hungry and thirsty, were you there?


[Verse 4] 
And the creed and the colour And the name won't matter, Were you there?


[Verse 5] 
I was cold, I was naked, Were you there, were you there? I was cold, I was naked, were you there?


[Verse 6] 
And the creed and the colour And the name won't matter, Were you there?


[Verse 7] 
When I needed a shelter, Were you there, were you there? When I needed a shelter, were you there?


[Verse 8] 
And the creed and the colour And the name won't matter, Were you there?


[Verse 9] 
When I needed a healer, Were you there, were you there? When I needed a healer, were you there?


[Verse 10] 
And the creed and the colour And the name won't matter, Were you there?


[Verse 11] 
Wherever you travel, I'll be there, I'll be there. Wherever you travel, I'll be there.


[Verse 12] 
I was hungry and thirsty, Were you there, were you there? I was hungry and thirsty, were you there?


[Verse 13] 
And the creed and the colour And the name won't matter, I'll be there.
