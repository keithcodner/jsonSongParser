[Verse 1] 
Lord, Your glory fills my heart, Your presence deep within me stirs my soul. O Lord, how awesome are Your ways, Your majesty surrounding all the earth.


[Verse 2] 
All wisdom and honour and glory forever, All power and greatness and splendour, They are Yours above all others, my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, Your Spirit moves me now, I see a picture of Your holiness. O Lord, I look into Your eyes, And feel a fire burn into my heart. 


[Verse 4] 
All wisdom and honour and glory forever, All power and greatness and splendour, They are Yours above all others, my Lord.
