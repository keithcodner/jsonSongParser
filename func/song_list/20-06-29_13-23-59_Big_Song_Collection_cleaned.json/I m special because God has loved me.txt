[Verse 1] 
I'm special Because God has loved me, For He gave the best thing That He had to save me; His own Son Jesus, Crucified to take the blame For all the bad things I have done.


[Verse 2] 
Thank You Jesus, thank You Lord, For loving me so much. I know I don't deserve anything. Help me feel Your love right now, To know deep in my heart That I'm Your special friend.
