[Verse 1] 
You rescued me, and picked me up, A living hope of grace revealed, A life transformed in righteousness, O Lord You have rescued me. Forgiving me, You healed my heart, And set me free from sin and death. You brought me life, You made me whole, O Lord, You have rescued me.


[Verse 2] 
And You loved me before I knew You, And You knew me for all time. I've been created in Your image, O Lord. ||And You bought me, and You sought me, Your blood poured out for me; A new creation in Your image, O Lord. You rescued me, You rescued me.
