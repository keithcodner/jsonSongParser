[Verse 1] 
This I know, my God is for me, This I know. This I know, my God is on my side; My God is for me, this I know.


[Verse 2] 
If God did not spare His only Son, But delivered Him up for us all, Will He not give us every good thing When we come in His name and call?


[Verse 3] 
This I know, my God is for me, This I know. This I know, my God is on my side; My God is for me, this I know.


[Verse 4] 
Let us draw near the throne of grace For mercy and help in our need; For Jesus is ever praying for us, He is living to intercede. 


[Verse 5] 
This I know, my God is for me, This I know. This I know, my God is on my side; My God is for me, this I know.
