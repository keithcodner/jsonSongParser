[Verse 1] 
The waves are breaking, the tide is turning, God's Spirit is coming to this earth; The harvest is waiting, And we have been called To go to the nations of this world.


[Verse 2] 
To the ends of the earth, To the ends of the earth, To the ends of the earth we will go; Bearing the message That our God can be known, To the ends of the earth we will go.


[Verse 3] 
The fire is falling, the wind is blowing, The flame is spreading across our land; Revival is coming, let the world hear, Tell every woman, child and man.


[Verse 4] 
To the ends of the earth, To the ends of the earth, To the ends of the earth we will go; Bearing the message That our God can be known, To the ends of the earth we will go.


[Verse 5] 
The drums are beating, The trumpet is sounding, A warrior spirit He's put in our hearts; In the name of the Father, Spirit and Son, We'll take this word to everyone. 


[Verse 6] 
To the ends of the earth, To the ends of the earth, To the ends of the earth we will go; Bearing the message That our God can be known, To the ends of the earth we will go.
