[Verse 1] 
We confess the sins of our nation, And, Lord, we are guilty Of a prayerless life. We've turned away our hearts from Your laws, And have taken for granted Your unchanging grace. ||Turn away this curse from our country; We say that we've robbed You, And our storehouses are bare. Open wide the floodgates of heaven, Rebuke the devourer so we may not be destroyed.


[Verse 2] 
You said that if we'd humble ourselves And begin to pray, You would heal our barren land, And cleanse us with Your rain.


[Verse 3] 
Don't pass us by, Let this be the generation, Lord, That lifts up Your name to all the world. Save us, O God, Save a people for Yourself, O Lord, Let the fear of the Lord be a standard. ||Save us, O God, Cleanse us from our unfaithfulness, Let the place where we live Be called a house of prayer.
