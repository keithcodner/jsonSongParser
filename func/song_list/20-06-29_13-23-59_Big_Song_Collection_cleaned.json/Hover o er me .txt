[Verse 1] 
Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit, Bathe my trembling heart and brow; Fill me with Thy hallowed presence, Come, O come and fill me now.


[Verse 2] 
Fill me now, fill me now, Jesus, come and fill me now. Fill me with Thy hallowed presence, Jesus, come and fill me now.


[Verse 3] 
Thou can fill me, gracious Spirit, Though I cannot tell Thee how; But I need Thee, greatly need Thee, Come, O come and fill me now.


[Verse 4] 
Fill me now, fill me now, Jesus, come and fill me now. Fill me with Thy hallowed presence, Jesus, come and fill me now.


[Verse 5] 
I am weakness, full of weakness, At Thy sacred feet I bow; Blest, divine, eternal Spirit, Come with power, and fill me now.


[Verse 6] 
Fill me now, fill me now, Jesus, come and fill me now. Fill me with Thy hallowed presence, Jesus, come and fill me now.
