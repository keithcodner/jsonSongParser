[Verse 1] 
Jesus, forgive me. Jesus, free me. Jesus, touch me. Jesus, fill me.


[Verse 2] 
I lift my head, lift my heart, Lift my soul to You. I give my life, give myself, Give it all to You.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, teach me. Jesus, lead me. Jesus, guide me. Jesus, use me. 


[Verse 4] 
I lift my head, lift my heart, Lift my soul to You. I give my life, give myself, Give it all to You.
