[Verse 1] 
The Church's one foundation Is Jesus Christ the Lord, And on that revelation Each one of us is called To taste His full salvation, To know His life within; A pure and holy nation To glorify the King.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah, how great You are, Reigning in glory, enthroned in power; Bright Morning Star, how great You are; Reigning in glory, enthroned in power.


[Verse 3] 
This time of preparation Eventually will yield The fruit of all His labours; His heart will be fulfilled. From every tribe and nation His people shall be known; Drawn to be His kingdom, Made out of living stones.


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah, how great You are, Reigning in glory, enthroned in power; Bright Morning Star, how great You are; Reigning in glory, enthroned in power.


[Verse 5] 
See Him and be radiant, Taste the Lord and know He wants to take us deeper, For what we are we sow; With streams of living water He longs to overflow, That out to all creation His glory He will show. 


[Verse 6] 
Hallelujah, how great You are, Reigning in glory, enthroned in power; Bright Morning Star, how great You are; Reigning in glory, enthroned in power.
