[Verse 1] 
O come, all ye faithful, Joyful and triumphant, O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; Come and behold Him, Born the King of angels;


[Verse 2] 
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!


[Verse 3] 
God of God, Light of light, Lo, He abhors not the virgin's womb; Very God, Begotten, not created:


[Verse 4] 
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!


[Verse 5] 
Sing, choirs of angels, Sing in exultation, Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above; Glory to God In the highest:


[Verse 6] 
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!


[Verse 7] 
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, Born this happy morning, Jesus, to Thee be glory given; Word of the Father Now in flesh appearing: 


[Verse 8] 
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!
