[Verse 1] 
Jesus, my desire, I turn towards Your ways. Hungry for Your truth, I'm here to seek Your face.


[Verse 2] 
But in my weakness I cry out to You, only You, To be my strength when I am weak, And do as You do.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, my desire, I turn towards Your ways. Hungry for Your truth, I'm here to seek Your face.


[Verse 4] 
How can I stay pure? Oh, how can I stay true? By living out Your word And dwelling in Your truth.


[Verse 5] 
But in my weakness I cry out to You, only You, To be my strength when I am weak, And do as You do.


[Verse 6] 
With You, it all seems so right. If the sun don't shine, There's light in Your eyes. With You, when mountains fall, I stand on the Rock And I am safe in Your arms When I'm with You, When I'm with You.


[Verse 7] 
With You, it all seems so right. If the sun don't shine, There's light in Your eyes. With You, when mountains fall, I stand on the Rock And I am safe in Your arms When I'm with You, When I'm with You. Just to be with You.
