[Verse 1] 
These thousand [E]hills roll ever on: footprints [B]of a Mighty God; They bring me [E]to my knees in [A]praise, amazing [E]love[B], amazing [E]grace.


[Verse 2] 
Was on a [E]hill my Savior died, a broken [B]heart and bleeding side; Hill of the [E]Skull, Mount Calva[A]ry, the blood He [E]shed[B], He shed for [E]me.


[Verse 3] 
When Heaven's [E]hills at last I roam, forever [B]settled in my home; I'll join the [E]saints around Your [A]throne, Your kingdom, [E]Lord[B], rolls ever [E]on.


[Verse 4] 
These thousand [E]hills roll ever on: ripples [B]of a coming storm; The morning [E]star precedes the [A]dawn, these thousand [E]hills[B] roll ever [E]on.
