[Verse 1] 
The day of the streams is over, The time of the river is here. (Repeat x4)


[Verse 2] 
I hear the sound of a mighty river, Of rushing water running free To every land, through every border, Flowing now across this earth.


[Verse 3] 
The day of the streams is over, The time of the river is here. (Repeat x4)


[Verse 4] 
There is a time I know is coming, When all God's people join as one; They will become a great awakening, Bringing life to all the world.


[Verse 5] 
The day of the streams is over, The time of the river is here. (Repeat x4)


[Verse 6] 
And the river is flowing, Getting wider and wider, Deeper and deeper As it flows from the throne; And the leaves on the trees Are for the healing of the nations, It's as clear as crystal, It's the water of life. 


[Verse 7] 
The day of the streams is over, The time of the river is here. (Repeat x4)
