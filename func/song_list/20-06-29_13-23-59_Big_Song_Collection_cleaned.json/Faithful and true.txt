[Verse 1] 
Faithful and true Are all Your ways; Your love for me will never fade away. Always the same, You never change; Your love for me will never fade away.


[Verse 2] 
Even in my hour of deepest need, You are always there to walk with me. You know my words before I speak; Lord, I know that You will never forsake me.
