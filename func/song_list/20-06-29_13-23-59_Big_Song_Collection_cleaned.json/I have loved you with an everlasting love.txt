[Verse 1] 
I have loved you with an everlasting love, And I have drawn you with My loving kindness. And I have loved you with an everlasting love, And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.


[Verse 2] 
Because God loved you and to keep His own, He brought you out with a mighty hand, He redeemed you from the devil's yoke. ||Oh, the Lord, He is the God And faithful is He. He'll keep His word and His covenant, Giving mercy and prosperity.


[Verse 3] 
I have loved you with an everlasting love, And I have drawn you with My loving kindness. And I have loved you with an everlasting love, And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.


[Verse 4] 
And casting all of Your cares on Him For He cares for you, There's a love dimension In the kingdom of God, It's sure to take you through. ||God commanded His love toward us, Christ died on a tree, Then He rose again, the living God, More than conquerors now are we. 


[Verse 5] 
I have loved you with an everlasting love, And I have drawn you with My loving kindness. And I have loved you with an everlasting love, And I have drawn you with My loving kindness.
