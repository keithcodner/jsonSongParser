[Verse 1] 
Hallelujah! Jesus is alive, Death has lost its victory And the grave has been denied; Jesus lives forever, He's alive, He's alive!


[Verse 2] 
He's the Alpha and Omega, The First and Last is He; The curse of sin is broken And we have perfect liberty. The Lamb of God has risen, He's alive, He's alive! 


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah! Jesus is alive, Death has lost its victory And the grave has been denied; Jesus lives forever, He's alive, He's alive! Hallelujah! Jesus is alive!
