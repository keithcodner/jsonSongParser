[Verse 1] 
Let our praise to You be as incense, Let our praise to You be as pillars of Your throne. Let our praise to You be as incense, As we come before You and worship You alone. ||As we see You in Your splendour, As we gaze upon Your majesty, As we join the hosts of angels And proclaim together Your holiness.


[Verse 2] 
Holy, holy, holy, Holy is the Lord. Holy, holy, holy, Holy is the Lord.
