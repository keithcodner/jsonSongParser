[Verse 1] 
Light a flame within my heart That's burning bright; Fan the fire of joy in me To set the world alight. Let my flame begin to spread, My life to glow; God of light may I reflect Your love to all I know.


[Verse 2] 
From heaven's splendour He comes to earth, While all the angels celebrate The goodness of His birth.


[Verse 3] 
Light a flame within my heart That's burning bright; Fan the fire of joy in me To set the world alight. Let my flame begin to spread, My life to glow; God of light may I reflect Your love to all I know.


[Verse 4] 
We too exalt You, Our glorious King; Jesus our Saviour Paid the price to take away our sin. 


[Verse 5] 
Light a flame within my heart That's burning bright; Fan the fire of joy in me To set the world alight. Let my flame begin to spread, My life to glow; God of light may I reflect Your love to all I know.
