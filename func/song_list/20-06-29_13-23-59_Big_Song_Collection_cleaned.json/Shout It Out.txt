I'm gonna raise my hands Gonna shout it out|| Gonna tell the world|What He's all about|| I'm gonna raise my voice Gonna shout it loud|| That the King is here|He's moving right now

C’mon, get up The King is here|| There's something happening|In the atmosphere!

Jump up, Jump up Jump up and shout it out|| The King is here Go tell the world about|| His love, His grace Spread the word around|| Jump up, Jump up Jump up and shout it out
