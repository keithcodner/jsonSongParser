[Verse 1] 
Who can compare with You, my Father; Loving and kind, faithful and true? When You forgive my heart that is broken, I gratefully sing my love to You.


[Verse 2] 
I worship You, I love You: All that I am Sings this song of praise.


[Verse 3] 
Here I will dwell in the arms of my Father, Knowing Your grace, hearing Your voice; Trusting Your word, feeling Your peace, Resting in You and in Your love.


[Verse 4] 
I worship You, I love You: All that I am Sings this song of praise.


[Verse 5] 
And I abide in You, I abide with You.


[Verse 6] 
I worship You, I love You: All that I am Sings this song of praise.
