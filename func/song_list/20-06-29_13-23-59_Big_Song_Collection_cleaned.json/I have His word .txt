[Verse 1] 
I have His word, His great and precious promises. He took my sin, His righteousness is mine. ||I am in Christ, Secure for all eternity: No power can sever me, nor cast me off From His abundant, free And sovereign love.


[Verse 2] 
I have His word, The Master Builder will succeed. The gates of hell, they never will prevail. ||Throughout the earth The joy of Jesus is His church; She is the mystery that stirred His heart, Drawing Him out of heaven To shed His blood.


[Verse 3] 
I have His word, A day is fixed when all the world In sudden awe the Son of God shall see. ||And in that day Our eyes shall see His majesty; What then of sufferings? What then of tears? We shall see perfectly When He appears!


[Verse 4] 
I have His word That every race shall reign with Him, We'll reach our home, the new Jerusalem. ||The Triune God Shall dwell with man eternally, More joys than eye has seen or ear has heard Wait for us certainly, I have His word.
