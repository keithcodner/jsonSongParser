[Verse 1] 
In You we live, Jesus, In You we move. In You we breathe, Jesus, In You we love. And we are Your body here, We are Your body here.


[Verse 2] 
Your touch - our hands, Your words - our voice, Your way - our feet, Your tears in our eyes, Your Spirit is here.


[Verse 3] 
You give - we share, You lead - we go, You send - we serve, You build and we grow. Your Spirit is here.


[Verse 4] 
Across the world, You're moving; The sound of prayer is growing stronger, From every tribe and nation Joining in one salvation song.


[Verse 5] 
You are the light that's dawning, You are the hope transforming all things; Freeing the whole creation To join in one salvation song, One song.
