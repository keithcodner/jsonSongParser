[Verse 1] 
Safe in the shadow of the Lord, Beneath His hand and power, I trust in Him, I trust in Him, My fortress and my tower.


[Verse 2] 
My hope is set on God alone, Though Satan spreads his snare, I trust in Him, I trust in Him, To keep me in His care.


[Verse 3] 
From fears and phantoms of the night, From foes about my way, I trust in Him, I trust in Him, By darkness as by day.


[Verse 4] 
His holy angels keep my feet Secure from every stone; I trust in Him, I trust in Him, And unafraid go on.


[Verse 5] 
Strong in the everlasting Name, And in my Father's care, I trust in Him, I trust in Him, Who hears and answers prayer.


[Verse 6] 
Safe in the shadow of the Lord, Possessed by love divine, I trust in Him, I trust in Him, And meet His love with mine.
