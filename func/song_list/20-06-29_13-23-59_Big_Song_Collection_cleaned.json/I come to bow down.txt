[Verse 1] 
I come to bow down, I come to hear You speak. I wait before You Where deep can call to deep.


[Verse 2] 
Be my life, be my all; Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
My heart will praise You; In praises You dwell. I long to be with You And come away with You.


[Verse 4] 
Be my life, be my all; Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Wonder of heaven, joy of my heart; Strength of my being, I love You. Rock of salvation, love of my life; God of all comfort, draw near.


[Verse 6] 
Be my life, be my all; Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.


[Verse 7] 
Heart and soul I seek You, Lord; Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.


[Verse 8] 
Be my life, be my all; Heart and soul I seek You, Lord.
