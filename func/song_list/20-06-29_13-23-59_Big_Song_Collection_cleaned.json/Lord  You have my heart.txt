[Verse 1] 
Lord, You have my heart, And I will search for Yours; Jesus, take my life and lead me on. Lord, You have my heart, And I will search for Yours; Let me be to You a sacrifice.


[Verse 2] 
And I will praise You, Lord. (Men) I will praise You, Lord. (Women) And I will sing of love come down. (Men) I will sing of love come down. (Women) And as You show Your face, (Men) Show Your face, (Women) We'll see Your glory here. (All)
