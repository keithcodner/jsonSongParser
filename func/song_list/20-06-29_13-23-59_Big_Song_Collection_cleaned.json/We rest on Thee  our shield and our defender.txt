[Verse 1] 
We rest on Thee, Our shield and our defender! We go not forth Alone against the foe; Strong in Thy strength, Safe in Thy keeping tender, We rest on Thee And in Thy name we go. || Strong in Thy strength, Safe in Thy keeping tender, We rest on Thee, And in Thy name we go.


[Verse 2] 
Yes, in Thy name, O Captain of salvation! In Thy dear name, All other names above, Jesus our Righteousness, Our sure Foundation, Our Prince of glory And our King of love. || Jesus our Righteousness, Our sure Foundation, Our Prince of glory And our King of love.


[Verse 3] 
We go in faith, Our own great weakness feeling, And needing more each day Thy grace to know: Yet from our hearts A song of triumph pealing; We rest on Thee, And in Thy name we go. || Yet from our hearts A song of triumph pealing; We rest on Thee, And in Thy name we go.


[Verse 4] 
We rest on Thee, Our Shield and our Defender! Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise; When passing through The gates of pearly splendour, Victors, we rest with Thee, Through endless days. || When passing through The gates of pearly splendour, Victors, we rest with Thee, Through endless days.
