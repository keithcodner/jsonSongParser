[Verse 1] 
Shine Your light on us That all may see Your goodness. Shine Your face on us That all may see Your glory.


[Verse 2] 
Answer me when I call. You are my only prayer. When darkness is all around I know You will be there.


[Verse 3] 
Shine Your light on us That all may see Your goodness. Shine Your face on us That all may see Your glory.


[Verse 4] 
Many are asking, Who can show us something real? Longing for hope Beyond the pain of what they feel. So I will go down on my knees and say:


[Verse 5] 
Shine Your light on us That all may see Your goodness. Shine Your face on us That all may see Your glory.


[Verse 6] 
I wanna be close to You, That my life would tell Your story. I wanna be one with You, Changed by the light of Your glory.
