[Verse 1] 
Hold me closer to you each day; May my love for You never fade. Keep my focus on all that's true; May I never lose sight of You.


[Verse 2] 
In my failure, in my success, If in sadness or happiness, Be the hope I am clinging to, For my heart belongs to You.


[Verse 3] 
Hold me closer to you each day; May my love for You never fade. Keep my focus on all that's true; May I never lose sight of You.


[Verse 4] 
You are only a breath away, Watching over me every day; In my heart I am filled with peace When I hear You speak to me.


[Verse 5] 
Hold me closer to you each day; May my love for You never fade. Keep my focus on all that's true; May I never lose sight of You.


[Verse 6] 
No one loves me the way You do, No one cares for me like You do. Feels like heaven has broken through; God, You know how I love You. 


[Verse 7] 
Hold me closer to you each day; May my love for You never fade. Keep my focus on all that's true; May I never lose sight of You.
