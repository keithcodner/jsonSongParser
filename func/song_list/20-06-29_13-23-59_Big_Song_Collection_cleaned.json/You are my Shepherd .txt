[Verse 1] 
You are my Shepherd, I have no needs. You lead me by peaceful streams, And You refresh my life. You hold my hand and You guide my steps, I could walk through the valley of death, And I won't be afraid.


[Verse 2] 
Because You are in control. You are in control. You are in control. You are in control.


[Verse 3] 
You cause everything to work together, You truly have a sovereign plan, And You know who I am, And You made who I am, And You love who I am.
