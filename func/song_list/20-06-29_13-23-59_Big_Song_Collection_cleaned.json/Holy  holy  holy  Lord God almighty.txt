[Verse 1] 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty! Early in the morning Our song shall rise to Thee: Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!


[Verse 2] 
Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee, Casting down their golden crowns Around the glassy sea; Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee, Who were, and are, and ever more shall be.


[Verse 3] 
Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee, Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see; Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee, Perfect in power, in love and purity.


[Verse 4] 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty! All Thy works shall praise Thy name In earth, and sky, and sea; Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
