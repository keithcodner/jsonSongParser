[Verse 1] 
The King is among us, His Spirit is here, Let's draw near and worship, Let songs fill the air.


[Verse 2] 
He looks down upon us, Delight in His face, Enjoying His children's love, Enthralled by our praise.


[Verse 3] 
For each child is special, Accepted and loved, A love gift from Jesus To His Father above.


[Verse 4] 
And now He is giving His gifts to us all, For no one is worthless And each one is called.


[Verse 5] 
The Spirit's anointing On all flesh comes down, And we shall be channels For works like His own.


[Verse 6] 
We come now believing Your promise of power, For we are Your people And this is Your hour.


[Verse 7] 
The King is among us, His Spirit is here, Let's draw near and worship, Let songs fill the air.
