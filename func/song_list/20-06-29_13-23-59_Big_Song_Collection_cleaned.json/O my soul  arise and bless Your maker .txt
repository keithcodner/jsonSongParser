[Verse 1] 
O my soul, arise and bless Your maker, For He is your Master and your Friend. Slow to wrath but rich in tender mercy: Worship the Saviour, Jesus. 


[Verse 2] 
King of grace, His love is overwhelming; Bread of Life, He's all I'll ever need, For His blood has purchased me forever: Bought at the cross of Jesus. 


[Verse 3] 
And I will sing for all my days Of heaven's love come down. Each breath I take will speak His praise Until He calls me home.


[Verse 4] 
When I wake, I know that He is with me; When I'm weak, I know that He is strong. Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on: Safe on the Rock of Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
Stir in me the songs that You are singing; Fill my gaze with things as yet unseen. Give me faith to move in works of power, Making me more like Jesus.


[Verse 6] 
And I will sing for all my days Of heaven's love come down. Each breath I take will speak His praise Until He calls me home.


[Verse 7] 
Then one day I'll see Him as He sees me, Face to face, the Lover and the loved; No more words, the longing will be over: There with my precious Jesus.


[Verse 8] 
And I will sing for all my days Of heaven's love come down. Each breath I take will speak His praise Until He calls me home.
