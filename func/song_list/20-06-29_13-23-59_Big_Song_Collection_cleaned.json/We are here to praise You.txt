[Verse 1] 
We are here to praise You, Lift our hearts and sing. We are here to give You The best that we can bring.


[Verse 2] 
And it is our love Rising from our hearts, Everything within us cries: 'Abba Father.' Help us now to give You Pleasure and delight, Heart and mind and will that say: 'I love You Lord.'
