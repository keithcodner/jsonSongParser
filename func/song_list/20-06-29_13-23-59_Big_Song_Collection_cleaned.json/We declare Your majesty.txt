[Verse 1] 
We declare Your majesty, We proclaim that Your name is exalted; For You reign magnificently, Rule victoriously, And Your power is shown Throughout the earth. ||And we exclaim our God is mighty, Lift up Your name, for You are holy. Sing it again, all honour and glory, In adoration we bow before Your throne.
