[Verse 1] 
We will seek Your face, Almighty God, Turn and pray for You to heal our land. Father, let revival start in us, Then every heart will know Your kingdom come. 


[Verse 2] 
Lifting up the name of the Lord In power and in unity, We will see the nations turn, Touching heaven, changing earth, Touching heaven, changing earth. 


[Verse 3] 
Never looking back, we'll run the race; Giving You our lives, we'll gain the prize. We will take the harvest given us, Though we sow in tears, we'll reap in joy.


[Verse 4] 
Lifting up the name of the Lord In power and in unity, We will see the nations turn, Touching heaven, changing earth, Touching heaven, changing earth. 


[Verse 5] 
Send revival, send revival, Send revival to us. Send revival, send revival, Send revival to us. 


[Verse 6] 
Lifting up the name of the Lord In power and in unity, We will see the nations turn, Touching heaven, changing earth, Touching heaven, changing earth.
