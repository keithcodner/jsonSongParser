[Verse 1] 
You said 'Ask and you will receive Whatever you need.' You said 'Pray, and I'll hear from heaven, And I'll heal your land.'


[Verse 2] 
You said Your glory will fill the earth, Like water the sea. You said 'Lift up your eyes, The harvest is here, The kingdom is here.'


[Verse 3] 
You said 'Ask, and I'll Give the nations to you.' O Lord, that's the cry of my heart. Distant shores and the Islands will see Your light as it rises on us.


[Verse 4] 
O Lord, I ask for the nations.


[Verse 5] 
You said 'Ask, and I'll Give the nations to you.' O Lord, that's the cry of my heart. Distant shores and the Islands will see Your light as it rises on us.
