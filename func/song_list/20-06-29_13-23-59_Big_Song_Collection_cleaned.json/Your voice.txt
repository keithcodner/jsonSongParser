Your voice is the voice that Commanded the universe to be. Your voice is the voice that Is speaking words of love to me: How can it be?

Awesome God, holy God, I worship You in wonder. Awesome God, holy God, As You draw near I'm humbled By Your majesty, and the mystery Of Your great love for me.

Your arms are the arms that Hung shining stars in deepest space. Your arms are the arms that Surround me in a warm embrace: Amazing grace.


[Verse 4] 
Awesome God, holy God, I worship You in wonder. Awesome God, holy God, As You draw near I'm humbled By Your majesty, and the mystery Of Your great love for me.
