[Verse 1] 
May my life declare the honour of Your name, Reveal the heart of Christ who came To light the darkest place With sacrificial love. (Last time) Sacrificial love.


[Verse 2] 
Cause me, Lord, to reach out in the Father's name, To glorify the Lamb once slain, To light the darkest place With sacrificial love.


[Verse 3] 
Teach me, Lord, to make my life as an offering, To tell the world that Jesus Christ is King, For the glory of God.
