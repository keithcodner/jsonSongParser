[Verse 1] 
I will cry mercy, I will cry mercy for this land, O God. I will cry justice, I will cry justice for this land, O God, For this land, O God.


[Verse 2] 
Let Your tears flow from my eyes; Let Your passion melt my heart of stone. Let Your beauty be seen in my life; Let Your heartbeat be my own. So I'll cry mercy for this nation, Let us see healing for the people, And I'll cry justice for this nation, O God.
