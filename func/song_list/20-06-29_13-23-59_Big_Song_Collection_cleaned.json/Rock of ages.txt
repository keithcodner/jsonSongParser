[Verse 1] 
Rock of ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee. Let the water and the blood From Your wounded side which flowed, Be of sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power. 


[Verse 2] 
My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock. My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock.


[Verse 3] 
Not the labours of my hands Can fulfil Your law's demands. Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears forever flow, All for sin could not atone. You must save and You alone. 


[Verse 4] 
My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock. My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock.


[Verse 5] 
Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Your cross I cling. Naked, come to You for dress, Helpless, look to You for grace. Foul, I to the fountain fly: Wash me, Saviour, or I die.


[Verse 6] 
My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock. My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock.


[Verse 7] 
While I draw this fleeting breath, When my eyelids close in death, When I soar to worlds unknown, See You on Your judgement throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee. 


[Verse 8] 
My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock. My Rock (my Rock), My Jesus, my Rock.
