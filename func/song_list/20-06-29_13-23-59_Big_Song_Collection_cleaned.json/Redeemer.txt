[Verse 1] 
Who taught the [G]sun where to [C]stand in the [D]morning? Who told the [G]ocean you cna [C]only come this [D]far? [C]Who showed the [B]moon where to hide 'til [C]evening? [G]Whose words alone can [C]catch a falling [D]star?


[Verse 2] 
Well, I kno[G]w my Re[C]deemer live[D]s. I kno[C]w my Redeeme[B]r live[C]s. All of creation tes[D]tify; His [B]life within me [C]cries. I know my Re[D]deemer [G]lives.[C][D]


[Verse 3] 
The very same God that spins things in orbit, He runs to the weary, the worn and the weak. And the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken, They conquered death to bring me victory.


[Verse 4] 
Now, I know my Redeemer lives. I know my Redeemer lives. Let all creation testify; Let this life within me cry. I know my Redeemer, He lives...


[Verse 5] 
To [C]take away my [D]shame. And He [Em]lives for[C]ever; I'll proc[D]laim That the [B]payment for my [C]sin Was the [B]precious life He [C]gave, But now [G]He's alive and [C]There's an empty gr[D]ave![D][E]


[Verse 6] 
Now, I [A]know my Re[D]deemer [E]lives. I [D]know my Re[C#]deemer [D]lives. Let all creation testif[E]y; Let this [C#]life within me [D]cry. I kno[D]w my Re[E]deemer, He [A]lives. I kno[A]w my Re[D]deemer, He [E]lives.
