[Verse 1] 
So freely, Flows the endless love You give to me; So freely, Not dependent on my part. As I am reaching out Reveal the love within Your heart, As I am reaching out Reveal the love within Your heart.


[Verse 2] 
Completely, That's the way You give Your love to me; Completely, Not dependent on my part. As I am reaching out Reveal the love within Your heart, As I am reaching out Reveal the love within Your heart.


[Verse 3] 
So easy, I receive the love You give to me; So easy, Not dependent on my part. Flowing out to me The love within Your heart, Flowing out to me The love within Your heart.
