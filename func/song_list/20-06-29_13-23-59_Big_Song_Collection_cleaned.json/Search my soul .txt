[Verse 1] 
Search my soul, and pierce my heart With a fire that burns from Your eyes. And drive me on to the reason for living, That is just for You, That is just for You.


[Verse 2] 
How long must I wait for Your coming? Come quickly, Lord, 'Cause You're the only answer. And drive me on to the reason for living, That is just for You, That is just for You.


[Verse 3] 
Let Your kingdom come, Let Your will be done, Let Your rain pour out on my life. Let Your kingdom come, Let Your will be done, Let Your rain drench my life and do Your will.


[Verse 4] 
Come and break the chains That hold me back, Lord, From dancing in Your light And being a fool for You. And I'm running back to the reason for living, That is just for You, That is just for You.


[Verse 5] 
Let Your kingdom come, Let Your will be done, Let Your rain pour out on my life. Let Your kingdom come, Let Your will be done, Let Your rain drench my life and do Your will.
