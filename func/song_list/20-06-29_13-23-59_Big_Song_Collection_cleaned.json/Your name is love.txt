[Verse 1] 
Your name is love, The love that went to the cross. Your name is peace, You've taken my sins away, And how I love all that You are, Your name is Jesus. 


[Verse 2] 
Your name is truth, The truth that sets me free. Your name is hope, Hope for eternity, And how I love all that You are, Your name is Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, Name above all names, I will ever more proclaim: 'Worthy is the Lamb To receive all power, To receive all praise.' 


[Verse 4] 
Your name is Lord, I gladly bow the knee. You are a friend, A friend of sinners like me, And how I love all that You are, Your name is Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus, Name above all names, I will ever more proclaim: 'Worthy is the Lamb To receive all power, To receive all praise.'
