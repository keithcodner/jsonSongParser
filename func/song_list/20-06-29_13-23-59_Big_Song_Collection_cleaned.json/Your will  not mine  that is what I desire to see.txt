[Verse 1] 
Your will, not mine, that is what I desire to see, Walking in righteousness, and holy liberty. Your life, not mine, that is what I desire to live, Forgiving others, as always You forgive.


[Verse 2] 
I bow before Your majesty, I fall before Your throne; I cannot understand Your love, But I claim it as my own. I rise and stand before You As a living sacrifice; I seek to do Your will, O God, For the rest of my life.


[Verse 3] 
Your voice, not mine, that is what I desire to hear; Speak in the stillness and whisper in my ear. Your mind, not mine, that is what I desire to have; To prophesy Your word, release the captive heart.


[Verse 4] 
I bow before Your majesty, I fall before Your throne; I cannot understand Your love, But I claim it as my own. I rise and stand before You As a living sacrifice; I seek to do Your will, O God, For the rest of my life.


[Verse 5] 
Your race, not mine, that is what I desire to run; To finish off the work that others have begun. Your work, not mine, that is what I desire to do; To serve Your purposes, and worship only You. 


[Verse 6] 
I bow before Your majesty, I fall before Your throne; I cannot understand Your love, But I claim it as my own. I rise and stand before You As a living sacrifice; I seek to do Your will, O God, For the rest of my life.
