[Verse 1] 
[D]Your mercy found me[G], Upon the broken road[Bm], And lifted me beyond[A] my failing[D],|| Into Your glory[G], My sin and shame is dissolved[Bm], And now forever Yours[A] I'll stand.


[Verse 2] 
In [D/F#]love ne[G]ver to end[A], To [Bm]call You more than Lord[D/F#], Gl[G]orious friend[Asus4].[A]


[Verse 3] 
So I throw[D] my life[G] upon all[Bm] You are, [A]‘Cause I know [D]You gave [G]it all for me,[Bm]||[A] And when al[D/F#]l else fades[G], My soul[A] will dance[Bm], with You[D/F#], Where the [G]love lasts for[Asus4]ever.[A][D][G][Bm][Asus4][A]
