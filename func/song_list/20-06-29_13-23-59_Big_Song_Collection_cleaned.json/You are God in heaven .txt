[Verse 1] 
You are God in heaven, And here am I on earth; So I'll let my words be few: Jesus, I am so in love with You.


[Verse 2] 
And I'll stand in awe of You, Yes, I'll stand in awe of You. And I'll let my words be few: Jesus, I am so in love with You.


[Verse 3] 
The simplest of all love songs I want to bring to You; So I'll let my words be few: Jesus, I am so in love with You.


[Verse 4] 
And I'll stand in awe of You, Yes, I'll stand in awe of You. And I'll let my words be few: Jesus, I am so in love with You.
