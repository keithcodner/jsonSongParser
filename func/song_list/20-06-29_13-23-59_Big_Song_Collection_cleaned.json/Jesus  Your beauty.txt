[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Your beauty is filling this temple. Jesus, Your fragrance is drawing me closer, And with every step I take You lead me into this holy place, And it washes me clean, For my eyes have seen Messiah.


[Verse 2] 
And I will jump into the holy river, I will lose myself to my Deliverer. I will jump into the holy river, I will lose myself to my Deliverer. In this holy place I can see Your face, Messiah.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, Your passion is filling this temple. Jesus, Your mercy is drawing me closer, And with every step I take You lead me into a world that aches, And I cannot rest till all eyes have seen Messiah.


[Verse 4] 
And I will jump into the holy river, I will lose myself to my Deliverer. I will jump into the holy river, I will lose myself to my Deliverer. In this holy place I can see Your face, Messiah.
