[Verse 1] 
I would rather be a doorkeeper in your house, Than have the many things this world could offer. All that I have gained I now count as loss, There's nothing that compares to knowing You.


[Verse 2] 
In Your presence is where I want to be, The place where You reveal Your grace and glory. Your presence brings me to my knees, I bow down and declare that You are holy.


[Verse 3] 
I would rather have one day in Your courts, O Lord, Than have a thousand days somewhere else. You are my sun and shield, No good thing will you withhold, For blessed are the ones who trust in You. 


[Verse 4] 
In Your presence is where I want to be, The place where You reveal Your grace and glory. Your presence brings me to my knees, I bow down and declare that You are holy.
