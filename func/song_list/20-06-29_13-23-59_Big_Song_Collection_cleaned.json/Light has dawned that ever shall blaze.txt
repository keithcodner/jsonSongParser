[Verse 1] 
Light has dawned that ever shall blaze; Darkness flees away. Christ the light has shone in our hearts, Turning night to day. ||We proclaim Him King of kings, We lift high His name. Heaven and earth shall bow at His feet When He comes to reign.


[Verse 2] 
Saviour of the world is He, Heaven's King come down. Judgement, love and mercy meet At His thorny crown.


[Verse 3] 
Light has dawned that ever shall blaze; Darkness flees away. Christ the light has shone in our hearts, Turning night to day. ||We proclaim Him King of kings, We lift high His name. Heaven and earth shall bow at His feet When He comes to reign.


[Verse 4] 
Life has sprung from hearts of stone, By the Spirit's breath. Hell shall let her captives go, Life has conquered death.


[Verse 5] 
Light has dawned that ever shall blaze; Darkness flees away. Christ the light has shone in our hearts, Turning night to day. ||We proclaim Him King of kings, We lift high His name. Heaven and earth shall bow at His feet When He comes to reign.


[Verse 6] 
Blood has flowed that cleanses from sin, God His love has proved. Men may mock and demons may rage, We shall not be moved! 


[Verse 7] 
Light has dawned that ever shall blaze; Darkness flees away. Christ the light has shone in our hearts, Turning night to day. ||We proclaim Him King of kings, We lift high His name. Heaven and earth shall bow at His feet When He comes to reign.
