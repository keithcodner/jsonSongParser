[Verse 1] 
You've put a new song in my mouth; It is a hymn of praise to You. Justice and mercy are its theme, And I will live it back to You.


[Verse 2] 
The kind of fast You've chosen, Lord, It must reach out To broken lives and to the poor: So change me, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
You've put a new song in my mouth; It is a hymn of praise to You. Justice and mercy are its theme, And I will live it back to You.


[Verse 4] 
I know You are the orphan's hope, I know You are the widow's song; You're Father where no father lives, And to the lonely You're a friend. O Lord, You're showing me what's on Your heart.


[Verse 5] 
You've put a new song in my mouth; It is a hymn of praise to You. Justice and mercy are its theme, And I will live it back to You.


[Verse 6] 
Lord, I won't bring an empty song; It's meaningless Without compassion in my life, And holiness.


[Verse 7] 
You've put a new song in my mouth; It is a hymn of praise to You. Justice and mercy are its theme, And I will live it back to You.
