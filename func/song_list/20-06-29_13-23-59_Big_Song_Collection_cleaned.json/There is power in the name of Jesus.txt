[Verse 1] 
There is power in the name of Jesus; We believe in His name. We have called on the name of Jesus; We are saved! We are saved! At His name the demons flee. At His name captives are freed. For there is no other name that is higher Than Jesus!


[Verse 2] 
There is power in the name of Jesus, Like a sword in our hands. We declare in the name of Jesus, We shall stand! We shall stand! At His name God's enemies Shall be crushed beneath our feet. For there is no other name that is higher Than Jesus!
