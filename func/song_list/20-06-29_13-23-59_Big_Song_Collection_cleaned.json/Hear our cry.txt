[Verse 1] 
Hear our cry for the nations, O Lord of the heavens. Hear our prayer for this fallen world. Come by Your Spirit, Pour out Your mercy On this earth. 


[Verse 2] 
Hear our cry for this nation, O Lord of the heavens. Hear our prayer as we gather here. Come by Your Spirit, Pour out Your mercy, Heal this land.
