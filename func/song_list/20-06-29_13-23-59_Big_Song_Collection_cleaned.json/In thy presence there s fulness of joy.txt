[Verse 1] 
In thy presence there's fulness of joy, Fulness of joy, fulness of joy. At Thy right hand are pleasures forever, Pleasures forever more.


[Verse 2] 
I keep the Lord before me, I shall not be moved. My heart is glad and my soul rejoices; I shall dwell in safety.


[Verse 3] 
And in Thy presence there's fulness of joy, Fulness of joy, fulness of joy. At Thy right hand are pleasures forever, Pleasures forever more.
