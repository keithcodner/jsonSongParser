[Verse 1] 
I don't know why, I can't see how Your precious blood could cleanse me now; When all this time I've lived a lie, With no excuse, no alibi.


[Verse 2] 
All I know is I find mercy; All my shame You take from me. All I know, Your cross has power, And the blood You shed cleanses me.


[Verse 3] 
It's way beyond what I can see, How anyone could die for me. So undeserved, this precious grace; You've won my heart, I'll seek Your face.


[Verse 4] 
All I know is I find mercy; All my shame You take from me. All I know, Your cross has power, And the blood You shed cleanses me.
