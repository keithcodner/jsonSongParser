[Verse 1] 
See His glory, see His glory, See His glory now appear. See His glory, see His glory, See His glory now appear. God of light, Holiness and truth, power and might, See His glory, see it now appear.


[Verse 2] 
Now we declare our God is good And His mercies endure forever. Now we declare our God is good, And His mercies endure forever.
