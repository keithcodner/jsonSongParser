[Verse 1] 
Here I wait beneath the cross, Resting in the presence of Your love. Here I wait to know Your heart, As I worship You in spirit and in truth.


[Verse 2] 
For You are my God, You are my King, You reveal deep within to my very soul. For You alone are


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, there's no other name, Jesus, eternally the same, Jesus, the King of kings. Jesus, Redeemer, Saviour, Friend, Jesus, faithful till the end, Jesus, the King of kings.


[Verse 4] 
Here I come to give my all, My hands reach up in holy praise to You. Here I cast all chains aside To worship You in spirit and in truth.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus, there's no other name, Jesus, eternally the same, Jesus, the King of kings. Jesus, Redeemer, Saviour, Friend, Jesus, faithful till the end, Jesus, the King of kings.
