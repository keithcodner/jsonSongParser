[Verse 1] 
O heaven, is in my heart. O, heaven is in my heart.

The kingdom of our God is here, (Leader) Heaven is in my heart. (All) The presence of His majesty, (Leader) Heaven is in my heart. (All) And in His presence joy abounds, (Leader) Heaven is in my heart. (All) The light of holiness surrounds, (Leader) Heaven is in my heart. (All)


[Verse 3] 
O heaven, is in my heart. O, heaven is in my heart.


[Verse 4] 
His precious life on me He spent, (All) Heaven is in my heart. To give me life without an end, Heaven is in my heart. In Christ is all my confidence, Heaven is in my heart. The hope of my inheritance, Heaven is in my heart.

O heaven, is in my heart. O, heaven is in my heart.


[Verse 6] 
We are a temple for His throne, (Women) Heaven is in my heart. (All) And Christ is the foundation stone, (Women) Heaven is in my heart. (All) He will return to take us home, (Women) Heaven is in my heart. (All) The Spirit and the Bride say 'Come!' (Women) Heaven is in my heart.
