[Verse 1] 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Christ is in you, The hope of glory In our hearts. He lives! He lives! His breath is in you, Arise a mighty army, We arise.


[Verse 2] 
Now is the time for us To march upon the land, Into our hands He will give the ground we claim. He rides in majesty To lead us into victory, The world shall see That Christ is Lord!


[Verse 3] 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Christ is in you, The hope of glory In our hearts. He lives! He lives! His breath is in you, Arise a mighty army, We arise.


[Verse 4] 
God is at work in us His purpose to perform, Building a kingdom Of power not of words, Where things impossible, By faith shall be made possible; Let's give the glory To Him now.


[Verse 5] 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Christ is in you, The hope of glory In our hearts. He lives! He lives! His breath is in you, Arise a mighty army, We arise.


[Verse 6] 
Though we are weak, His grace Is everything we need; We're made of clay But this treasure is within. He turns our weaknesses Into His opportunities, So that the glory Goes to Him. 


[Verse 7] 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Christ is in you, The hope of glory In our hearts. He lives! He lives! His breath is in you, Arise a mighty army, We arise.
