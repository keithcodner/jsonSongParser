[Verse 1] 
You led me to the cross, And I saw Your face of mercy In that place of love. ||You opened up my eyes To believe Your sweet salvation, Where I'd been so blind. Now that I'm living in Your all-forgiving love, My every road leads to the cross.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, keep me near the cross, I won't forget the love You've shown. Saviour, teach me of the cross, I won't forget the love, I won't forget the love You've shown.


[Verse 3] 
And there's an empty tomb, That tells me of Your resurrection And my life in You. ||The stone lies rolled away, Nothing but those folded grave clothes Where Your body lay. Now that I'm living as a risen child of God, My every road leads to the cross.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, keep me near the cross, I won't forget the love You've shown. Saviour, teach me of the cross, I won't forget the love, I won't forget the love You've shown.
