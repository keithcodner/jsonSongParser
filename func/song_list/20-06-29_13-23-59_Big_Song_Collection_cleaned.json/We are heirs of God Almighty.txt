[Verse 1] 
We are heirs of God Almighty, Apple of the Father's eye; Free, forgiven, loved, accepted, Clothed in righteousness divine. Chosen to be pure and blameless From before the world began; Grace for every situation, Sheltered in the Father's hand.


[Verse 2] 
We have Christ at work within us, Shaping us to be like Him; Resurrection power sustaining Freedom from the snares of sin. Saying no to flesh desires, Saying yes to righteous ways; Filled with passion and with power, Lights that burn in darkened days.


[Verse 3] 
We've the Spirit without measure, Helper, Comforter and Guide; One who brings the gifts of heaven, One who comes to walk beside. Taste of heaven's endless pleasure, Guarantee of what's to come; Causing fruit to grow in action, Bringing glory to the Son.
