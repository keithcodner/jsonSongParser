[Verse 1] 
You shaped the heavens and the earth, Revealed Your splendour. You spoke Your life into our hearts, So we belong to You.


[Verse 2] 
You are the Maker of all things, First and the Last; Creation sings praise to You, God. You're reigning in glory, Ancient of Days; Your people sing praise to You, God.


[Verse 3] 
Creator God, in You all things Now hold together, Working Your wonders day by day, You'll reign forever.


[Verse 4] 
You are the Maker of all things, First and the Last; Creation sings praise to You, God. You're reigning in glory, Ancient of Days; Your people sing praise to You, God.


[Verse 5] 
And earth joins with heaven Declaring Your glory; Proclaiming the works of Your hands. (Repeat)
