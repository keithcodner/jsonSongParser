[Verse 1] 
What wisdom once devised the plan Where all our sin and pride Was placed upon the perfect Lamb Who suffered, bled and died? The wisdom of a sovereign God Whose greatness will be shown, When those who crucified Your Son Rejoice around Your throne.


[Verse 2] 
And oh, the glory of the cross, That You would send Your Son for us. I gladly count my life as loss That I might come to know The glory of, the glory of the cross.


[Verse 3] 
What righteousness was there revealed That sets the guilty free, That justifies ungodly men And calls the filthy clean? A righteousness that proved to all Your justice has been met, And holy wrath is satisfied Through one atoning death.


[Verse 4] 
And oh, the glory of the cross, That You would send Your Son for us. I gladly count my life as loss That I might come to know The glory of, the glory of the cross.


[Verse 5] 
What mercy now has been proclaimed For those who would believe? A love incomprehensible, Our minds could not conceive. A mercy that forgives my sin And makes me like Your Son. And now I'm loved forevermore, Because of what You've done. 


[Verse 6] 
And oh, the glory of the cross, That You would send Your Son for us. I gladly count my life as loss That I might come to know The glory of, the glory of the cross.
