[Verse 1] 
Strong and [G]mighty, strong to [G]save us Like a [G]fortress never [D]failing. Strong in [G]battle, strong in [G]kindness, When we [G]stray, Lord, You're strong to [D]find us.


[Verse 2] 
When the [Em]winds come hard against us, You are [D]steadfast, You are true. When the [Em]ground beneath us trembles, Your foundation never [D]moves.


[Verse 3] 
Strong [G]tower, high and [C]glorious. Strong [G]tower, mighty in [Dsus]love.[D] Our [G]refuge, our [C]defender, Strong [G]tower, [D]Lord a[G]bove. 


[Verse 4] 
Strong to [G]lead us through the [G]shadows. Strong to [G]carry all our [D]sorrows.


[Verse 5] 
When the[Em] enemy surrounds us, Closing [D]in as darkness falls, Though his [Em]armies rage against us, They can [D]never scale these walls.


[Verse 6] 
[Em]You are my [C]shelter, my [D]shield. You are the [Em]home I [C]could never [D]deserve. Here I will [C]serve, e[G]ver under Your [D]gaze. Here I will [C]serve, ever [G]singing Your [D]praise.[Dsus]


[Verse 7] 
Strong [C]tower, [D]Lord a[G]bove. Strong [C]tower, [D]Lord a[G]bove.
