[Verse 1] 
We're [C]looking to Your promise of [F]old, That if we [C]pray and humble our[F]selves, You will [Am]come and heal our [Dm7]land, You will [C]come, You will [F]come.[(C)]


[Verse 2] 
We're [C]looking to the promise You [F]made, That if we [C]turn and look to Your [F]face, You will [Am]come and heal our [Dm7]land, You will [C]come, You will [F]come to [C]us.


[Verse 3] 
[(C)]Lord, [G/B]send re[Am]vival, [F]start with [C]me. For [G/B]I am [Am]one of [F]unclean [C]lips, And my [F]eyes have seen the [C]King; Your [F]glory I have [C]glimpsed, Send [F]re[C/E]vival [Dm]start [Fsus2]with [C]me.
