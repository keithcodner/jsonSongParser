[Verse 1] 
When words are not enough To tell of all You've done, I bow the knee, let silence speak, And gaze upon Your majesty. 


[Verse 2] 
These songs could not convey A picture of Your love; And knowing this, my life I give To You, an offering of praise.


[Verse 3] 
And I surrender all, And I surrender all; Unveil my heart to see The wonder of Your worth, As I surrender all, As I surrender all. 


[Verse 4] 
The worship You require Is brokenness of heart; So here I stand with open hands, Surrendered to Your love and power.


[Verse 5] 
And I surrender all, And I surrender all; Unveil my heart to see The wonder of Your worth, As I surrender all, As I surrender all.
