[Verse 1] 
Father God, we worship You, Make us part of all You do. As You move among us now We worship You.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus King, we worship You, Help us listen now to You. As You move among us now We worship You.


[Verse 3] 
Spirit pure, we worship You, With Your fire our zeal renew. As You move among us now We worship You.
