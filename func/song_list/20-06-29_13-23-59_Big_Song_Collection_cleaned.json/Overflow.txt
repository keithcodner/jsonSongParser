[Verse 1] 
I've got a story to tell And I am learning You've got a story as well Flowing through us making us who we are|| And just like a river that runs The story of Jesus comes Into our hearts so that we can know A love so great it will overflow 


[Verse 2] 
Let the river run wild and free The river of your love for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow 


[Verse 3] 
This is a time to be real This is a time for courage Time for going deeper still For letting go into His will 


[Verse 4] 
Let the river run wild and free The river of your love for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow 


[Verse 5] 
This is a time to be real This is a time for courage Time for going deeper still For letting go into His will 


[Verse 6] 
Overflow let me overflow Fill my heart and my soul Let me overflow Let me overflow Fill my heart and my soul 'til it overflows


[Verse 7] 
Let the river run wild and free The river of your love for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow 


[Verse 8] 
Guys: Let the river run wild and free The river of your love for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow Let the river run wild and free The river of your grace for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow Girls: Overflow let me overflow Fill my heart and my soul Let me overflow Let me overflow Fill my heart and my soul


[Verse 9] 
Let the river run wild and free The river of your love for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow 


[Verse 10] 
This is a time to be real This is a time for courage Time for going deeper still For letting go into His will 


[Verse 11] 
Let the river run wild and free The river of your grace for me Fill my heart and my soul till I overflow
