[Verse 1] 
When I survey The wondrous cross On which the Prince Of glory died, My richest gain I count but loss, And pour contempt On all my pride.


[Verse 2] 
Forbid it, Lord, That I should boast, Save in the death Of Christ my God: All the vain things That charm me most, I sacrifice them To His blood.


[Verse 3] 
See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love Flow mingled down: Did e'er such love And sorrow meet, Or thorns compose So rich a crown?


[Verse 4] 
Were the whole realm Of Nature mine, That were an offering Far too small; Love so amazing, So divine, Demands my soul, My life, my all!
