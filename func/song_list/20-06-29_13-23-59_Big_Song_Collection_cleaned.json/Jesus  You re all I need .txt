[Verse 1] 
Jesus, You're all I need, You're all I need. Now I give my life to You alone, You are all I need. Jesus, You're all I need, You're all I need. Lord, You gave Yourself so I could live, You are all I need.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, You purchased my salvation, And wiped away my tears; Now I drink Your living water, And I'll never thirst again. For You alone are holy, I'll worship at Your throne; And You will reign forever, Holy is the Lord.
