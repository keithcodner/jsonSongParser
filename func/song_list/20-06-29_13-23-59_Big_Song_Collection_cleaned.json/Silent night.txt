[Verse 1] 
Silent night, holy night! Sleeps the world; hid from sight, Mary and Joseph in stable bare Watch o'er the Child beloved and fair, Sleeping in heavenly rest, Sleeping in heavenly rest.


[Verse 2] 
Silent night, holy night! Shepherds first saw the light, Heard resounding clear and long, Far and near, the angel-song: 'Christ the Redeemer is here, Christ the Redeemer is here.'


[Verse 3] 
Silent night, holy night! Son of God, O how bright Love is smiling from Thy face! Strikes for us now the hour of grace, Saviour, since Thou art born, Saviour, since Thou art born.
