[Verse 1] 
I hear the sound of a generation Lifting their voice, rising as one Now is the time for Your Name to be lifted high


[Verse 2] 
Forever weâ€™ll sing of the things You have Done Nothing compares to Your power and love Now is the time for Your Name to be lifted high


[Verse 3] 
We will lift Your Name Higher than any name

Forever we will sing Glory to the King Forever, forever

The name above all names We will shout Your praise Forever, forever


[Verse 6] 
We will lift Your Name Higher than any name King of kings Forever we will sing


[Verse 7] 
Forever, Forever Forever we will shout Your name
