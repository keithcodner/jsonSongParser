[Verse 1] 
We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world. We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world.


[Verse 2] 
So wave those flags of justice Over the nations, And hit those drums of peace Among the peoples. We hear the sound of history in the making, Let God's love run around the earth And bring freedom!


[Verse 3] 
We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world. We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world.


[Verse 4] 
So hold each other's hands Across the oceans, And play those chords of peace Among the peoples. We hear the sound of reconciliation: Let God's love dance around the earth And bring freedom!


[Verse 5] 
We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world. We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world.


[Verse 6] 
And we wanna change this world As we live out holy lives. And we wanna change this world As You wash our motives clean. (Repeat) Oh, wash us clean! 


[Verse 7] 
We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world. We wanna change this world, We wanna change this world.
