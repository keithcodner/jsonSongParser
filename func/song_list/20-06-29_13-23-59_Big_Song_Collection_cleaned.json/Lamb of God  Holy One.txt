[Verse 1] 
Lamb of God, Holy One, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Lifted up willingly to die, That I the guilty one may know The blood once shed, still freely flowing, Still cleansing, still healing.


[Verse 2] 
I exalt You, Jesus my sacrifice; I exalt You, My Redeemer and my Lord. I exalt You, Worthy Lamb of God, And in honour I bow down before Your throne.
