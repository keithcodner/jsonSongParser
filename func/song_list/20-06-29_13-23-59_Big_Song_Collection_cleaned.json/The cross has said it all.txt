[Verse 1] 
The cross has said it all, The cross has said it all. I can't deny what You have shown, The cross speaks of a God of love; There displayed for all to see, Jesus Christ, our only hope, A message of the Father's heart: 'Come, my children, come on home.'


[Verse 2] 
As high as the heavens are above the earth, So high is the measure of Your great love; As far as the east is from the west, So far have You taken our sins from us. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
The cross has said it all, The cross has said it all. I never recognised Your touch Until I met You at the cross; We are fallen, dust to dust, How could You do this for us? Son of God shed precious blood: Who can comprehend this love?


[Verse 4] 
As high as the heavens are above the earth, So high is the measure of Your great love; As far as the east is from the west, So far have You taken our sins from us. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
How high, how wide, how deep; How high, how wide, how deep; How high, how wide, how deep; How high! 


[Verse 6] 
As high as the heavens are above the earth, So high is the measure of Your great love; As far as the east is from the west, So far have You taken our sins from us. (Repeat)
