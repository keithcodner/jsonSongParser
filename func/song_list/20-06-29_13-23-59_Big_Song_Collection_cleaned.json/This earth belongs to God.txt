[Verse 1] 
This earth belongs to God, The world, its wealth, and all its people; He formed the waters wide And fashioned every sea and shore. ||Who may go up the hill of the Lord And stand in the place of holiness? Only the one whose heart is pure, Whose hands and lips are clean.


[Verse 2] 
Lift high your heads, you gates, Rise up, you everlasting doors, As here now the King of glory Enters into full command. ||Who is the King, this King of glory? Where is the throne He comes to claim? Christ is the King, the Lord of glory, Fresh from His victory.


[Verse 3] 
Lift high your heads, you gates, And fling wide open the ancient doors, For here the King of glory Takes universal power. ||Who is this king, this King of glory, What is the power by which He reigns? Christ is the King, His cross of glory, And by love He rules.


[Verse 4] 
All glory be to God The Father, Son and Holy Spirit; From ages past it was, Is now, and ever more shall be.
