[Verse 1] 
Worthy, O worthy are You, Lord, Worthy to be thanked and praised And worshipped and adored. Worthy, O worthy are You, Lord, Worthy to be thanked and praised And worshipped and adored.


[Verse 2] 
Singing, Hallelujah, Lamb upon the throne, We worship and adore You, make Your glory known. Hallelujah, glory to the King: You're more than a conqueror, You're Lord of everything.
