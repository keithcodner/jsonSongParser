[Verse 1] 
There's a pageant of triumph in glory, As Jesus the King takes His throne. The shame of the cross is exchanged for a crown, And heaven applauds the King. ||The Son has the Father's approval, He perfectly followed the plan To suffer and die for the sins of the world, He poured out His love for our shame. 


[Verse 2] 
Let God arise with shouts of joy, With songs of praise and trumpet sound; Let music play and hearts be free, Let God arise!


[Verse 3] 
Death could not keep Him in prison, He burst through the shackles of hell; He settled the score with the evil one, And heaven applauds the King. ||The fullness of Christ is my treasure, I've cast off the past with its shame. The power of the Father has raised me to life, I'm a son, I'm forgiven and free.


[Verse 4] 
Let God arise with shouts of joy, With songs of praise and trumpet sound; Let music play and hearts be free, Let God arise!
