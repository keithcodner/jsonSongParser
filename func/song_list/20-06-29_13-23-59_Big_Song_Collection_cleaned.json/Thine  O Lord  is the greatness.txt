[Verse 1] 
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, And the power and the glory. Thine, O Lord, is the victory, And majesty, and majesty.


[Verse 2] 
All that is in heaven and earth is Thine, Thou art exalted as head over all!


[Verse 3] 
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, And the power and the glory. Thine, O Lord, is the victory, And majesty, and majesty.


[Verse 4] 
In Thy hand is power and might to make great, In Thy hand is power to give strength to all!


[Verse 5] 
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, And the power and the glory. Thine, O Lord, is the victory, And majesty, and majesty.


[Verse 6] 
Now is come salvation and power and might, For the kingdom of our God has been given to His Christ!
