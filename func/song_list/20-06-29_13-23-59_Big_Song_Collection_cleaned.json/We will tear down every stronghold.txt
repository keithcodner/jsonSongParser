[Verse 1] 
We will tear down every stronghold Through the power of His word. We will seek to bring His kingdom in, Make a way for His return.


[Verse 2] 
We will tell of His salvation, For the church of Christ is called To bring healing to the nations, See His righteousness restored.


[Verse 3] 
Satan is defeated, Christ has overcome, Seated at the Father's hand, Lord, on earth may Your will now be done.
