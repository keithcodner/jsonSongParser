[Verse 1] 
Yours is the kingdom, The power and the glory, Forever and ever, Forever and ever, Amen! (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
A trumpet blast will herald The day of Your return: Your glory and Your splendour Will be seen in all the earth!


[Verse 3] 
Yours is the kingdom, The power and the glory, Forever and ever, Forever and ever, Amen! (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
And oh, what a day, Oh, what a day that will be, When the earth joins with heaven In worship and praise to Jesus!


[Verse 5] 
Yours is the kingdom, The power and the glory, Forever and ever, Forever and ever, Amen! (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
The time is drawing nearer, I believe it's coming soon, When we will rise to greet You As a bride to meet her groom.


[Verse 7] 
Yours is the kingdom, The power and the glory, Forever and ever, Forever and ever, Amen! (Repeat)
