[Verse 1] 
Merciful God and Father, Loving us like no other, Hear our prayer, the cry of our hearts, As we come to You. We acknowledge our transgressions, We confess to You our sins; Show us mercy and compassion, Touch our lives With Your healing grace again.


[Verse 2] 
Release us from the past, As we seek Your face. Wash us free at last, We receive Your love, We receive Your healing grace. We receive Your love, We receive Your healing grace.
