[Verse 1] 
May my eyes see more of You, Lord; May my heart just beat with Yours. May my hope be in Your goodness, May my life be pure. And every day my cry is just the same: Make me like Jesus, Lord, I pray. 


[Verse 2] 
Because You've captured my heart, You have captured my heart. King of love, and King of glory, Author of creation's story, I delight in You, and now and forever. ||You have captured my heart, You have captured my heart. I delight in You, You've captured my heart. 


[Verse 3] 
Because You've captured my heart, You have captured my heart. In Your throne room there will be No hiding place in purity, A life laid bare for all to see, O God, make me holy. ||You have captured my heart, You have captured my heart. I delight in You, You've captured my heart.
