[Verse 1] 
[G]City sidewalks, busy sidewalks Dressed in [C]Holiday style In the [D7]air there's a feeling of [G]Christmas Children laughing, people passing Meeting [C]smile after smile And on [D7]every street corner you [G]hear [G]Silver bells, [C]silver bells [D]It's Christmas-time in the [G]city [G]Ring-a-ling, [C]hear them ring [D]Soon it will be Christmas [G]day.


[Verse 2] 
[G]Strings of street lights, even stop lights Blink a [C]bright red and green As the [D7]shoppers run home with their [G]treasures [G]Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch This is [C]Santa's big scene And [D7]above all the bustle you [G]hear... [G]Silver bells, [C]silver bells [D]It's Christmas-time in the [G]city [G]Ring-a-ling, [C]hear them ring [D]Soon it will be Christmas [G]day
