[Verse 1] 
Falling, moving closer, Deep into You. Feasting, drinking my fill, Tasting of You. 


[Verse 2] 
Waiting, listening, hoping Here's where You are. Craving, calling Your name, I need You more. 


[Verse 3] 
I will hold on, Hold through the fire, Cling through the rain, I long to hear You. I need You here, All that You are, Only Your touch Will satisfy me.
