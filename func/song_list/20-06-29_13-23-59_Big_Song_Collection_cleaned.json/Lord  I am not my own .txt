[Verse 1] 
Lord, I am not my own, No longer my own, Living now for You, And everything I think, All I say and do Is for You, my Lord. 


[Verse 2] 
Now taking up the cross, Walking on Your paths, Holding out Your truth, Running in this race, Bowing every day, All for You, my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
And what I have vowed I will make good. Every promise made Will be fulfilled, Till the day I die, Every day I live Is for You, is for You, is for You, Is for You, is for You, is for You. 


[Verse 4] 
Earth has nothing I desire That lives outside of You, I'm consumed with You. Treasures have no hold, Nothing else will do, Only You, my Lord.


[Verse 5] 
And what I have vowed I will make good. Every promise made Will be fulfilled, Till the day I die, Every day I live Is for You, is for You, is for You, Is for You, is for You, is for You.
