[Verse 1] 
I count as nothing every earthly treasure, Jesus; What You have shown me is that You are the source of my life. So what else can I do But stay here?


[Verse 2] 
Why would I look for Any worldly pleasure, Jesus, When I have all things in You? And just a heartbeat away. So what else can I do But stay here with You?


[Verse 3] 
You're all that I need, You're all that I need, So here I'll stay And give my praise to You.
