[Verse 1] 
O Lord, You're beautiful, Your face is all I seek, For when Your eyes are on this child, Your grace abounds to me.


[Verse 2] 
O Lord, please light the fire That once burned bright and clear, Replace the lamp of my first love That burns with holy fear!


[Verse 3] 
I wanna take Your word And shine it all around, But first help me just to live it, Lord! And when I'm doing well, Help me to never seek a crown, For my reward is giving glory to You.
