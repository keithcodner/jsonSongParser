[Verse 1] 
In this stillness I will worship, Love You, Jesus, I turn toward to kiss Your face. I come running, thirsting, longing For You, Jesus, In the quiet of this place. Draw me closer to You, Jesus, I would be with You.


[Verse 2] 
Risen Healer, conquering Saviour, King of kings and Prince of Peace. Faithful Father, my Friend forever, I will live to bring You praise. 


[Verse 3] 
In Your presence I will bow down, Join with the angels Singing 'Holy is Your name'. In this moment heaven's fragrance Touches earth and I can feel Your kingdom come. Draw me closer to You, Jesus, I would be with You.


[Verse 4] 
Risen Healer, conquering Saviour, King of kings and Prince of Peace. Faithful Father, my Friend forever, I will live to bring You praise.
