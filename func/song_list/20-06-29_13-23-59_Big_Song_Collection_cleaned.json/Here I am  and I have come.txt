[Verse 1] 
Here I am, and I have come To thank You, Lord, for all You've done; Thank You, Lord. You paid the price at Calvary, You shed Your blood, You set me free; Thank You, Lord. ||No greater love was ever shown, No better life ever was laid down.


[Verse 2] 
And I will always love Your name; And I will always sing Your praise. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
You took my sin, You took my shame, You drank my cup, You bore my pain; Thank You, Lord. You broke the curse, You broke the chains, In victory from death You rose again; Thank You, Lord. ||And not by works, but by Your grace You clothe me now in Your righteousness.


[Verse 4] 
And I will always love Your name; And I will always sing Your praise. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
You bid me come, You make me whole, You give me peace, You restore my soul; Thank You, Lord. You fill me up, and when I'm full, You give me more till I overflow; Thank You, Lord. ||You're making me to be like You, To do the works of the Father, too. 


[Verse 6] 
And I will always love Your name; And I will always sing Your praise. (Repeat)
