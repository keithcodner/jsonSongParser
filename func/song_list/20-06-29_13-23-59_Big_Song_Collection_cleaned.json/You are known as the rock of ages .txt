[Verse 1] 
You are known as the rock of ages, And the holy Ancient of Days. Men of old who saw Your face, Lord, Would not ever be the same. When You came as God incarnate, Walked this earth, Your glory veiled, Those who knew You, and who loved You Would not ever be the same.


[Verse 2] 
For I have seen You, Rock of Ages, And I will never be the same. Oh, I love You, Rock of Ages, And I will always love Your name.


[Verse 3] 
Will You hide me, Rock of Ages, In Your secret place of peace? Can I feel Your burning glory? Can I hear You when You speak? Will You chasten me and mould me? Will You hold me in Your will? Oh to know You, love and serve You And Your purposes fulfil.


[Verse 4] 
For I have seen You, Rock of Ages, And I will never be the same. Oh, I love You, Rock of Ages, And I will always love Your name.
