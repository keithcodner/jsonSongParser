[Verse 1] 
Here we are, Lord, More weak than strong; Still believing, still pressing on. Make us ready With hearts that are brave. We will silence the lies of this age.


[Verse 2] 
For such a moment we have been born. We're gonna rise up, Take this world by storm. Let evil tremble, We come in His name. Our God is with us, We're dangerous people.


[Verse 3] 
All God's heroes failed as we do, Sometimes doubting all that is true. Yet He calls us great people of faith, Working through us as history is made. 


[Verse 4] 
For such a moment we have been born. We're gonna rise up, Take this world by storm. Let evil tremble, We come in His name. Our God is with us, We're dangerous people.
