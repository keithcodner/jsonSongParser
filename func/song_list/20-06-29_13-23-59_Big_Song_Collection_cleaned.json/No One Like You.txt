[Verse 1] 
There's no one lik[D]e you in all the ear[G]th There's no one lik[D]e you in the he[G]avens There's no one lik[D]e you who knows my wea[Bm7]kness Who knows my frai[G]lty and my des[D]i [A]- re[D][A]


[Verse 2] 
Is to know[D] you all my d[G]ays Is to know[D] you as my Sa[G]vior Is to know[D] you in your bea[Bm7]uty In your po[G]wer and your g[D]lor[A]y[D][A] There's no one like[D] you, No one[G] There's no one like[D] you, No one[G]


[Verse 3] 
There's no one like you in all the earth There's no one like you in the heavens There's no one like you who sings so sweetly Who shines so brighty and is so holy


[Verse 4] 
And I will praise you all my days I will praise you as my Savior I will praise you in you beauty In your power and your glory There's no one like you, No one There's no one like you, No one
