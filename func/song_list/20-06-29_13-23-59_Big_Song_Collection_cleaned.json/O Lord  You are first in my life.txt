[Verse 1] 
O Lord, You are first in my life; For You I live as a sacrifice, Holy in Your sight, pleasing to Your heart, As I put my trust in You.


[Verse 2] 
Precious Jesus, You paid such a cost, That I may know Your love, Your grace, Your touch; With everything I am, I want to know You more, My heart is open to You.


[Verse 3] 
As I seek You, Lord, You draw me nearer.


[Verse 4] 
I am Yours, Lord, I am Yours, Completely abandoned to You. I am Yours, Lord, I am Yours, Wholly devoted to You.
