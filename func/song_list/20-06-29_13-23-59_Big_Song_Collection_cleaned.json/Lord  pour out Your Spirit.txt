[Verse 1] 
Lord, pour out Your Spirit On all the peoples of the earth; Let Your sons and daughters Speak Your words of prophecy. Send us dreams and visions, Reveal the secrets of Your heart; Lord, our faith is rising, Let all heaven sound the coming of Yourday.


[Verse 2] 
There's gonna be a great awakening, There's gonna be a great revival in our land. There's gonna be a great awakening, And everyone who calls on Jesus, They will be saved.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, pour out Your Spirit On all the nations of the world; Let them see Your glory, Let them fall in reverent awe. Show Your mighty power, Shake the heavens and the earth; Lord, the world is waiting, Let creation see the coming of Your day. 


[Verse 4] 
There's gonna be a great awakening, There's gonna be a great revival in our land. There's gonna be a great awakening, And everyone who calls on Jesus, They will be saved.
