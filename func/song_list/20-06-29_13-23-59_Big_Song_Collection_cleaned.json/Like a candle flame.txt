[Verse 1] 
Like a candle flame, Flickering small in our darkness. Uncreated light Shines through infant eyes.


[Verse 2] 
God is with us, alleluia. (Men) God is with us, alleluia. (Women) Come to save us, alleluia. (Men) Come to save us, (Women) Alleluia! (All).


[Verse 3] 
Stars and angels sing, Yet the earth sleeps in shadows; Can this tiny spark Set a world on fire?


[Verse 4] 
God is with us, alleluia. (Men) God is with us, alleluia. (Women) Come to save us, alleluia. (Men) Come to save us, (Women) Alleluia! (All).


[Verse 5] 
Yet His light shall shine From our lives, Spirit blazing, As we touch the flame Of His holy fire. 


[Verse 6] 
God is with us, alleluia. (Men) God is with us, alleluia. (Women) Come to save us, alleluia. (Men) Come to save us, (Women) Alleluia! (All).
