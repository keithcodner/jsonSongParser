[Verse 1] 
I want to be holy, I want to be righteous, I want to live my life the way You want me to. I want to be blameless, Not walking in darkness, I want to be a living sacrifice to You.


[Verse 2] 
I'm gonna run the race, I'm gonna run to win, Throw off everything that hinders me. I'm gonna fix my eyes upon the King, And leave my sin behind.


[Verse 3] 
I want to be holy, I want to be righteous, I want to live my life the way You want me to. I want to be blameless, Not walking in darkness, I want to be a living sacrifice to You.


[Verse 4] 
I want to be so much better, I want to be more like You. Keep taking me further and deeper, I want to right the wrong, I want to live this song, Now I'm pressing on, I'm gonna leave my sin behind.


[Verse 5] 
I want to be holy, I want to be righteous, I want to live my life the way You want me to. I want to be blameless, Not walking in darkness, I want to be a living sacrifice to You.


[Verse 6] 
Singing, 'goodbye rage, goodbye hate, Goodbye anger, goodbye malice, Goodbye bitterness and slander, Goodbye fear of man!' (Repeat) 


[Verse 7] 
I want to be holy, I want to be righteous, I want to live my life the way You want me to. I want to be blameless, Not walking in darkness, I want to be a living sacrifice to You.
