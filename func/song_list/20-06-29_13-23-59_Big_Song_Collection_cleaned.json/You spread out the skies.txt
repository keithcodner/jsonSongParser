[Verse 1] 
You spread out the skies Over empty space, Said 'Let there be light' - To a dark and formless world Your light was born.


[Verse 2] 
You spread out Your arms Over empty hearts, Said 'Let there be light' - To a dark and hopeless world Your Son was born.


[Verse 3] 
You made the world and saw that it was good, You sent Your only Son, for You are good.


[Verse 4] 
What a wonderful Maker, What a wonderful Saviour. How majestic Your whispers, And how humble Your love. With a strength like no other, And the heart of a Father, How majestic Your whispers, What a wonderful God.


[Verse 5] 
No eye has fully seen How beautiful the cross, And we have only heard The faintest whisper of How great You are.


[Verse 6] 
What a wonderful Maker, What a wonderful Saviour. How majestic Your whispers, And how humble Your love. With a strength like no other, And the heart of a Father, How majestic Your whispers, What a wonderful God.
