[Verse 1] 
You bless my life, and heal me inside, Over and over again. You touched my heart and brought peace of mind, Over and over again.


[Verse 2] 
All I can say is I love You. All I can say is I need You. All I can say is I thank You, Lord, For all that You've done in my life.


[Verse 3] 
You've been so kind and patient with me, Over and over again. When I have strayed You showed me the way, Over and over again. 


[Verse 4] 
All I can say is I love You. All I can say is I need You. All I can say is I thank You, Lord, For all that You've done in my life.
