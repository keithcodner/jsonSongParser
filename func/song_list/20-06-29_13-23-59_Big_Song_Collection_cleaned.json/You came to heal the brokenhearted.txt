[Verse 1] 
You came to heal the brokenhearted; You came to make the blind eyes see. Your light is burning now within us, As Your word of truth sets us free.


[Verse 2] 
And we will fill the earth with the love of God That's been shed abroad in our hearts, Share with every nation and every land The grace that He imparts. ||And we will sing a new song of joy and peace, A resounding trumpet call, Causing hearts to rise, opening eyes to see That Jesus, Jesus is Lord of all.


[Verse 3] 
You come in all Your mighty power, You come to bring the latter rain; We know You've filled us with Your Spirit And a love we cannot contain.


[Verse 4] 
And we will fill the earth with the love of God That's been shed abroad in our hearts, Share with every nation and every land The grace that He imparts. ||And we will sing a new song of joy and peace, A resounding trumpet call, Causing hearts to rise, opening eyes to see That Jesus, Jesus is Lord of all.


[Verse 5] 
You'll come in glory and splendour, You'll come to reign upon the earth; We know we'll live with You forever And declare Your mighty worth. 


[Verse 6] 
And we will fill the earth with the love of God That's been shed abroad in our hearts, Share with every nation and every land The grace that He imparts. ||And we will sing a new song of joy and peace, A resounding trumpet call, Causing hearts to rise, opening eyes to see That Jesus, Jesus is Lord of all.
