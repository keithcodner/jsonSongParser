[Verse 1] 
O Lord, I am devoted to You, All that I am I give You, Nothing do I withhold. I am nothing without You, All my hope is upon You, Simply telling You I am Yours, I am Yours.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, may my devotion be pleasing, Expressed through this song I am singing, Pouring my heart out to You, only You. ||You are the reason for living, I'm breathing: My refuge, my strength and my healing, So I give my heart unto You, Only You.


[Verse 3] 
Every earthly distraction Fades away to the background, I'm content just to be with You. Jesus, You satisfy my longing, To You do I cry, I'm coming, Kneeling before Your throne, At Your throne.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, may my devotion be pleasing, Expressed through this song I am singing, Pouring my heart out to You, only You. ||You are the reason for living, I'm breathing: My refuge, my strength and my healing, So I give my heart unto You, Only You.
