[Verse 1] 
I will praise You, O Lord, with all of my heart. I will praise You, O Lord, with all of my heart. Before the Gods I will sing Your praise. Before the Gods I will praise Your name.


[Verse 2] 
The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me. The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me. Do not forsake the work of Your hands, Revive me, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
You have exalted above all things Your name and Your word. You have exalted above all things Your name and Your word. I called to You, and You answered me. When I called to You, You made me strong.


[Verse 4] 
The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me. The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me. Do not forsake the work of Your hands, Revive me, Lord.


[Verse 5] 
For Your love, O Lord, endures forever, And Your faithfulness is to the clouds. Do not forsake the work of Your hands, Revive me, Lord. 


[Verse 6] 
The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me. The Lord will fulfil His purpose for me. Do not forsake the work of Your hands, Revive me, Lord.
