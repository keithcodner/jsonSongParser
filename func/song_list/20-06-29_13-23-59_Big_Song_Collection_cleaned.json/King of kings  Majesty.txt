[Verse 1] 
King of kings, Majesty, God of heaven living in me. Gentle Saviour, closest Friend, Strong Deliverer, Beginning and End: All within me falls at Your throne.


[Verse 2] 
Your majesty, I can but bow; I lay my all before You now. In royal robes I don't deserve, I live to serve Your majesty.


[Verse 3] 
Earth and heaven worship You, Love eternal, faithful and true, Who bought the nations, Ransomed souls, Brought this sinner Near to Your throne: All within me cries out in praise.


[Verse 4] 
Your majesty, I can but bow; I lay my all before You now. In royal robes I don't deserve, I live to serve Your majesty.
