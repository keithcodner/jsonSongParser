[Verse 1] 
Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious; See the Man of Sorrows now, From the fight returned victorious; Every knee to Him shall bow: Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crowns become the Victor's brow.


[Verse 2] 
Crown the Saviour, angels, crown Him; Rich the trophies Jesus brings; In the seat of power enthrone Him, While the vault of heaven rings: Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown the Saviour, King of kings!


[Verse 3] 
Sinners in derision crowned Him, Mocking thus the Saviour's claim; Saints and angels throng around Him, Own His title, praise His name: Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Spread abroad the Victor's fame.


[Verse 4] 
Hark, those bursts of acclamation! Hark, those loud triumphant chords! Jesus takes the highest station: O what joy the sight affords! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him! King of kings, and Lord of Lords!
