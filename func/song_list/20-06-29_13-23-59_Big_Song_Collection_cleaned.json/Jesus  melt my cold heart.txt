[Verse 1] 
Jesus, melt my cold heart, Break my stony emotions. 'Cause I've been playing with the waves When I should be swimming in the ocean.


[Verse 2] 
Take me deeper, Show me more. It's all or nothing; I give You everything, my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, show Your mercy, I'm so sorry for waiting; I should be running to Your heart, But I know I've been hesitating.


[Verse 4] 
Take me deeper, Show me more. It's all or nothing; I give You everything, my Lord.
