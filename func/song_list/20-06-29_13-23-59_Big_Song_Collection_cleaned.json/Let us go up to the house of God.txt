[Verse 1] 
Let us go up to the house of God With a shout of praise, With a song of celebration. We'll ascend the hill of the Lord, We can stand in the holy place.


[Verse 2] 
We can have clean hands and a pure heart; His blood can cleanse us from all our unrighteousness. He has made a way though the cross; Jesus' blood was shed for us. We can draw near to our God.


[Verse 3] 
Now His body has been broken, And the curtain torn in two. We can enter by a new and living way Before His throne. Yes, we can fellowship with Him, The King of glory, King of kings.
