[Verse 1] 
No other name but the name of Jesus, No other name but the name of the Lord; No other name but the name of Jesus Is worthy of glory, and worthy of honour, And worthy of power and all praise.


[Verse 2] 
His name is exalted far above the earth, His name is high above the heavens; His name is exalted far above the earth, Give glory and honour and praise unto His name.
