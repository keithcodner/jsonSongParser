[Verse 1] 
Sacred, holy, pure, Lord of space and time, Dwells in perfect light, Radiance sublime. Sacred holy songs Rise on wings of praise; All creation rings With echoes of Your grace.


[Verse 2] 
And oh, my grateful heart rejoices at Your name. And oh, my grateful heart rejoices at Your name.


[Verse 3] 
Sacred, risen Son, Peerless Lamb of God; Mercy, grace and peace Rolling like a flood. Promise forged in pain, Forgiveness bought by blood; Sealed with sacred words From the mouth of God.


[Verse 4] 
And oh, my grateful heart rejoices at Your name. And oh, my grateful heart rejoices at Your name.
