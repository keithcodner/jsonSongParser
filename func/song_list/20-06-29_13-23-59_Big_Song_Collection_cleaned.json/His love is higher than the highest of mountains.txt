[Verse 1] 
His love is higher than the highest of mountains. His love goes deeper that the deepest ofseas. His love, it stretches to the farthest horizon, And His love, it reaches to me.


[Verse 2] 
His love is stronger than the angels and demons. His love, it keeps me in my life's darkest hour. His love secures me on the pathway to heaven, And His love is my strength and power.


[Verse 3] 
His love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey. His love is better than the choicest of wine. His love, it satisfies the deepest of hunger, And His love, in Jesus it's mine.


[Verse 4] 
Your love is higher than the highest of mountains. Your love goes deeper that the deepest ofseas. Your love, it stretches to the farthest horizon, And your love, it reaches to me.
