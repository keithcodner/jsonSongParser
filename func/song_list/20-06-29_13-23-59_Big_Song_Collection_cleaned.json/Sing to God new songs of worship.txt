[Verse 1] 
Sing to God new songs of worship: All His deeds are marvellous; He has brought salvation to us With His hand and holy arm: He has shown to all the nations Righteousness and saving power; He recalled His truth and mercy To His people Israel.


[Verse 2] 
Sing to God new songs of worship: Earth has seen His victory; Let the lands of earth be joyful Praising Him with thankfulness: Sound upon the harp His praises, Play to Him with melody; Let the trumpets sound His triumph, Show your joy to God the King!


[Verse 3] 
Sing to God new songs of worship: Let the sea now make a noise; All on earth and in the waters Sound your praises to the Lord: Let the hills be joyful together, Let the rivers clap their hands, For with righteousness and justice He will come to judge the earth.
