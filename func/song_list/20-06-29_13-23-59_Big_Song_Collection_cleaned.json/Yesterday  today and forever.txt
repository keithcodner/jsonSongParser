[Verse 1] 
Yesterday, today and forever You're the same, All the promises of God Find their 'yes' in You. Demons flee, strongholds fall, They must bow before Your name, No authority, no power is higher than You. 


[Verse 2] 
Let's sing our praise to the Lord, Thank You for the great things You have done. Let's sing with all of our hearts, There's no Father like You. Let's dance for joy to the Lord, For You have washed our sins away. We're more than conquerors, With You close by our side. 


[Verse 3] 
Yesterday, today and forever You're the same, We need never fear To put all our trust in You. For Your word is a rock And a light to show the way, And a sword that will pierce Through the darkness each day.


[Verse 4] 
Let's sing our praise to the Lord, Thank You for the great things You have done. Let's sing with all of our hearts, There's no Father like You. Let's dance for joy to the Lord, For You have washed our sins away. We're more than conquerors, With You close by our side.
