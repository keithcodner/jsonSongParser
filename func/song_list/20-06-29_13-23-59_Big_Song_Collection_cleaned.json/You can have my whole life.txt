[Verse 1] 
You can have my whole life, You can come and have it all: I don't want to go my own way now, I love to feel Your presence And I know Your saving grace. I am nothing when You are second place.


[Verse 2] 
I've been born to give You praise, Not to yearn and strive for worldly things. I've been born to love Your ways, Take my pride and let me always say: I want to go Your way now.
