[Verse 1] 
I believe in everything You do, All You have to say. I've come to realise You're the only way, Oh, I believe in You.


[Verse 2] 
I've received something in my life Greater than before: Your truth has set me free and I love You, Lord, Oh, I believe in You.


[Verse 3] 
Let the angels sing of the Lord's great love, Well, it's shining down like the heavens above. Let the nations bow to the living God And know Your truth, I believe in You.


[Verse 4] 
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in You. I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in You.


[Verse 5] 
Let the angels sing of the Lord's great love, Well, it's shining down like the heavens above. Let the nations bow to the living God And know Your truth, I believe in You.
