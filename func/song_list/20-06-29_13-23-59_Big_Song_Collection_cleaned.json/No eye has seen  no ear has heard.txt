[Verse 1] 
No eye has seen, no ear has heard, No mind has conceived what the Lord has prepared; But by His Spirit, He has revealed His plan to those who love Him. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
We've been held by His everlasting love, Led with loving kindness by His hand; We have hope for the future yet to come, In time we'll understand the mystery of His plan.
