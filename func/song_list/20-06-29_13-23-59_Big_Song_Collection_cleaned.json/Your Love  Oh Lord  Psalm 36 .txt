[Verse 1] 
Your [G]love, oh Lord[C9], reaches to the [G]heavens[D/F#]. Your [Em7]faithfulness[C9] stretches to the [G]sky[D/F#]; [Em7]Your righteous[C9]ness is like the mighty [G]mountain[D/F#], And Your [Em7]justice flows [C9]like the ocean's [G]tides[D/F#].


[Verse 2] 
And I will lift my [D]voice to [C9]worship You my [G]King; And I will find my [D]strength in the [C9]shadow of Your [Am]wings[D].
