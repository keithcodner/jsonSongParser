[Verse 1] 
It is the cry of my heart To follow You. It is the cry of my heart To be close to You. It is the cry of my heart to follow All of the days of my life.


[Verse 2] 
Teach me Your holy ways, O Lord, So I can walk in Your truth. Teach me Your holy ways, O Lord, And make me wholly devoted to You.


[Verse 3] 
It is the cry of my heart To follow You. It is the cry of my heart To be close to You. It is the cry of my heart to follow All of the days of my life.


[Verse 4] 
Open my eyes so I can see The wonderful things that You do. Open my heart up more and more And make it wholly devoted to You. 


[Verse 5] 
It is the cry of my heart To follow You. It is the cry of my heart To be close to You. It is the cry of my heart to follow All of the days of my life.
