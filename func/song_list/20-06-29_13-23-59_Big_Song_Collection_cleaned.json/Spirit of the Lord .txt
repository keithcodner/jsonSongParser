[Verse 1] 
Spirit of the Lord, come down among us now; Minister new life to bones grown dry. Something in our heart cries out to be made whole: The touch of healing love.


[Verse 2] 
Give us just a glimpse of God, of Jesus' heart, Open ears to hear the voice say, 'Come': Look up, look up, look up and see The light of healing love.
