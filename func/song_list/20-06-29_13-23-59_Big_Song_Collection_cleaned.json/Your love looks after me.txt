[Verse 1] 
Your love looks after me, It never fails. Your word takes care of me, And keeps my mind on You. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
You are majestic Through all the earth; I am Your servant For the rest of my days.


[Verse 3] 
You are magnificent, The God of glory; I'm going to worship You For the rest of my days, For the rest of my days, For the rest of my days.
