[Verse 1] 
Your voice is like thunder, Your eyes like fire; Your throne is forever, In unapproachable light. Your grace is so tender, Your love like wine; To You I surrender, I lay down my life.


[Verse 2] 
And all I want to do Is to build a house of gold, Purest silver and costly stones; Let it stand when the fire comes, When the day brings Your light. ||Be my wisdom and be my strength, Fill me up with Your faithfulness; Keep me loving until the end. Let the fire in Your eyes See a living sacrifice, Pleasing in Your sight.


[Verse 3] 
Let me build a house of gold Purest silver and costly stones; Let it stand when the fire comes, When the day brings Your light. ||Be my wisdom and be my strength, Fill me up with Your faithfulness; Keep me loving until the end. Let the fire in Your eyes See a living sacrifice, Pleasing in Your sight.
