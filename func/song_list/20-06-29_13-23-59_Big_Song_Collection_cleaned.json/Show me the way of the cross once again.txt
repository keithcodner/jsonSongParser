[Verse 1] 
Show me the way of the cross once again, Denying myself for the love that I've gained. Everything's You now, everything's changed; It's time You had my whole life, You can have it all.


[Verse 2] 
Yes, I resolve to give it all; Some things must die, some things must live, Not 'what can I gain', but 'what can I give'. If much is required when much is received, Then You can have my whole life, Jesus, have it all.


[Verse 3] 
I've given like a beggar but lived like the rich, And crafted myself a more comfortable cross. Yet what I am called to is deeper than this; It's time You had my whole life, You can have it all. 


[Verse 4] 
Yes, I resolve to give it all; Some things must die, some things must live, Not 'what can I gain', but 'what can I give'. If much is required when much is received, Then You can have my whole life, Jesus, have it all.
