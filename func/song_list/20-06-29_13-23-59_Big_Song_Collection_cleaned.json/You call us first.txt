You call us first to love Your name, To worship You. To please Your heart our one desire, O Lord.

Your honour, Lord, Your name's renown We long to see. So let the glory of Your name Be praised.

If there's one thing we are called to do, It's to love You, to adore You. We will bring our all and worship You, Bow before You, as we love You.
