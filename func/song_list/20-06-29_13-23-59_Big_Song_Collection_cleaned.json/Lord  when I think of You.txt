[Verse 1] 
Lord, when I think of You, And what I put You through, I'll never understand Your endless mercy. ||To think You chose to come, Embodied in Your Son To fall into the hands of Your created. Oh, feel my heart explode with praise, yeah.


[Verse 2] 
I give You all my love, I give You everything. You are God of heaven, and head over heels with me! I know You burn with passion, when I call on Your name, Your love runs as a river, washing my shame away, Restoring my faith again, yeah.


[Verse 3] 
How did You look upon The sight of Your own blood? You even took the sin of those who nailed You! ||For grace and justice meet In Him who's chosen me To walk a path that takes me on to heaven. Oh, feel my heart explode with praise, yeah.


[Verse 4] 
I give You all my love, I give You everything. You are God of heaven, and head over heels with me! I know You burn with passion, when I call on Your name, Your love runs as a river, washing my shame away, Restoring my faith again, yeah.
