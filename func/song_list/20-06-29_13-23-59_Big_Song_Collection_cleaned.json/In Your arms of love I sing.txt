[Verse 1] 
In Your arms of love I sing, Giving glory to my King: I have come to seek Your face In this secret, secret place. And I will bow before Your throne, For my life is not my own. 


[Verse 2] 
And I will praise You, Every day I'll come before Your throne. I am holy unto You. And I will give You All my hopes, my dreams I lay them down. Lord, may I be found in You. 


[Verse 3] 
I have taken up my cross, What was gain I've counted loss. Father, let Your will be done For I am broken by this love. Send Your fire to purify, Jesus, teach me how to die.


[Verse 4] 
And I will praise You, Every day I'll come before Your throne. I am holy unto You. And I will give You All my hopes, my dreams I lay them down. Lord, may I be found in You. 


[Verse 5] 
And I will follow You, my Lord, Forevermore and ever more, And I will follow You, my Lord, Forevermore. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
And I will praise You, Every day I'll come before Your throne. I am holy unto You. And I will give You All my hopes, my dreams I lay them down. Lord, may I be found in You.
