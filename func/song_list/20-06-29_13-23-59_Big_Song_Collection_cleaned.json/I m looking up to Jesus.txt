[Verse 1] 
I'm looking up to Jesus, His face is shining beauty. I'm feeling so unworthy, Yet His Spirit leads me on. I'm looking up to Jesus, His radiance surrounds me. I feel so pure and clean, A taste of heaven on earth.


[Verse 2] 
I'm looking up to Jesus, His face is shining beauty. I'm feeling so unworthy, Yet His Spirit leads me on. I'm looking up to Jesus, His radiance surrounds me. I feel so pure and clean, A taste of heaven on earth. I'm looking up to Jesus.
