[Verse 1] 
We will give ourselves no rest Till Your kingdom comes on earth; You've positioned watchmen on the walls. Now our prayers will flow like tears, For You've shared Your heart with us; God of heaven, on our knees we fall. ||Come down in power, Reveal Your heart again; Come hear our cries, The tears that plead for rain.


[Verse 2] 
We're knocking, Knocking on the door of heaven, We're crying, Crying for this generation; We're praying for Your name to be known In all of the earth. ||We're watching, Watching on the walls to see You, We're looking, Looking for a time of breakthrough; We're praying for Your word to bear fruit In all of the earth, in all of the earth.
