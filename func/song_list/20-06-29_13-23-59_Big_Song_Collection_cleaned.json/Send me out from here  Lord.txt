[Verse 1] 
Send me out from here, Lord, To serve a world in need. May I know no man by the coat he wears, But the heart that Jesus sees. ||And may the light of Your face Shine upon me, Lord. You have filled my heart with the greatest joy, And my cup is overflowing.


[Verse 2] 
'Go now, and carry the news To all creation, every race and tongue. Take no purse with you, Take nothing to eat For He will supply your needs.'


[Verse 3] 
Send me out from here, Lord, To serve a world in need. May I know no man by the coat he wears, But the heart that Jesus sees. ||And may the light of Your face Shine upon me, Lord. You have filled my heart with the greatest joy, And my cup is overflowing.


[Verse 4] 
'Go now, bearing the light, Living for others, Fearlessly walking into the night; Take no thought for your lives, Like lambs among wolves, Full of the Spirit, ready to die.' 


[Verse 5] 
Send me out from here, Lord, To serve a world in need. May I know no man by the coat he wears, But the heart that Jesus sees. ||And may the light of Your face Shine upon me, Lord. You have filled my heart with the greatest joy, And my cup is overflowing.
