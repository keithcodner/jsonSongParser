[Verse 1] 
It [C]came u[F]pon a [C]midnight clear That [F]glorious [D7]song of [G]old[G7] From [C]angels [F]bending [C]near the earth To [F]touch their [G7]harps of [C]gold "Peace [E7]on the earth, good [Am]will to men From [G]heaven's all [D7]gracious [G]King;"[G7] The [C]world in [F]solemn [C]stillness lay, To [F]hear the [G7]angels [C]sing


[Verse 2] 
Sti[C]ll thr[F]ough t[C]he cloven skies they come With [F]peaceful [D7]wings un[G]furl[G7]ed, And s[C]till th[F]eir heav[C]enly music floats O'e[F]r all the we[G7]ary world[C] Above i[E7]ts sad and lowly pla[Am]ins They [G]bend on hover[D7]ing wing;[G][G7] And [C]ever o'er[F] its Ba[C]bel sounds The[F] blessed [G7]angels [C]sing


[Verse 3] 
And[C] ye, b[F]eneath[C] life's crushing load Whose[F] forms ar[D7]e bendin[G]g lo[G7]w, Who t[C]oil alo[F]ng the c[C]limbing way Wit[F]h painful st[G7]eps and s[C]low Look no[E7]w! for glad and gold[Am]en hours Come [G]swiftly on th[D7]e wing;[G][G7] O re[C]st beside[F] the we[C]ary road And[F] hear the[G7] angels[C] sing


[Verse 4] 
For[C] lo th[F]e days[C] are hast'ning on By pr[F]ophets se[D7]en of ol[G]d[G7] When [C]with th[F]e ever-c[C]ircling years Sha[F]ll come the [G7]time fore[C]told When pe[E7]ace shall over all t[Am]he earth Its a[G]ncient splend[D7]our fling[G][G7] And [C]all the w[F]orld gi[C]ve back the song Whi[F]ch now th[G7]e angel[C]s sing
