[Verse 1] 
Jesus, send more labourers, For, Lord, we see the need; The land is ready for harvest, The fields are ripe indeed.


[Verse 2] 
Oh Lord, but start with me, Jesus, begin with me. Who will go for You, Lord? Who will go for You, Lord? Here I am, Lord, Send me, Send me, Lord, Send me.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, we love our country, Countless lives to be won; Jesus, bring revival, That through us Your will be done.


[Verse 4] 
Oh Lord, but start with me, Jesus, begin with me. Who will go for You, Lord? Who will go for You, Lord? Here I am, Lord, Send me, Send me, Lord, Send me.


[Verse 5] 
Lord, we sense Your moving, Touching our lives with power; We are ready to serve You, To go this day, this hour. 


[Verse 6] 
Oh Lord, but start with me, Jesus, begin with me. Who will go for You, Lord? Who will go for You, Lord? Here I am, Lord, Send me, Send me, Lord, Send me.
