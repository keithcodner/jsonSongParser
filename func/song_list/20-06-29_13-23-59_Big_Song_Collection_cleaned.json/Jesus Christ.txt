[Verse 1] 
Jesus Christ, You came into this world to rescue me. On the cross, My sin was laid on You, what agony. There Your precious life-blood flowed so free. Every drop that fell still cleanses me.


[Verse 2] 
All Your love All Your love All Your love All Your love Pouring out for me like a flood.


[Verse 3] 
I am safe Upon the ocean of Your mercy. I am loved With all the passion of eternity. It is deeper than the deepest sea; Like a tidal wave it carries me.


[Verse 4] 
All Your love All Your love All Your love All Your love Sweeping over me like a flood.


[Verse 5] 
So I stand Upon Your promise of eternal grace. I believe That I will one day see You face to face. I will worship You forevermore In ways I never have before.


[Verse 6] 
All my love All my love All my love All my love Flowing out to You like a flood.
