[Verse 1] 
Who can stand before the Lord In His holy place? Who can walk upon the hill of the Lord? Only he whose hands are clean, Only he whose heart is pure Can stand before the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
I will stand, I will come Before the presence of the King: For His blood washes me from sin, I enter in.


[Verse 3] 
There is One who stands for me In the holy place, And He walked the lonely hill to the cross. And I know His hands are clean, And I know His heart is pure, He is Jesus Christ the Lamb.


[Verse 4] 
I will stand, I will come Before the presence of the King: For His blood washes me from sin, I enter in.
