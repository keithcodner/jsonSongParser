[Verse 1] 
O for a closer walk with God, A calm and heavenly frame. A light that shines upon the road, Leading to the Lamb.


[Verse 2] 
Where is the bless√®dness I knew When I once saw the Lord? Where is the soul refreshing view Living in His word?


[Verse 3] 
A light to be my guide, The Father's presence at my side. In Your will my rest I find. O for a closer walk with God, Leading to the Lamb.


[Verse 4] 
So shall my walk be close with God With all the hopes made new. So purer light shall mark the road Leading to the Lamb.


[Verse 5] 
A light to be my guide, The Father's presence at my side. In Your will my rest I find. O for a closer walk with God, Leading to the Lamb.
