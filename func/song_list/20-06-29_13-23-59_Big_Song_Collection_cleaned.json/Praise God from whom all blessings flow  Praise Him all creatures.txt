[Verse 1] 
Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him all creatures here below. Praise Him above, you heavenly host, Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Give glory to the Father, Give glory to the Son, Give glory to the Spirit While endless ages run. ||'Worthy the Lamb' All heaven cries, 'To be exalted thus:' 'Worthy the Lamb' Our hearts reply, 'For He was slain for us.'


[Verse 3] 
Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise God from whom all blessings flow.(x4)
