[Verse 1] 
Here am I, a sinner free, Pardoned by Your majesty, Your love has led me into liberty. Holy King, upon the throne, You've made this heart Your very own. I feel like the leper who's been healed.


[Verse 2] 
Lost and dirty, yet You found me. Stained by sin, but You have cleansed me. Can it be I'm precious in Your sight? What is man, and who am I? A child of God, my Father's pride, What a joy to be the Lord's delight.


[Verse 3] 
I have known a love so sweet, A saving love that brings relief, A healing love that makes the blind eye see. King of Love and Prince of Peace, Your Shepherd's love is tending me â€“ A love that satisfies my deepest needs.


[Verse 4] 
Lost and dirty, yet You found me. Stained by sin, but You have cleansed me. Can it be I'm precious in Your sight? What is man, and who am I? A child of God, my Father's pride, What a joy to be the Lord's delight.
