[Verse 1] 
We shall stand With our feet on the Rock. Whatever men may say, We'll lift Your name up high.|| And we shall walk Through the darkest night. Setting our faces like flint; We'll walk into the light.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, You have chosen me For fruitfulness, To be transformed into Your likeness. I'm gonna fight on through Till I see You face to face.


[Verse 3] 
We shall stand With our feet on the Rock. Whatever men may say, We'll lift Your name up high.|| And we shall walk Through the darkest night. Setting our faces like flint; We'll walk into the light.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, as Your witnesses You've appointed us. And with Your Holy Spirit Anointed us. And so I'll fight on through, Till I see You face to face. 


[Verse 5] 
We shall stand With our feet on the Rock. Whatever men may say, We'll lift Your name up high.|| And we shall walk Through the darkest night. Setting our faces like flint; We'll walk into the light.
