All I [Am]once held [C]dear, built my [F]life [G]upon[C], All this [Am]world reve[C]res and [Am]wars to [G]own; All I [F]once [F/C]thought [C]gain I have [F]counte[G]d los[C]s, Spent and [Am]worthless [C]now compa[Am]red to [G]this.

Now my heart’s desire is to know You more, To be found in You and known as Yours, To possess by faith what I could not earn, All surpassing gift of righteousness.
