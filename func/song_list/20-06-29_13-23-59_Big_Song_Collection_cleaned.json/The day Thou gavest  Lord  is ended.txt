[Verse 1] 
The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended, The darkness falls at Thy behest; To Thee our morning hymns ascended, Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.


[Verse 2] 
We thank Thee that Thy church unsleeping, While earth rolls onward into light, Through all the world her watch is keeping, And rests not now by day or night.


[Verse 3] 
As o'er each continent and island The dawn leads on another day, The voice of prayer is never silent, Nor dies the strain of praise away.


[Verse 4] 
The sun that bids us rest is waking Our brethren 'neath the western sky, And hour by hour fresh lips are making Thy wondrous doings heard on high.


[Verse 5] 
So be it, Lord! Thy throne shall never, Like earth's proud empires, pass away; Thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever, Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.
