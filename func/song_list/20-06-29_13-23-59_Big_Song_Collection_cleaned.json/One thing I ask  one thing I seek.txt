[Verse 1] 
One thing I ask, one thing I seek, That I may dwell in Your house, O Lord. All of my days, all of my life, That I may see You, Lord. 


[Verse 2] 
Hear me, O Lord, hear me when I cry; Lord, do not hide Your face from me. You have been my strength, You have been my shield, And You will lift me up.


[Verse 3] 
One thing I ask, One thing I desire Is to see You, Is to see You.
