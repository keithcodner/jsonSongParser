[Verse 1] 
You are my foundation, You are my salvation, A very present help in times of need. You are my protection, You are my resurrection, A higher place is where You're taking me.


[Verse 2] 
I get lifted up on eagles' wings, You lift me up and so I sing:


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah to the King. Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah to the King.


[Verse 4] 
You are my Redeemer, You are my Healer, A promise given, one of liberty. You are my Restorer, You are my strong tower, The joy of the Lord will be my strength.


[Verse 5] 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah to the King. Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah to the King.
