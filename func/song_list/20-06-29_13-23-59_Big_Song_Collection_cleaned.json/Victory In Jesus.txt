[Verse 1] 
I [G]heard an old, old story, [G/B]How a [C]Savior came from [G]glory, How He [Em]gave His life on [G]Calvary To [A]save a wretch like [D]me; I [G]heard about His groaning [G/B]Of His [C]precious blood's a[G]toning, Then [Em]I repented [G]of my sins and [C6]won the [Dsus]vic[D]to[G]ry.


[Verse 2] 
O [G]victory in Jesus my [C]Savior, for[G]ever! He [Em]sought me and [G]bought me with [A]His redeeming [D]blood; He [G]loved me ere I knew Him, and [C]all my love is [G]due Him He plunged me to victory be[C]neath the [Dsus]clean[D]sing [G]flood.


[Verse 3] 
I [G]heard about His healing, [G/B]Of His [C]cleansing power re[G]vealing, How He [Em]made the lame to [G]walk again And [A]caused the blind to [D]see; And [G]then I cried "Dear Jesus, [G/B]Come and [C]heal my broken [G]spirit," And [Em]somehow Jesus [G]came and brought to [C6]me the [Dsus]vic[D]to[G]ry.


[Verse 4] 
O [G]victory in Jesus my [C]Savior, for[G]ever! He [Em]sought me and [G]bought me with [A]His redeeming [D]blood; He [G]loved me ere I knew Him, and [C]all my love is [G]due Him He plunged me to victory be[C]neath the [Dsus]clean[D]sing [G]flood.


[Verse 5] 
I [G]heard about a mansion [G/B]He has [C]built for me in [G]glory, And I [Em]heard about the [G]streets of gold Be[A]yond the crystal [D]sea; A[G]bout the angels singing [G/B]And the [C]old redemption [G]story, And [Em]some sweet day I'll [G]sing up there the [C6]song of [Dsus]vic[D]to[G]ry.


[Verse 6] 
O [G]victory in Jesus my [C]Savior, for[G]ever! He [Em]sought me and [G]bought me with [A]His redeeming [D]blood; He [G]loved me ere I knew Him, and [C]all my love is [G]due Him He plunged me to victory be[C]neath the [Dsus]clean[D]sing [G]flood.
