[Verse 1] 
My heart is not raised up too high, My eyes don't search beyond the sky. I do not seek what can't be known, Nor fret myself over mysteries.


[Verse 2] 
But I have calmed and soothed my soul, Like a child at rest in its mother's arms; Like this child sleeping by my side, My soul, in God, knows peace and calm.


[Verse 3] 
All you who love and trust your God, In this God shall you put your hope, For there you'll find unfailing love, From this time forth, and forever more.
