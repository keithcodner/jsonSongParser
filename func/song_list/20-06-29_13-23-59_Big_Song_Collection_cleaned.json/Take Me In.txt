[Verse 1] 
[Em]Take me past the outer courts and [Cmaj7]thru the holy place, [D]Past the brazen altar; Lord, I [Em]want to see Your [Cmaj7]face;|[D]| [Em]Pass me by the crowds of people, and the [Cmaj7]priests who sing their praise; I [D]hunger and thirst for Your righteousness, But its [Am7]only found one [Cmaj7]place.[D]


[Verse 2] 
So take me [Em]in to the Holy of [D/E]Holies, Take me [Am7]in by the [Am7/D]blood of the [Em]Lamb;[Cmaj7][D] So take me [Em]in to the Holy of [D/E]Holies, Take the [Am7]coal, [Am7/D]cleanse my [D]lips, here I [Em]am.
