[Verse 1] 
Though trials will come, Don't fear, don't run. Lift up your eyes, Hold fast, be strong. Have faith, keep on believing. ||Lift up your eyes For God is at work in us, Moulding and shaping us Out of His love for us, Making us more like Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
Consider it joy, pure joy When troubles come. Many trials will make you strong. Consider it joy, pure joy And stand your ground, Then at last you'll wear a crown.


[Verse 3] 
Though trials will come, Won't fear, won't run. We'll lift up our eyes, Hold fast, be strong. Have faith, keep on believing. ||We'll lift up our eyes For God is at work in us, Moulding and shaping us Out of His love for us, Making us more like Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
Consider it joy, pure joy When troubles come. Many trials will make you strong. Consider it joy, pure joy And stand your ground, Then at last you'll wear a crown.


[Verse 5] 
Joy, pure joy, Consider it joy, pure joy. Joy, pure joy, Consider it joy, pure joy.


[Verse 6] 
Consider it joy, pure joy When troubles come. Many trials will make you strong. Consider it joy, pure joy And stand your ground, Then at last you'll wear a crown.


[Verse 7] 
Patiently trusting Him, Ready for anything, Till we're complete in Him, In everything more like Jesus.


[Verse 8] 
Consider it joy, pure joy When troubles come. Many trials will make you strong. Consider it joy, pure joy And stand your ground, Then at last you'll wear a crown.
