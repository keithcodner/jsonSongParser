[Verse 1] 
We are Your inheritance, We are Your reward. (Repeat) And You're our glory And the lifter of our heads; You're our glory And the lifter of our heads.


[Verse 2] 
Listen, can you hear it? The Spirit and the Bride. (Repeat) Whisper 'Jesus! Maranatha! Come!' Whisper 'Jesus! Maranatha! Come!'


[Verse 3] 
O come, O come to us! O come, O come to us! Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! O come, O come to us!
