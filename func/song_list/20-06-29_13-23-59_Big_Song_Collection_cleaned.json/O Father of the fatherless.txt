[Verse 1] 
O Father of the fatherless, In whom all families are blessed, I love the way You father me. You gave me life, forgave the past, Now in Your arms I'm safe at last, I love the way You father me.


[Verse 2] 
Father me, forever You'll father me, And in Your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way You father me. I love the way You father me.


[Verse 3] 
When bruised and broken I draw near You hold me close and dry my tears, I love the way You father me. At last my fearful heart is still, Surrendered to Your perfect will, I love the way You father me.


[Verse 4] 
Father me, forever You'll father me, And in Your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way You father me. I love the way You father me.


[Verse 5] 
If in my foolishness I stray, Returning empty and ashamed, I love the way You father me. Exchanging for my wretchedness Your radiant robes of righteousness, I love the way You father me.


[Verse 6] 
Father me, forever You'll father me, And in Your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way You father me. I love the way You father me.


[Verse 7] 
And when I look into Your eyes From deep within my spirit cries, I love the way You father me. Before such love I stand amazed And ever will through endless days, I love the way You father me. 


[Verse 8] 
Father me, forever You'll father me, And in Your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way You father me. I love the way You father me.
