[Verse 1] 
Thank You, Lord, for Your love to me. By Your truth You have set me free. Through the cross I can enter in. What seemed impossible till I let You Wash away my sin, Take away all shame By the life-giving blood Of Jesus, my Redeemer. 


[Verse 2] 
Holy, I stand before You, Truly, I am blameless in Your sight. Righteous, a royal robe I don't deserve, Yet You choose to clothe me still, Precious mercy. 


[Verse 3] 
Such mercy, such grace, Such kindness to save Even a sinner like me. I'll love You, I'll serve You, I'll praise You forever, Thank You, Lord, for Your love to me. 


[Verse 4] 
Holy, I stand before You, Truly, I am blameless in Your sight. Righteous, a royal robe I don't deserve, Yet You choose to clothe me still, Precious mercy.
