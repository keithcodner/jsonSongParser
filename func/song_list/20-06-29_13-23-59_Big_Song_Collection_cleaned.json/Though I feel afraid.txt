[Verse 1] 
Though I feel afraid Of territory unknown, I know that I can say That I do not stand alone. For Jesus, You have promised Your presence in my heart; I cannot see the ending, But it's here that I must start.


[Verse 2] 
And all I know is You have called me, And that I will follow is all I can say. I will go where You will send me, And Your fire lights my way.


[Verse 3] 
What lies across the waves May cause my heart to fear; Will I survive the day, Must I leave what's known and dear? A ship that's in the harbour Is still and safe from harm, But it was not built to be there, It was made for wind and storm. 


[Verse 4] 
And all I know is You have called me, And that I will follow is all I can say. I will go where You will send me, And Your fire lights my way.
