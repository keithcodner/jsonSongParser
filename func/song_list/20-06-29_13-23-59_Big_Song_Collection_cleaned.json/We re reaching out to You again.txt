[Verse 1] 
We're reaching out to You again. We're in the upper room again. We feel the Spirit's wave, We're in pre-revival days. We're kneeling on the floor again. We're crying out for more again. We're seeking for Your face We're in pre-revival days.


[Verse 2] 
You say where our treasure is, There is our heart. You say where our treasure is, There is our heart.


[Verse 3] 
We're looking at our lives again. Your love has filled our eyes again. We cherish Your embrace, We're in pre-revival days. We're praying for the lost again. The hardened heart is soft again. No one is turned away, We're in pre-revival days.


[Verse 4] 
We're talking in the streets again. You're showing us what to speak again. The demons scream with rage, We're in pre-revival days.


[Verse 5] 
But a single song Can never change our ways, So we cry to You, Lord, You are mighty to save.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus out in front again. Jesus on our tongues again. We're rising up in faith To see revival days. We're praying for our land again. You've stayed Your patient hand again. This nation needs Your grace To see revival days.
