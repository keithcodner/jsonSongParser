[Verse 1] 
Lord of every heart, I'm coming back to You. I'm standing in the shallows Of what Your love can do; Remembering the joy Of laughter in the rain, I'm calling from the desert, Won't You fill me again?


[Verse 2] 
Fill me again, won't You fill me again? I'm tired and I'm thirsty And I've come to the end. Come cleanse me with fire, Refresh me with rain. O Breath of the Spirit, come closer.


[Verse 3] 
Lord of every deed, Your promise is enough; You're unreserved in mercy, And unrestrained in love. I'm casting down these crowns Of all that I can do; I'm trading my ambitions For a touch of You.


[Verse 4] 
Fill me again, won't You fill me again? I'm tired and I'm thirsty And I've come to the end. Come cleanse me with fire, Refresh me with rain. O Breath of the Spirit, come closer.
