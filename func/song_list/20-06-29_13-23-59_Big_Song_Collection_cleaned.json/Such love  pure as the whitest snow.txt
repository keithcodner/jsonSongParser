[Verse 1] 
Such love, Pure as the whitest snow; Such love, Weeps for the shame I know; Such love, Paying the debt I owe; O Jesus, such love.


[Verse 2] 
Such love, Stilling my restlessness; Such love, Filling my emptiness; Such love, Showing me holiness; O Jesus, such love.


[Verse 3] 
Such love, Springs from eternity; Such love, Streaming through history; Such love, Fountain of life to me; O Jesus, such love.
