[Verse 1] 
The head that once was crowned with thorns Is crowned with glory now; A royal diadem adorns The mighty Victor's brow.


[Verse 2] 
The highest place that heaven affords Is His by sovereign right, The King of kings, the Lord of Lords, And heaven's eternal light.


[Verse 3] 
The joy of all who dwell above, The joy of all below, To whom He manifests His love, And grants His name to know.


[Verse 4] 
To them the cross, with all its shame, With all its grace, is given; Their name an everlasting name, Their joy the joy of heaven.


[Verse 5] 
They suffer with their Lord below, They reign with Him above; Their profit and their joy to know The mystery of His love.


[Verse 6] 
The cross He bore is life and health, Though shame and death to Him; His people's hope, His people's wealth, Their everlasting theme.
