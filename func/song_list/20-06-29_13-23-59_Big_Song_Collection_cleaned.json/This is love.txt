[Verse 1] 
This is love, not that we loved Him, But that He first loved us. Left behind glories of heaven; Took on the shame of the cross. But in the place where love was poured Death could not hold our risen Lord.


[Verse 2] 
On Christ our solid ground, Our hope for life is found; The joy of our salvation. On Christ our solid ground, Our hope for life is found. There is no condemnation. There is no condemnation.


[Verse 3] 
This is peace, not as the world gives, But the true peace of Christ. You have claimed our hearts for heaven; Living by faith, not by sight. Strengthen our faith in You alone Until we stand before Your throne.


[Verse 4] 
On Christ our solid ground, Our hope for life is found; The joy of our salvation. On Christ our solid ground, Our hope for life is found. There is no condemnation. There is no condemnation.
