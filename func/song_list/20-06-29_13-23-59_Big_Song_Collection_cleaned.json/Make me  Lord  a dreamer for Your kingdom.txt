[Verse 1] 
Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom; Plant in my heart heavenly desires. Grant faith that can say, impossibilities shall be, And vision lest a world should perish not knowing Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom; I would aspire to greater goals in God. So cause faith to rise, to motivate each word and deed, A faith that's well convinced that Jesus meets every need.


[Verse 3] 
Make me, Lord, a dreamer for Your kingdom, Dreams that will change a world that's lost its way. May dreams that first found their birth in Your omnipotence, Come alive in me, becoming reality.
