[Verse 1] 
[F]How we gonna [G]work this [C/E]out? To fabricate a [F]God like [G]this, no [C/E]doubt, We'd end up worshipping a [F]Christ of our [G]own de[C/E]sign. But Jesus doesn't [F]fit that [G]profile; [F]His ways [G]aren't mine.


[Verse 2] 
[C]I'm not following a [G]God that's imagined. [C]Can't invent this Dei[G]ty. [C]That's why Jesus is the [G]final answer To [Em]who I want [C]my God to [D]be. He's [Em]who I want [C]my God to [D]be.
