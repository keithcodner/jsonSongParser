[Verse 1] 
Oh kneel me down again, Here at Your feet; Show me how much You love humility. Oh Spirit, be the star that leads me to The humble heart of love I see in You.


[Verse 2] 
You are the God of the broken, The friend of the weak; You wash the feet of the weary, Embrace the ones in need. I want to be like You, Jesus, To have this heart in me. You are the God of the humble, You are the humble King.
