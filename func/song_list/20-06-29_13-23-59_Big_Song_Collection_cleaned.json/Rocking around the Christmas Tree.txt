[Verse 1] 
Rocking around the Christmas Tree at the Christmas party hop Mistletoe hung where you can see Ev'ry couple tries to stop


[Verse 2] 
You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing "Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly"|| Rocking around the Christmas Tree Have a happy holiday Everyone's dancing merrily In a new old fashioned way


[Verse 3] 
Rocking around the Christmas Tree Let the Christmas Spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling


[Verse 4] 
You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing "Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly"|| Rocking around the Christmas Tree Have a happy holiday Everyone's dancing merrily In a new old fashioned way
