[Verse 1] 
Teach us, O Lord, what it really means To rend our hearts instead of outer things. And teach us, O God, what we do not see About our hearts and of Your ways. ||And Father deal with our carnal desires, To move in Your power, but not live the life, And to love our neighbour with all that we have, And keep our tongues from saying things we have not seen.


[Verse 2] 
O, break our hearts with the things that break Yours, If we sow in tears, we will reap in joy, That we might pass through Your refining fire, Where brokenness awaits on the other side.


[Verse 3] 
Raise up an army like Joel saw, Your church that is stronger than everbefore. They do not break ranks when they plunge through defences, But the fear of the Lord will be their wisdom. ||That they might weep as Jesus wept, A fountain of tears for the wounded and lost; Whoever heard of an army, O God, That conquered the earth by weeping, And mourning, and brokenness?


[Verse 4] 
O, break our hearts with the things that break Yours, If we sow in tears, we will reap in joy, That we might pass through Your refining fire, Where brokenness awaits on the other side.


[Verse 5] 
But there will be a day when the nations will bow And our Lord will be King over all the earth; And He will be the only One, And also His name will be the only One. 


[Verse 6] 
O, break our hearts with the things that break Yours, If we sow in tears, we will reap in joy, That we might pass through Your refining fire, Where brokenness awaits on the other side.
