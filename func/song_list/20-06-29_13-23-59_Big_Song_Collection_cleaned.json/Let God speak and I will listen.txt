[Verse 1] 
Let God speak and I will listen, Let God speak, there's things I'm needing to put right. Let God speak and I will obey what He says, Please God, I want to hear Your voice tonight.


[Verse 2] 
Lord I want to hear Your voice, Lord I want to hear Your voice, Lord I want to hear Your voice Tonight, tonight.
