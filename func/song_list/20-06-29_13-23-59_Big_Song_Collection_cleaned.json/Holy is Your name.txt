[Verse 1] 
Holy is Your name, Yeshua, my Deliverer. Worthy of all praise, You everliving God.


[Verse 2] 
Perfect are Your ways, Jehovah, my Father. Faithful is Your love, You gave Yourself for me.


[Verse 3] 
In You I have security; In You I put my trust. In You I have confidence, You meet my every need.
