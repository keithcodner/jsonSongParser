[Verse 1] 
We have come to seek Your face, Filled with wonder at Your grace, Amazed at how You've come And touched our lives. ||But even as we've felt Your touch, Desire for You has grown so much, It only serves to make us realise That the way ahead is in Your strength alone. So we stand before You now and we cry, 'Lord, lead us on!'


[Verse 2] 
'Cause after all You've brought us through, We find we're even more dependent on You, Not in power, not in might, But through Your Spirit's guiding light. ||We're driven by the things He says, And glory in our weaknesses, And knowing how we need You now, we come: Here we stand before You.


[Verse 3] 
And we will wait for You, wait for You; Show us, Lord, what You would have us do. We will wait for You, wait for You; Show us, Lord, what You would have us do.
