[Verse 1] 
Lord, Your name is wonderful, At Your name the captives shall go free. We declare the mighty name of Jesus, And proclaim Your holy victory.


[Verse 2] 
At Your name the kingdoms fall; We declare You Lord of all. At Your name the enemy shall flee, You are mighty, You are mighty Lord of all. Mighty Lord of all.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, Your name is wonderful, At Your name the captives shall go free. We declare the mighty name of Jesus, And proclaim Your holy victory.


[Verse 4] 
At Your name the kingdoms fall; We declare You Lord of all. At Your name the enemy shall flee, You are mighty, You are mighty Lord of all. Mighty Lord of all. Mighty Lord of all!
