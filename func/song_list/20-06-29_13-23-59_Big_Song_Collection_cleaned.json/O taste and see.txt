[Verse 1] 
O taste and see that the Lord is good. O taste and see that the Lord is good.


[Verse 2] 
He is a mighty God, His ways are higher than ours; There's nothing impossible for Him. The future is in His hands. We're a part of His perfect plan, And we can do all things Through the power of His love.
