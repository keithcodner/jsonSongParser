[Verse 1] 
Here I am, humbled by Your majesty, Covered by Your grace so free. Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man, Covered by the blood of the Lamb. Now I’ve found the greatest Love of all is mine, Since You laid down Your life, The greatest sacrifice.


[Verse 2] 
Majesty, majesty. Your grace has found me just as I am, Empty handed but a live in Your hands. Majesty, majesty, Forever I am changed by Your love, In the presence of Your majesty.


[Verse 3] 
Here I am, humbled by the love that you give, Forgiven so that I can forgive. Here I stand, knowing that I'm Your desire, Sanctified by glory and fire. Now I've found the greatest Love of all is mine, Since You laid down Your life, The greatest sacrifice.


[Verse 4] 
Majesty, majesty. Your grace has found me just as I am, Empty handed but a live in Your hands. Majesty, majesty, Forever I am changed by Your love, In the presence of Your majesty.


[Verse 5] 
Here I am.
