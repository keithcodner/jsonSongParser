[Verse 1] 
Make way, make way, For Christ the King In splendour arrives. Fling wide the gates And welcome Him Into your lives.


[Verse 2] 
Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) For the King of kings. (For the King of kings.) Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) And let His kingdom in.


[Verse 3] 
He comes the broken Hearts to heal, The prisoners to free. The deaf shall hear, The lame shall dance, The blind shall see.


[Verse 4] 
Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) For the King of kings. (For the King of kings.) Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) And let His kingdom in.


[Verse 5] 
And those who mourn With heavy hearts, Who weep and sigh; With laughter, Joy and royal crown He'll beautify.


[Verse 6] 
Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) For the King of kings. (For the King of kings.) Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) And let His kingdom in.


[Verse 7] 
We call you now To worship Him As Lord of all. To have no Gods before Him, Their thrones must fall! 


[Verse 8] 
Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) For the King of kings. (For the King of kings.) Make way! (Make way!) Make way! (Make way!) And let His kingdom in.
