[Verse 1] 
In mystery reigning, king over all, Hear angels proclaiming, Jesus is Lord. To each generation Your love is the same; Wonderful Saviour, we worship Your name.


[Verse 2] 
A beauty that's timeless, who can compare? All earth stands in silence, when You appear. Your kingdom is boundless, Your love without end; Wonder of wonders, this King is my friend!


[Verse 3] 
All power has been given into Your hands; Through blood and by suffering You now command. And no opposition can stand in Your light; Crowned King of heaven, we kneel at the sight.
