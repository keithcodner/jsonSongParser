[Verse 1] 
O Lord, You're great, You are fabulous, We love You more than Any words can sing, sing, sing. O Lord, You're great, You are so generous, You lavish us with gifts When we don't deserve a thing.


[Verse 2] 
Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord. Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
O Lord, You're great, You are so powerful, You hold the mighty universe In Your hand, hand, hand. O Lord, You're great, You are so beautiful, You've poured out Your love On this undeserving land. 


[Verse 4] 
Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord. Allelu, alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord. Alleluia, praise You, Lord.
