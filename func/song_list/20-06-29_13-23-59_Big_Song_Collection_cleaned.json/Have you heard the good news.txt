[Verse 1] 
Have you heard the good news? Have you heard the good news? We can live in hope Because of what the Lord has done. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
There is a way When there seems to be no way, There is a light in the darkness: There is a hope, An everlasting hope, There is a God who can help us.


[Verse 3] 
Have you heard the good news? Have you heard the good news? We can live in hope Because of what the Lord has done. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
A hope for justice And a hope for peace, A hope for those in desperation: We have a future, If only we believe He works in every situation. 


[Verse 5] 
Have you heard the good news? Have you heard the good news? We can live in hope Because of what the Lord has done. (Repeat)
