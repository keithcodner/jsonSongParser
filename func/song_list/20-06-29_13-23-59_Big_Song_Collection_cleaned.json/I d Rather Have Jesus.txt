[Verse 1] 
I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/G]silver or [Bb]gold; I'd [Bb]rather be [Bb/D]His than have [F/C]riches [Bb]un[F]told; I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/G]houses or [Bb]lands. I'd [Bb]rather be [Bb/E]led by His [Bb/G]nail-[F]pierced [Bb]hand.


[Verse 2] 
Than to [F/C]be the [F]king of a [Gm]vast do[Bb]main And be [F/C]held in [F]sin's dread [Eb/Bb]sway[Bb]. I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/Bb]any[Bb]thing This [Bb/F]world af[F]fords to[Eb/Bb]day.[Bb]


[Verse 3] 
I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/G]men's ap[Bb]plause; I'd [Bb]rather be faith[Bb/D]ful to [F/C]His [Bb]dear [F]cause; I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/G]world-wide [Bb]fame. I'd [Bb]rather be [Bb/E]true to His [Bb/G]ho[F]ly [Bb]name.


[Verse 4] 
Than to [F/C]be the [F]king of a [Gm]vast do[Bb]main And be [F/C]held in [F]sin's dread [Eb/Bb]sway[Bb]. I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/Bb]any[Bb]thing This [Bb/F]world af[F]fords to[Eb/Bb]day.[Bb]


[Verse 5] 
He's [Bb]fairer than lilies of [Eb/G]rarest [Bb]bloom; He's [Bb]sweeter than ho[Bb/D]ney from [F/C]out [Bb]the [F]comb; He's [Bb]all that my hungering [Eb/G]spirit [Bb]needs. I'd [Bb]rather have Je[Bb/E]sus and [Bb/G]let [F]Him [Bb]lead.


[Verse 6] 
Than to [F/C]be the [F]king of a [Gm]vast do[Bb]main And be [F/C]held in [F]sin's dread [Eb/Bb]sway[Bb]. I'd [Bb]rather have Jesus than [Eb/Bb]any[Bb]thing This [Bb/F]world af[F]fords to[Eb/Bb]day.[Bb]
