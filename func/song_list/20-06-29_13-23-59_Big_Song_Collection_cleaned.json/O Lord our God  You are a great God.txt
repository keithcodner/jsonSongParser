[Verse 1] 
O Lord our God, You are a great God, Your majesty beyond compare. Who is a God like unto You, And who like me could know Your care?


[Verse 2] 
It's good, dear Lord, to know Your greatness, It's good, dear Lord, to know Your care. It's good just to be in Your presence, It's good just to know that You are there.
