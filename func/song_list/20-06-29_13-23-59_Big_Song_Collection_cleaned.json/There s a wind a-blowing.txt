[Verse 1] 
There's a wind a-blowing All across the land; Fragrant breeze of heaven Blowing once again. Don't know where it comes from, Don't know where it goes, But let it blow over me. Oh, sweet wind, Come and blow over me.


[Verse 2] 
There's a rain a-pouring, Showers from above; Mercy drops are coming, Mercy drops of love. Turn your face to heaven, Let the water pour, Well, let it pour over me. Oh, sweet rain, Come and pour over me.


[Verse 3] 
There's a fire burning, Falling from the sky; Awesome tongues of fire, Consuming you and I. Can you feel it burning, Burn the sacrifice? Well, let it burn over me. Oh, sweet fire, Come and burn over me.
