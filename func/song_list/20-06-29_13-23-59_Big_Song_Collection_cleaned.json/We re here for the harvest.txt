[Verse 1] 
We're here for the harvest, Get ready to reap, The call is for action, It's not time to sleep. We're here for the harvest, The yield will be great; The fields are now ripened, So don't hesitate.


[Verse 2] 
There's need for more labourers, For many, not few, The challenge set before us Is who? And we cry: Lord of the harvest, In this day of Your power, Hear the anthem of voices: 'send me!'


[Verse 3] 
Send me, send me, Lord of the harvest, send me! Send me, send me, Lord of the harvest, send me!


[Verse 4] 
The Spirit is upon us, To cause the blind to see; The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord To set the captive free. The homeless and the needy Can no longer be ignored, And all oppressed will celebrate The favour of the Lord. 


[Verse 5] 
There's need for more labourers, For many, not few, The challenge set before us Is who? And we cry: Lord of the harvest, In this day of Your power, Hear the anthem of voices: 'send me!'


[Verse 6] 
Send me, send me, Lord of the harvest, send me! Send me, send me, Lord of the harvest, send me!
