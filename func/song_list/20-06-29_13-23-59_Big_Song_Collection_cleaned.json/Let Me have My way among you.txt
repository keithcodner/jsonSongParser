[Verse 1] 
Let Me have My way among you, Do not strive, do not strive. Let Me have My way among you, Do not strive, do not strive. ||For Mine is the power and the glory For ever and ever the same. Let Me have My way among you, Do not strive, do not strive.


[Verse 2] 
We'll let You have Your way among us, We'll not strive, we'll not strive. We'll let You have Your way among us, We'll not strive, we'll not strive. ||For Yours is the power and the glory For ever and ever the same. We'll let You have Your way among us, We'll not strive, we'll not strive.


[Verse 3] 
Let My peace rule within your hearts, Do not strive, do not strive. Let My peace rule within your hearts, Do not strive, do not strive. ||For Mine is the power and the glory, For ever and ever the same. Let My peace rule within your hearts, Do not strive, do not strive.


[Verse 4] 
We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts, We'll not strive, we'll not strive. We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts, We'll not strive, we'll not strive. ||For Yours is the power and the glory, For ever and ever the same. We'll let Your peace rule within our hearts, We'll not strive, we'll not strive.
