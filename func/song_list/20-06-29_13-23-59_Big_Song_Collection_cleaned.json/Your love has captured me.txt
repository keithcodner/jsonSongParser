[Verse 1] 
Your love has captured me, Your grace has set me free; Your life, the air I breathe: Be glorified in me.


[Verse 2] 
You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire, In the presence of a thousand kings You are my one desire. And I stand before You now With trembling hands lifted high, Be glorified.
