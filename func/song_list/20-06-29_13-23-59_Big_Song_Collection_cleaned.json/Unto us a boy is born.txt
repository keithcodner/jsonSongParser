[Verse 1] 
Unto us a boy is born! King of all creation, Came He to a world forlorn, The Lord of every nation, The Lord of every nation.


[Verse 2] 
Cradled in a stall was He With sleepy cows and asses; But the very beasts could see That He all men surpasses, That He all men surpasses.


[Verse 3] 
Herod then with fear was filled: 'A Prince,' he said, 'in Jewry!' All the little boys he killed At Bethlem in his fury, At Bethlem in his fury.


[Verse 4] 
Now may Mary's Son who came So long ago to love us, Lead us all with hearts aflame Unto the joys above us, Unto the joys above us.


[Verse 5] 
Alpha and Omega He! Let the organ thunder, While the choir with peals of glee Doth rend the air asunder, Doth rend the air asunder!
