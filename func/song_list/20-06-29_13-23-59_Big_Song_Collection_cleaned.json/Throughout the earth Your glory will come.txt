[Verse 1] 
Throughout the earth Your glory will come, A day of power, of salvation. To thirsty hearts Your rivers will run, Changing lives for the glory of God. ||From Satan's hold this land will be free, The deaf will hear, the blind will see; To walk in truth, in victory, To live for the glory of God.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, come and reign by the power of Your Spirit, Shower this land with Your rivers oflife, That Jesus the Son would be glorified Within the heart of Your Bride, Lord, come and reign.


[Verse 3] 
Upon the earth may Your kingdom come, Within our lives may Your will be done; Under the reign of Jesus the Son We will live for the glory of God. ||The gates of heaven are open wide, To bless this land, to turn back the tide, To welcome in Your glorious Bride, To live for the glory of God. 


[Verse 4] 
Lord, come and reign by the power of Your Spirit, Shower this land with Your rivers oflife, That Jesus the Son would be glorified Within the heart of Your Bride, Lord, come and reign.
