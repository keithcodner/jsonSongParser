[Verse 1] 
Hungry, I come to You, For I know You satisfy. I am empty, but I know Your love does not run dry. So I wait for You, So I wait for You.


[Verse 2] 
I'm falling on my knees, Offering all of me. Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.


[Verse 3] 
Broken, I run to You, For Your arms are open wide; I am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life. So I wait for You, So I wait for You.


[Verse 4] 
I'm falling on my knees, Offering all of me. Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.
