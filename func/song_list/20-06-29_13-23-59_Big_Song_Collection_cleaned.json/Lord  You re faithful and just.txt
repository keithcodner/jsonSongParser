[Verse 1] 
Lord, You're faithful and just, In You I put my trust, mighty God, Everlasting Father. Your word is faithful and true, What You promised You will do, oh Lord. Your word endures for ever.


[Verse 2] 
You're faithful, faithful, and Your mercy never ends; The world will pass away, but Your words are here to stay. You're wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God. Lord Jehovah, You are the great I AM.
