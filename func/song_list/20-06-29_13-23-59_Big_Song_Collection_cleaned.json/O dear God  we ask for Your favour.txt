[Verse 1] 
O dear God, we ask for Your favour, Come and sweep through this place. Oh, we desire You. I just want to be with You, be where You are, Dwell in Your presence, O God. Oh, I want to walk with You. 


[Verse 2] 
And I will climb this mountain, And I step off the shore; And I have chosen to follow, And be by Your side forevermore. 


[Verse 3] 
Tell me what You want me to do, Lord God, Tell me what You want for my life. It's Yours, O God, it's Yours. Do Your will, have Your way, Be Lord God in this place. Oh, I want Your will to be done. 


[Verse 4] 
And I will climb this mountain, And I step off the shore; And I have chosen to follow, And be by Your side forevermore.
