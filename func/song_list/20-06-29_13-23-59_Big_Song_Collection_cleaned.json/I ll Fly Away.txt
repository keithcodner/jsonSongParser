[Verse 1] 
[G]Some glad morning when this life is o’er, [C]I’ll fly a[G]way! [G]To a home on God’s celestial shore, [G]I’ll [D]fly a[G]way.


[Verse 2] 
[G]I’ll fly away, oh glory, [C]I’ll fly a[G]way; [G]When I die, hallelujah by and [Em]by, [G]I’ll [D]fly a[G]way.


[Verse 3] 
[G]When the shadows of this life have gone, [C]I’ll fly a[G]way! [G]Like a bird from prison bars has flown, [G]I’ll [D]fly a[G]way.


[Verse 4] 
[G]I’ll fly away, oh glory, [C]I’ll fly a[G]way; [G]When I die, hallelujah by and [Em]by, [G]I’ll [D]fly a[G]way.


[Verse 5] 
[G]Just a few more weary days and then, [C]I’ll fly a[G]way! [G]To a land where joys shall never end, [G]I’ll [D]fly a[G]way.


[Verse 6] 
[G]I’ll fly away, oh glory, [C]I’ll fly a[G]way; [G]When I die, hallelujah by and [Em]by, [G]I’ll [D]fly a[G]way.
