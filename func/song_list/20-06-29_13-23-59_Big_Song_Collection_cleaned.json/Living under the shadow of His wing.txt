[Verse 1] 
Living under the shadow of His wing We find security. Standing in His presence we will bring Our worship, worship, worship to the King.


[Verse 2] 
Bowed in adoration at His feet We dwell in harmony. Voices joined together that repeat, Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lamb.


[Verse 3] 
Heart to heart embracing in His love Reveals His purity. Soaring in my spirit like a dove, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
