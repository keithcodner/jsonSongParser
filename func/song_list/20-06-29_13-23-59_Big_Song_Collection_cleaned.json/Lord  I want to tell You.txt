[Verse 1] 
Lord, I want to tell You How much I love You; Your tenderness and mercy Have overwhelmed my heart. Let my whole life be An overflow of worship: All I have and all I am I give back, Lord, to You.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, I want to tell You My heart's desire, The love You've put within me Will burn with holy fire. Let my actions spring From an overflow of worship: All I have and all I am I gladly give back to You.
