[Verse 1] 
I come as I am, Baring all of my shame. Surround me with love And acceptance again. 


[Verse 2] 
Come closer, Lord, Come and restore; Come closer, Lord. 


[Verse 3] 
Nothing I bring Is too great to forgive, Though each time Your grace Is betrayed by my sin.


[Verse 4] 
Come closer, Lord, Come and restore; Come closer, Lord.
