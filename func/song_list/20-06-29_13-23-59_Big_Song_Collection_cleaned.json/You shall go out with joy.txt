[Verse 1] 
You shall go out with joy And be led forth with peace, And the mountains and the hills Shall break forth before you. There'll be shouts of joy, And the trees of the field Shall clap, shall clap their hands.


[Verse 2] 
And the trees of the field Shall clap their hands, And the trees of the field Shall clap their hands, And the trees of the field Shall clap their hands, And you'll go out with joy.
