[Verse 1] 
Not unto us, but unto Your name Be glory, honour and praise. Not unto us, but unto Your name Be glory, honour and praise.


[Verse 2] 
Yours is the greatness and power. You alone deserve all the fame. Yours is the splendour and majesty. From everlasting You're the same.


[Verse 3] 
Not unto us, but unto Your name Be glory, honour and praise. Not unto us, but unto Your name Be glory, honour and praise.


[Verse 4] 
Yours is the glorious kingdom. You alone are the King over all. The earth is under Your dominion now. You say when nations rise or fall. 


[Verse 5] 
Not unto us, but unto Your name Be glory, honour and praise. Not unto us, but unto Your name Be glory, honour and praise.
