[Verse 1] 
King of love, praise You, King of love, worship You, King of love, thank You, I'm treasure in Your eyes.


[Verse 2] 
I know my heart will love You forever, I know Your word, I'll always be Your child. I know my soul is safe for eternity 'Cause You hold me close in Your arms.


[Verse 3] 
King of love, praise You, King of love, worship You, King of love, thank You, I'm treasure in Your eyes.


[Verse 4] 
Gonna give You all the praise I can, Gonna give You all the thanks I can. In Your arms I will be, King of love, holding me. Gonna give You all the love I can, Gonna give You all the praise I can. King of love, King of love, I worship You.


[Verse 5] 
King of love, praise You, King of love, worship You, King of love, thank You, I'm treasure in Your eyes.
