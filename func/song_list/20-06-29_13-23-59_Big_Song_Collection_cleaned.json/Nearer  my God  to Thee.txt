[Verse 1] 
Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee: E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me, Still all my song would be, Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Though, like the wanderer, The sun gone down, Darkness be over me, My rest a stone, Yet in my dreams I'd be Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.


[Verse 3] 
There let the way appear, Steps up to heaven; All that Thou sendest me, In mercy given; Angels to beckon me Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.


[Verse 4] 
Then, with my waking thoughts Bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise; So by my woes to be Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Or, if on joyful wing Cleaving the sky, Sun, moon, and stars forgot, Upwards I fly, Still all my song shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee.
