[Verse 1] 
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds In a believer's ear! It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, And drives away his fear.


[Verse 2] 
It makes the wounded spirit whole, And calms the troubled breast; 'Tis manna to the hungry soul, And to the weary, rest.


[Verse 3] 
Dear name, the rock on which I build, My shield and hiding place, My never-failing treasury, filled With boundless stores of grace!


[Verse 4] 
Jesus! My Shepherd, Saviour, Friend, My Prophet, Priest and King, My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, Accept the praise I bring.


[Verse 5] 
Weak is the effort of my heart, And cold my warmest thought; But when I see Thee as Thou art, I'll praise Thee as I ought.


[Verse 6] 
Till then I would Thy love proclaim With every fleeting breath; And may the music of Thy name Refresh my soul in death.
