[Verse 1] 
Lift Him up, lift Him high, Let His praises fill the sky. Oh, heaven's gates are open wide To those who hear the call. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Through every generation This truth will always shine, That Christ came down among us, Now He is glorified.


[Verse 3] 
Lift Him up, lift Him high, Let His praises fill the sky. Oh, heaven's gates are open wide To those who hear the call. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
The message of the kingdom Stands unshakeable through time: That man can be forgiven, If you seek then you will find. 


[Verse 5] 
Lift Him up, lift Him high, Let His praises fill the sky. Oh, heaven's gates are open wide To those who hear the call. (Repeat)
