[Verse 1] 
Here is bread, here is wine, Christ is with us - He is with us; Break the bread, drink the wine - Christ is with us here.


[Verse 2] 
Here is grace, here is peace, Christ is with us - He is with us; Know His grace, find His peace - Feast on Jesus here.


[Verse 3] 
In this bread there is healing, In this cup there's life forever; In this moment, by the Spirit Christ is with us here.


[Verse 4] 
Here we are, joined in one, Christ is with us - He is with us; We'll proclaim, till He comes - Jesus crucified. 


[Verse 5] 
In this bread there is healing, In this cup there's life forever; In this moment, by the Spirit Christ is with us here.
