[Verse 1] 
The world is looking for a hero; We know the greatest One of all: The mighty Ruler of the nations, King of kings and Lord of Lords; Who took the nature of a servant, And gave His life to save us all.


[Verse 2] 
We will raise a shout, We will shout it out, He is the Champion of the world. We will raise a shout, We will shout it out, He is the Champion of the world.


[Verse 3] 
The Lord Almighty is our hero, He breaks the stranglehold of sin. Through Jesus' love we fear no evil; Powers of darkness flee from Him. His light will shine in every nation, A sword of justice He will bring. 


[Verse 4] 
We will raise a shout, We will shout it out, He is the Champion of the world. We will raise a shout, We will shout it out, He is the Champion of the world.
