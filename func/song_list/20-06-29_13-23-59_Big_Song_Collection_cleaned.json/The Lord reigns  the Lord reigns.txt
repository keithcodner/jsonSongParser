[Verse 1] 
The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns, The Lord reigns, Let the earth rejoice, let the earth rejoice, Let the earth rejoice. Let the people be glad That our God reigns.


[Verse 2] 
A fire goes before Him And burns up all His enemies; The hills melt like wax At the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns, The Lord reigns, Let the earth rejoice, let the earth rejoice, Let the earth rejoice. Let the people be glad That our God reigns.


[Verse 4] 
The heavens declare His righteousness, The peoples see His glory; For You, O Lord, are exalted Over all the earth, Over all the earth. 


[Verse 5] 
The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns, The Lord reigns, Let the earth rejoice, let the earth rejoice, Let the earth rejoice. Let the people be glad That our God reigns.
