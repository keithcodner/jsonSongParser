[Verse 1] 
You are forever in my life, You see me through the seasons; Cover me with Your hand, And lead me in Your righteousness. And I look to You, And I wait on You.


[Verse 2] 
I'll sing to You, Lord, a hymn of love For Your faithfulness to me. I'm carried in everlasting arms; You'll never let me go, Through it all.


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, hallelujah.


[Verse 4] 
I'll sing to You, Lord, a hymn of love For Your faithfulness to me. I'm carried in everlasting arms; You'll never let me go, Through it all.
