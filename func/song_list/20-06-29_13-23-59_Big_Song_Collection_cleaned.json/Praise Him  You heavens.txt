[Verse 1] 
Praise Him, You heavens And all that's above. Praise Him, you angels And heavenly hosts. Let the whole earth praise Him. ||Praise Him, the sun, moon And bright shining stars. Praise Him, you heavens And waters and skies. Let the whole earth praise Him.


[Verse 2] 
Great in power, great in glory, Great in mercy, King of heaven. Great in battle, great in wonder, Great in Zion, King over all the earth.
