[Verse 1] 
O God of love, I come to You again, Knowing I'll find mercy. I can't explain all the things I see, But I'll trust in You. ||In every moment You are there, Watching over, You hear my prayer. You go before me, You're behind me, Nothing's hidden from You.


[Verse 2] 
How good it is to be loved by You, How good it is. How good it is to be loved by You, How good it is.


[Verse 3] 
O God of strength, Your hand is on my life, Bringing peace to me. You know my frame, You know how I am made, You planned all my days. ||Hand of mercy, hand of love, Giving power to overcome. If all beneath me falls away, I know that You are God.


[Verse 4] 
How good it is to be loved by You, How good it is. How good it is to be loved by You, How good it is.


[Verse 5] 
Who can stand against us? In my weakness You are strong. Your word is everlasting, I will praise You, faithful One.


[Verse 6] 
How good it is to be loved by You, How good it is. How good it is to be loved by You, How good it is.
