[Verse 1] 
In every circumstance of life You are with me, glorious Father. And I have put my trust in You, That I may know the glorious hope To which I'm called. ||And by the power that works in me, You've raised me up and set me free; And now in every circumstance I'll prove Your love without a doubt, Your joy shall be my strength, Your joy shall be my strength.
