[Verse 1] 
I live my life to worship You, I spend my days serving You, And now I come, I come. I want to spend some time with You, To steal away and be with You, So now I come, I come.


[Verse 2] 
Just to be with You, Just to know more of Your love; Just to be with You, And to love You.


[Verse 3] 
And here You know me, And here You know me, And here You know me, And here I love You.


[Verse 4] 
Just to be with You, Just to know more of Your love; Just to be with You, And to love You.
