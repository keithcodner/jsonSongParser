[Verse 1] 
 You surrounded me with songs of praise You have brought me to this place|| Where Your love and grace move within my life Now your message is my light


[Verse 2] 
 Your love is beautiful Your love is beautiful It's the reason why I sing


[Verse 3] 
 All around the world let the praise begin All around the world let the praise begin


[Verse 4]

[Verse 5] 
 I am planted here by the waters end And I living for the King|| I have found my peace in the house of God This is where I'm meant to be


[Verse 6] 
 Your love is beautiful Your love is beautiful It's the reason why I sing


[Verse 7] 
 All around the world let the praise begin All around the world let the praise begin


[Verse 8] 
 All around the world let the praise begin All around the world let the praise begin
