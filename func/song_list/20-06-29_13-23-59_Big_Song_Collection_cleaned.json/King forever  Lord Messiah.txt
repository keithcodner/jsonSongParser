[Verse 1] 
King forever, Lord Messiah, He who was, and is, and is to come; Prince of glory, name of Jesus, Be Your praise and worship ever sung.


[Verse 2] 
And we will sing hosanna to Jesus, We exalt and raise Your name above; And we proclaim the glory of Jesus, Prince of Peace, and worthy King of love.


[Verse 3] 
Lord anointed, our salvation, He whom angels call the Word of God; True and faithful, Lamb of mercy, Now receive our worship and our love. 


[Verse 4] 
And we will sing hosanna to Jesus, We exalt and raise Your name above; And we proclaim the glory of Jesus, Prince of Peace, and worthy King of love.
