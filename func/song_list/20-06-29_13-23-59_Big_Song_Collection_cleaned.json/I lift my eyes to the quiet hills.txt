[Verse 1] 
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills, In the press of a busy day; As green hills stand in a dusty land, So God is my strength and stay.


[Verse 2] 
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills, To a calm that is mine to share; Secure and still in the Father's will, And kept by the Father's care.


[Verse 3] 
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills, With a prayer as I turn to sleep; By day, by night, Through the dark and light, My Shepherd will guard His sheep.


[Verse 4] 
I lift my eyes to the quiet hills, And my heart to the Father's throne; In all my ways to the end of days, The Lord will preserve His own.
