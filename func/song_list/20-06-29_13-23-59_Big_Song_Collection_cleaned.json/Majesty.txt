Rising I feel my heart sing His praises our Lord and King|| The wonder, the majesty Welcome the King of Glory in 


[Verse 2] 
Every tribe and tongue Every land will sing Your praise || To the end of time we sing Majesty

All majesty To the God of creation|| All majesty God of all generations || This anthem we sing To the God of all nations|| All majesty We sing 


[Verse 4]
