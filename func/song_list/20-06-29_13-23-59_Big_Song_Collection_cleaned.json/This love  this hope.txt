[Verse 1] 
This love, this hope, This peace of God, this righteousness, This faith, this joy, This life complete in me.


[Verse 2] 
Now healed and whole, And risen in His righteousness, I live in Him, He lives in me, And filled with this hope in God, Reflecting His glory.


[Verse 3] 
Now is the time to worship You, Now is the time to offer You All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans; I lay it down. Now is the time to live for You, Now is the time I'm found in You. Now is the time Your kingdom comes.
