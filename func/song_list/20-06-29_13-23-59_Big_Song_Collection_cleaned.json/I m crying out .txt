[Verse 1] 
I'm crying out, let everybody hear This message loud and clear. I'm crying out, I want the world to know That Jesus is my hope.


[Verse 2] 
I've chosen to believe That God has chosen me Now at this time. He turned my life around, I make a different sound, Now I want to be a sign. ||Harvest fields are white, Wanna do what's right, Can't keep it to myself, Gotta go, gotta tell everyone, yeah.
