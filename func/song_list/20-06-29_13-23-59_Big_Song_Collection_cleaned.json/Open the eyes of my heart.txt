[Verse 1] 
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see You, I want to see You. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
To see You high and lifted up, Shining in the light of Your glory. Pour out Your power and love, As we sing holy, holy, holy.


[Verse 3] 
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see You, I want to see You. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
To see You high and lifted up, Shining in the light of Your glory. Pour out Your power and love, As we sing holy, holy, holy.


[Verse 5] 
Holy, holy, holy, Holy, holy,holy, Holy holy holy, I want to see You.
