[Verse 1] 
I don't want to be a Pharisee Or anyone like that. It's stupid swallowing camels Whilst straining out a gnat. To keep the letter of the law, They forgot the people it was for.


[Verse 2] 
So I don't want to be a Pharisee, I don't want to be a Pharisee, I don't want to be a Pharisee Or anyone like that.
