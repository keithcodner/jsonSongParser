[Verse 1] 
I will never be the same, Now that I have seen the cross; And how You took upon Yourself The fullness of the wrath of God. And I may never understand Just what You suffered in my place; Jesus, You who knew no sin, How You were made sin for us.


[Verse 2] 
And oh, how fierce the Father's anger. And though You were pierced, All the pain could not compare; So dark was the hour, When all heaven turned its face away, Turned its face away from You. But how sweet is Your mercy As it finds its way to me.
