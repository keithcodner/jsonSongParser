[Verse 1] 
O God beyond all praising, We worship You today, And sing the love amazing That songs cannot repay; ||For we can only wonder At every gift you send, At blessings without number And mercies without end: We lift our hearts before You And wait upon Your word, We honour and adore You, Our great and mighty Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Then hear, O gracious Saviour, Accept the love we bring, That we who know Your favour May serve You as our King; ||And whether our tomorrows Be filled with good or ill, We'll triumph through our sorrows And rise to bless You still: To marvel at Your beauty And glory in Your ways, And make a joyful duty Our sacrifice of praise!
