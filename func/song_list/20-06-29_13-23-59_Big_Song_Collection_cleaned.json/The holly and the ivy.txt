[Verse 1] 
The holly and the ivy, When they are both full grown Of all the trees that are in the wood The holly bears the crown O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir


[Verse 2] 
The holly bears a blossom As white as lily flower And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ To be our sweet Saviour O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir


[Verse 3] 
The holly bears a berry As red as any blood And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ To do poor sinners good O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir


[Verse 4] 
The holly bears a prickle As sharp as any thorn; And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ On Christmas Day in the morn. O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir


[Verse 5] 
The holly bears a bark As bitter as any gall; And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ For to redeem us all. O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir


[Verse 6] 
The holly and the ivy Now both are full well grown, Of all the trees that are in the wood, The holly bears the crown. O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir 


[Verse 7] 
The holly and the ivy, When they are both full grown Of all the trees that are in the wood The holly bears the crown O the rising of the sun And the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing of the choir
