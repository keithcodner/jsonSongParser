[Verse 1] 
There's a calling to the nations To make ready in Your name, To take up the yoke of Jesus And proclaim the coming day. There's a pouring of Your Spirit As our old men dream Your dreams; Prophesy through sons and daughters, Come envision us again. 


[Verse 2] 
You're the Word and the Word is Truth, You're the Promise that was born in You, And a wave of expectation fills my soul! 


[Verse 3] 
All over the world we're singing, All over the world there's praise To the King of our salvation, And the Author of our faith. All over the world we're dancing, All over the world there's joy, We've called upon Your name And we are saved.


[Verse 4] 
Can it be this generation That will hear revival's song, As Your Spirit of creation Comes awakening the lost? Let the four winds blow Your justice, Come and harvest of the earth; Turn our mourning into dancing As we herald Your return.


[Verse 5] 
All over the world we're singing, All over the world there's praise To the King of our salvation, And the Author of our faith. All over the world we're dancing, All over the world there's joy, We've called upon Your name And we are saved.
