[Verse 1] 
Your only [D]Son,[G] no sin to [D]hide; but You have [Bm]sent[G] Him from Your [A]side, To walk u[G]pon[A] this guilty [Bm]sod[G] and to be[D]come the [A]Lamb of [D]God.


[Verse 2] 
Your Gift of [D]Love[G] they cruci[D]fied; they laughed and [Bm]scorned[G] Him as He [A]died; The humble [G]King,[A] they named a [Bm]fraud[G]|and sacri[D]ficed the [A]Lamb of [D]God.


[Verse 3] 
O Lamb of [Bm]God, [G]sweet Lamb of [D]God; I love the [Bm]holy [G]Lamb of [A]God; O wash me [G]in [A]His precious [Bm]blood;[G] My Jesus [D]Christ, the [A]Lamb of [D]God.


[Verse 4] 
I was so [D]lost[G] I should have [D]died but You have [Bm]brought[G] me to Your [A]side, To be led [G]by[A] Your staff and [Bm]rod[G] and to be [D]called a [A]lamb of [D]God.


[Verse 5] 
O Lamb of [Bm]God, [G]sweet Lamb of [D]God; I love the [Bm]holy [G]Lamb of [A]God; O wash me [G]in [A]His precious [Bm]blood;[G] My Jesus [D]Christ, the [A]Lamb of [D]God.
