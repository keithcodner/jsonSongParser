[Verse 1] 
One thing I have been asking, One thing I am looking for: To see Your glory and beauty, To know Your presence, Lord.


[Verse 2] 
You're the desire of my heart, And You are all that I want; You're the desire of my heart, And You are all that I want.


[Verse 3] 
You have all my attention, You are the One I'm living for; In You I find satisfaction, You are mine and I am Yours.


[Verse 4] 
You're the desire of my heart, And You are all that I want; You're the desire of my heart, And You are all that I want.


[Verse 5] 
I am wanting You, I am needing You much more, Lord. You have won my heart, You've given me all that You've got, Your love was demonstrated on the cross. Thank You, Lord!


[Verse 6] 
You're the desire of my heart, And You are all that I want; You're the desire of my heart, And You are all that I want.
