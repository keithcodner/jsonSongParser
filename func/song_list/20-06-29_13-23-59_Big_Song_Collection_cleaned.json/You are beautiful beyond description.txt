[Verse 1] 
You are beautiful beyond description, Too marvellous for words, Too wonderful for comprehension, Like nothing ever seen or heard. ||Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom? Who can fathom the depth of Your love? You are beautiful beyond description, Majesty, enthroned above.


[Verse 2] 
And I stand, I stand in awe of You. I stand, I stand in awe of You. Holy God, to whom all praise is due, I stand in awe of You.
