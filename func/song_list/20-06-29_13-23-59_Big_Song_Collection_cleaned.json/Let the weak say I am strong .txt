[Verse 1] 
Let the weak say I am strong, Let the poor say I am rich, Let the blind say I can see, It's what the Lord has done in me. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Hosanna, hosanna To the Lamb that was slain; Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.


[Verse 3] 
Into the river I will wade, There my sins are washed away; From the heavens mercy streams Of the Saviour's love for me.


[Verse 4] 
Hosanna, hosanna To the Lamb that was slain; Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.


[Verse 5] 
I will rise from waters deep Into the saving arms of God; I will sing salvation songs: Jesus Christ has set me free.


[Verse 6] 
Hosanna, hosanna To the Lamb that was slain; Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.
