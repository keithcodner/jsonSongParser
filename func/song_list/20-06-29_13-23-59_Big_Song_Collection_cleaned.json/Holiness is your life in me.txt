[Verse 1] 
Holiness is your life in me, Making me clean through Your blood. Holiness is Your fire in me, Purging my heart like a flood. I know You are perfect in holiness. Your life in me, setting me free, Making me holy.


[Verse 2] 
Only the blood of Jesus covers all of my sin. Only the life of Jesus renews me from within. ||Your blood is enough, Your mercy complete. Your work of atonement, paid for my debts, Making me holy. Only the blood of Jesus.
