[Verse 1] 
Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory. Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, I give my life to You, And trust Your holy name; Help me grow in holiness, And follow You in all Your ways. Send Your Holy Spirit, That I may truly be Cleansed within my heart And free from all impurity.


[Verse 3] 
Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory. Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory.


[Verse 4] 
O Lord, as we come trusting our way to You, Make our righteousness shine like the dawn.


[Verse 5] 
Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory. Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory.


[Verse 6] 
Teach me, Lord, to listen To the calling of Your Spirit, Helping me and guiding me To live my life as Jesus did. I long to know Your power And see the sick get healed; Come and move among us, Lord, That truth will be revealed. 


[Verse 7] 
Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory. Release Your power among us, Lord, That all may see Your glory.
