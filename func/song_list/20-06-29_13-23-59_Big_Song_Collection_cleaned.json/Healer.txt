[Verse 1] 
You hold my every moment You calm my raging sea You walk with me through fire You heal all my disease


[Verse 2] 
I trust in You I trust in You


[Verse 3] 
I believe You’re my healer I believe You are all I need I believe You’re my portion I believe You’re more than enough for me Jesus You’re all I need


[Verse 4] 
Nothing is impossible for You Nothing is impossible Nothing is impossible for You You hold my world in Your hands
