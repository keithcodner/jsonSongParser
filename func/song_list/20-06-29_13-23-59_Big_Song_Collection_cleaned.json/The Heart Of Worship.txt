[Verse 1] 
[E]When the music [B/D#]fades,|all is stripped [F#m]away,|and I simply [B]come;|| [E]Longing just to [B/D#]bring|something that's of [F#m]worth, that will bless Your [B]heart.


[Verse 2] 
[F#m]I'll bring You [E/G#]more than a [B]song, for a [B/D#]song in [F#m]itself, Is not what [E/G#]You have re[B]quired[B/D#] [F#m]You search much [E/G#]deeper with[B]in, through the way things ap[F#m]pear, You're looking [E/G#]into my [B]heart.


[Verse 3] 
[E]I'm coming back to the [B2/D#]heart of worship, And it's [F#m]all about You; it's [A]all about [B]You, Je[E]sus;|| [E]I'm sorry, Lord|for the [B2/D#]thing I've made it When it's [F#m]all about You; it's [A]all about [B]You, Je[E]sus.


[Verse 4] 
[E]King of endless [B/D#]worth,|no one could [F#m]express|how much You d[B]eserve;|| [E]Though I'm weak and [B/D#]poor,|all I have is [F#m]Yours, every single [B]breath.


[Verse 5] 
[F#m]I'll bring You [E/G#]more than a [B]song, for a [B/D#]song in [F#m]itself, Is not what [E/G#]You have re[B]quired[B/D#] [F#m]You search much [E/G#]deeper with[B]in, through the way things ap[F#m]pear, You're looking [E/G#]into my [B]heart.


[Verse 6] 
[E]I'm coming back to the [B2/D#]heart of worship, And it's [F#m]all about You; it's [A]all about [B]You, Je[E]sus;|| [E]I'm sorry, Lord|for the [B2/D#]thing I've made it When it's [F#m]all about You; it's [A]all about [B]You, Je[E]sus.


[Verse 7]
