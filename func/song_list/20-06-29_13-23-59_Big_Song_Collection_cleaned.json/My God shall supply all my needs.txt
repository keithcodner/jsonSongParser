[Verse 1] 
My God shall supply all my needs, My God shall supply all my needs, My God shall supply all my needs 'Cause it says so in the Bible, ||'Cause it says so (where?) In the book that came from heaven, 'Cause it says so (where?) Isaiah fifty-eight eleven. My God shall supply all my needs 'Cause it says so in the Bible.
