[Verse 1] 
You have called us chosen, A royal priesthood, A holy nation, We belong to You. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Take our lives as a sacrifice; Shine in us Your holy light. Purify our hearts' desire; Be to us a consuming fire.


[Verse 3] 
You have shown us mercy, You have redeemed us; Our hearts cry 'Father, We belong to You.' (Repeat) 


[Verse 4] 
Take our lives as a sacrifice; Shine in us Your holy light. Purify our hearts' desire; Be to us a consuming fire.
