[Verse 1] 
I will never be the same Now my eyes are open wide. I have been forever changed Through the power of His blood.


[Verse 2] 
I will triumph in the cross That my Saviour bore for me. I will stand with confidence Because of Jesus. I no longer fear the grave, I'm a child of His grace. I no longer feel ashamed, Because of Jesus.
