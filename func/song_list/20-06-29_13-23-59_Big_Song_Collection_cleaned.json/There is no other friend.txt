[Verse 1] 
There is no other friend, There is no other friend like You, O Lord; No other brother, no other sister like You. ||There is no other love, There is no other love like You, O Lord; No other sweeter, no other fountain but You.


[Verse 2] 
How long until I'm satisfied? I must have more of You. For I was born in Zion, Awakened love is crying out for You. Lord, it must be You!


[Verse 3] 
If I am healed by just one touch of Your garment, Lord, Then how much more of Your love is for me Than I'm tasting, Lord? Draw me, take me, I will run Over the mountains and down Into the valley, I will run with You.


[Verse 4] 
Ah, all my fountains are in You. Ah, all my fountains are in You.
