[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Redeemer, Friend and King to me. My refuge, my comfort, You're everything to me. And this heart is on fire for You, Yes, this heart is on fire for You.


[Verse 2] 
For You alone are wonderful, You alone are Counsellor, Everlasting Father, Mighty in the heavens. Never to forget the love You displayed upon a cross, Son of God, I thank You, Prince of Peace, I love Your name.


[Verse 3] 
Saviour, Healer, Just and true are You. Now reigning in glory, Most high and living God. And this heart is in awe of You, Yes, this heart is in awe of You.


[Verse 4] 
For You alone are wonderful, You alone are Counsellor, Everlasting Father, Mighty in the heavens. Never to forget the love You displayed upon a cross, Son of God, I thank You, Prince of Peace, I love Your name.
