[Verse 1] 
[Am]Many years ago I was [Dm]petrified, I was [G]stealing, lusting, blaspheming and [C]telling many lies I was [F]on my way to Hell all be[Dm]cause of my great sin, Then You [E]came into my life, I just had to let You in|| So come [Am]on, walk in my [Dm]door, when You [G]touched my heart oh Lord, all my [C]tears began to flow No more [F]hopeless days and nights of my [Dm]being all alone, [E]Now You're in my life and I'm a part of Your great home


[Verse 2] 
[Am]And I'm free to stay with [Dm]You, Light has [G]come into my life, our re[C]lationship brand new You [F]said You'd never leave me, and You'd [Dm]never let me go That's [E]why my eyes are on You, that's why You are my Lord.|| So let [Am]me, stay on my [Dm]knees, always [G]keep me close to You, hold me [C]Jesus, will You please? Your [F]precious life You gave, and [Dm]by Your blood You save I'm re[E]deemed, and from prison I'm set free!


[Verse 3] 
Oh [Am]I, I am a[Dm]live, once [G]dead in my great sin, now I'm [C]happy by Your side For[F]ever I will live, one [Dm]day will do no wrong I'll [E]be with You forever, and in my heart there is a song|| Oh [Am]I, I am a[Dm]live, once [G]dead in my great sin, now I'm [C]happy by Your side For[F]ever I will live, one [Dm]day will do no wrong I am a[E]live, I am alive! Hey, hey!
