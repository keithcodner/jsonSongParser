[Verse 1] 
I'm standing here to testify, (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All) To sing of how He changed my heart. (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All) ||I was bound by hate and pride, (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All) Never knowing of His light. (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All)


[Verse 2] 
I did not think I could have peace, (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All) Trapped inside by fear and shame. (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All) ||He wiped away all of my grief, (Leader) O, the Lord is good. (All) When I believed upon His name. (Leader)


[Verse 3] 
Come to the light, come as you are; You can be the friend of God. Humble yourself, give Him your heart, He will meet you where you are. (Last chorus)


[Verse 4] 
Come to the light, just as you are; Fall on the Rock for the wasted years. He will restore all that was lost, Surrender now, His power is here. Clap Your hands, O God. Clap Your hands, O God. (Repeat)
