[Verse 1] 
There's a river of joy that flows from Your throne, O river of joy flow through me. There's a river of joy that flows from Your throne: Come, Holy Spirit, with joy, Come, Holy Spirit, with joy.


[Verse 2] 
I will rise up on the wings of an eagle; With joy I receive Your love. I will praise You with a song everlasting. Thank You, Lord, for Your love. Thank You, Lord, for Your love.
