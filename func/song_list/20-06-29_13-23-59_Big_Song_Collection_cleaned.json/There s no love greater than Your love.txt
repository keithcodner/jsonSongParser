[Verse 1] 
There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You. There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You.


[Verse 2] 
I want to hear it sung around the world That Jesus, You are Lord of all. And our praises ring that You are King Of all the heavens and the earth. And at Your name we bow, You've turned our mourning into dancing.


[Verse 3] 
There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You. There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You.


[Verse 4] 
Want to see the day when all will know That Jesus, You are Lord of all. And we'll hear the songs of freedom sound Upon the lips of young and old. And every knee shall bow, Let all the earth rejoice with gladness.


[Verse 5] 
There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You. There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You.


[Verse 6] 
You came with love brighter than the day. Who can deny the wonder of Your name? Don't let me fall, I was born to be with You: There's no love like You.


[Verse 7] 
There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You. There's no love greater than Your love, There's no love greater than You.
