[Verse 1] 
You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, my Lord. You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, my Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Every day my disobedience Grieves Your loving heart; But then redeeming love breaks through, And causes me to worship You.


[Verse 3] 
(Men - Women echo) Redeemer, Saviour, Healer And Friend. Every day Renew my ways, Fill me with love That never ends. 


[Verse 4] 
You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, my Lord. You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, You are merciful to me, my Lord.
