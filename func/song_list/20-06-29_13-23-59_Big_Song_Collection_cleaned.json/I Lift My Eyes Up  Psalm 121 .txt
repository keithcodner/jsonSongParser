[Verse 1] 
[Bb]I lift my [Eb]eyes up, [Bb]up to the [Eb]mountains, [Bb]Where does my [Eb]help [Bb]come [F]from? [Bb]My help comes [Eb]from You, [Bb]Maker of [Eb]heaven, [Bb]Creator [Eb]of [Bb]the [F]earth.


[Verse 2] 
[Bb]O how I [Eb]need You, [Bb]Lord, You are my [Eb]only [Bb]hope, You're my [Eb]on[Bb]ly [F]prayer; [Bb]So I will [Eb]wait for [Bb]You To come and [Eb]rescue [Bb]me, Come and [Eb]give [Bb]me [F]life.


[Verse 3] 
[Bb]You keep my [Eb]feet firm, [Bb]You will not [Eb]slumber, [Bb]Oh Lord You [Eb]keep [Bb]me [F]whole. [Bb]You're at my [Eb]right hand, [Bb]a Shade be[Eb]side me, [Bb]Preserver [Eb]of [Bb]my [F]soul.


[Verse 4] 
[Bb]O how I [Eb]need You, [Bb]Lord, You are my [Eb]only [Bb]hope, You're my [Eb]on[Bb]ly [F]prayer; [Bb]So I will [Eb]wait for [Bb]You To come and [Eb]rescue [Bb]me, Come and [Eb]give [Bb]me [F]life.
