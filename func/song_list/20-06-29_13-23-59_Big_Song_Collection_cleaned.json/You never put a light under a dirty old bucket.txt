[Verse 1] 
You never put a light under a dirty old bucket. You never put a light under a dirty old bucket. You never put a light under a dirty old bucket If you want light to shine around, round, round.


[Verse 2] 
Shine, shine around, round round. Shine, shine around, round, round. Shine a light that everyone can see. Lord, help me let my little light shine, Not just Sundays, all the time, So friends give praise to You When they see me.
