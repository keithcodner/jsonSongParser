[Verse 1] 
As the deer pants for the water, So my soul, it thirsts for You, For You, O God, For You, O God. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
When can I come before You And see Your face? My heart and my flesh cry out For the living God, For the living God.


[Verse 3] 
Deep calls to deep At the thunder of Your waterfalls. Your heart of love is calling out to me. By this I know that I am Yours And You are mine. ||Your waves of love are breaking over me. Your waves of love are breaking over me. Your waves of love are breaking over me.
