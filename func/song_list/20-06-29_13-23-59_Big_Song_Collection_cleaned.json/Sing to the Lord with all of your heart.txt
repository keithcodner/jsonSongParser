[Verse 1] 
Sing to the Lord with all of your heart; Sing of the glory that's due to His name. Sing to the Lord with all of your soul, Join all of heaven and earth to proclaim:


[Verse 2] 
You are the Lord, the Saviour of all, God of creation, we praise You. We sing the songs that awaken thedawn, God of creation, we praise You.


[Verse 3] 
Sing to the Lord with all of your mind, With understanding give thanks to the King. Sing to the Lord with all of your strength, Living our lives as a praise offering. 


[Verse 4] 
You are the Lord, the Saviour of all, God of creation, we praise You. We sing the songs that awaken thedawn, God of creation, we praise You.
