[Verse 1] 
Prayer is like a telephone For us to talk to Jesus. Prayer is like a telephone For us to talk to God. Prayer is like a telephone For us to talk to Jesus. Pick it up and use it every day.


[Verse 2] 
We can shout out loud, We can whisper softly, We can make no noise at all. But He'll always hear our call.
