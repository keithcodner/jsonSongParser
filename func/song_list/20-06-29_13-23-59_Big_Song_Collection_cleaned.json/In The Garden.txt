[Verse 1] 
I [G]come to the garden alone, While the [C]dew is still on the [G]roses; And the [D]voice I hear falling [G]on my ear, The [A7]Son of God dis[D]closes.


[Verse 2] 
And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me, And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own; And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there, None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.


[Verse 3] 
He [G]speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so [C]sweet the birds hush their [G]singing; And the [D]melody that He [G]gave to me, With[A7]in my heart is [D]ringing.


[Verse 4] 
And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me, And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own; And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there, None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.


[Verse 5] 
I'd [G]stay in the garden with Him, Though the [C]night around me be [G]falling; But He [D]bids me go; thru the [G]voice of woe, His [A7]voice to me is [D]calling.


[Verse 6] 
And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me, And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own; And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there, None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.
