New covenant people rejoice, Lift up your eyes and see your King. Reigning in power on His heavenly throne, Angels are joyfully singing:

To the Father, our Creator, To our Judge and Lord. And to Jesus, Mediator, Who has cleansed us in His blood.


[Verse 3] 
Let us through Jesus draw near to God, Offering up our sacrifice, Confessing that Jesus is Lord over all, Joining with heavenly praises:


[Verse 4] 
To the Father, our Creator, To our Judge and Lord. And to Jesus, Mediator, Who has cleansed us in His blood.


[Verse 5] 
We give thanks to You with fear, Holy God, consuming fire, Confessing that Jesus is Lord over all, We bring our love and devotion: 


[Verse 6] 
To the Father, our Creator, To our Judge and Lord. And to Jesus, Mediator, Who has cleansed us in His blood.
