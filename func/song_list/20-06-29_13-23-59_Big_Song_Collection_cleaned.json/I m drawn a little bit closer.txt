[Verse 1] 
I'm drawn a little bit closer to You, Hearing You whisper to me; A little bit nearer to You, Hearing the beat of Your heart. Sensing Your power at work, Seeing the need in Your world: A little bit closer to You.


[Verse 2] 
As I see Your faithfulness, As I fix my eyes on You, O Lord; As I run the race You've run, Every day, every day.
