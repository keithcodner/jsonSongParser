[Verse 1] 
Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness, Opened my eyes, let me see Beauty that made This heart adore You, Hope of a life spent with You.


[Verse 2] 
So here I am to worship, Here I am to bow down, Here I am to say that You're my God; And You're altogether lovely, Altogether worthy, Altogether wonderful to me.


[Verse 3] 
King of all days, Oh so highly exalted, Glorious in heaven above; Humbly You came To the earth You created, All for love's sake became poor.


[Verse 4] 
So here I am to worship, Here I am to bow down, Here I am to say that You're my God; And You're altogether lovely, Altogether worthy, Altogether wonderful to me.


[Verse 5] 
And I'll never know How much it cost To see my sin upon that cross. And I'll never know How much it cost To see my sin upon that cross.


[Verse 6] 
So here I am to worship, Here I am to bow down, Here I am to say that You're my God; And You're altogether lovely, Altogether worthy, Altogether wonderful to me.
