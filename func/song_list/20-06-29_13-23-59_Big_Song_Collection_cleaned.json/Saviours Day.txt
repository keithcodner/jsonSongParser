[Verse 1] 
Now we have been through the harvest Winter has truly begun Now we have walked in the chill of the night We are waiting for, waiting for For the saviour's day Many have come from the valleys Many have come from the hills Many have started their journey home To be with someone with someone On the saviour's day Open your eyes on saviour's day Don't look back or turn away Life can be yours if you'll only stay He is calling you, calling you On the saviours day Here's to the god of the present Here's to the god of the past Here's to the hope in the future he brings We will sing to him, sing to him On the savior's day Joining the old and the young ones Joining the black and the white Meeting the need of the hungry is he We will ever remember him On the saviour's day Open your eyes on saviour's day Don't look back or turn away Life can be yours if you'll only stay He is calling you, calling you On the saviours day
