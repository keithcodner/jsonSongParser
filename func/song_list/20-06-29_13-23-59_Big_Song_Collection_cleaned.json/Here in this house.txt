[Verse 1] 
We've gathered here, In faith we believe, We lift our voices, His praises we sing, What ever we need Our God will provide, The Father is waiting With arms open wide...


[Verse 2] 
Here in this house There is a blessing, Here in this house He's given us hope! Here in this house Refreshing anointing, || Filling our hearts with perfect love, There's mercy and grace, Falling like rain, Here in this house.


[Verse 3] 
Here in His presence There is fullness of joy Peace like a river Flooding our souls. We see His glory Surrounding this place There's healing, forgiveness, Mercy and grace...


[Verse 4] 
Here in this house There is a blessing, Here in this house He's given us hope! Here in this house Refreshing anointing, || Filling our hearts with perfect love, There's mercy and grace, Falling like rain, Here in this house.
