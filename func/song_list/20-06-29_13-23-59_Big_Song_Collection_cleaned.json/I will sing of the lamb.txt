[Verse 1] 
I will sing of the lamb, Of the price that was paid for me, Purchased by God, Giving all He could give! Here now I stand In the garments of righteousness; Death has no hold, for in Jesus I live.


[Verse 2] 
I will sing of His blood That flows for my wretchedness, Wounds that are bared, That I may be healed; Power and compassion, The marks of His ministry: May they be mine as I harvest His field.


[Verse 3] 
I will sing of the lamb, Of the price that was paid for me, Purchased by God, Giving all He could give! Here now I stand In the garments of righteousness; Death has no hold, for in Jesus I live.


[Verse 4] 
Once I was blind, Yet believed I saw everything, Proud in my ways, Yet a fool in my part; Lost and alone In the company of multitudes, Life in my body, yet death in my heart.


[Verse 5] 
I will sing of His blood That flows for my wretchedness, Wounds that are bared, That I may be healed; Power and compassion, The marks of His ministry: May they be mine as I harvest His field.


[Verse 6] 
What shall I give To the Man who gave everything, Humbling Himself Before all He had made? Dare I withold My own life from His sovereignty? I shall give all for the sake of His name!


[Verse 7] 
Once I was blind, Yet believed I saw everything, Proud in my ways, Yet a fool in my part; Lost and alone In the company of multitudes, Life in my body, yet death in my heart.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb. Oh, I will sing of the Lamb. My heart fills with wonder, My mouth fills with praise! Hallelujah, hallelujah.


[Verse 9] 
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb. Oh, I will sing of the Lamb. Oh, why should the King Save a sinner like me? Hallelujah, hallelujah.


[Verse 10] 
Oh, I will sing of the Lamb. Oh, I will sing of the Lamb. I'll sing of His love For the rest of my days! Hallelujah, hallelujah.
