[Verse 1] 
Is it true today|That when people pray Cloudless skies will break Kings and queens will shake?


[Verse 2] 
Yes it's true|And I believe it I'm living for You


[Verse 3] 
Well it's true today|That when people pray We'll see dead men rise And the blind set free?


[Verse 4] 
Well it's true today|That when people pray We'll see dead men rise And the blind set free?


[Verse 5] 
I'm gonna be|A history maker in this land. I'm gonna be|A speaker of truth to all mankind|| I'm gonna stand I'm gonna run into Your arms Into Your arms again


[Verse 6] 
Well it's true today|That when people stand With the fire of God|And the truth in hand|| We'll see miracles|We'll see angels sing We'll see broken hearts|Making history?


[Verse 7] 
Well it's true today|That when people pray We'll see dead men rise And the blind set free?


[Verse 8] 
I'm gonna be|A history maker in this land. I'm gonna be|A speaker of truth to all mankind|| I'm gonna stand I'm gonna run into Your arms Into Your arms again


[Verse 9] 
Into Your arms|Into Your arms again

Into Your arms|Into Your arms again


[Verse 13] 
Yes it's true|And I believe it I'm living for You I'm living for You
