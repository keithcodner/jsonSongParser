[Verse 1] 
In every day that dawns, I see the light of Your splendour around me; And everywhere I turn, I know the gift of Your favour upon me. What can I do but give You glory, Lord? Everything good has come from You.


[Verse 2] 
I'm grateful for the air I breathe, I'm so thankful for this life I live, For the mercies that You pour on me, And the blessings that meet every need. ||And the grace that is changing me From a hopeless case to a child that's free, Free to give You praise, For in everything I know You love me. I know You love me.


[Verse 3] 
Through all that I have known, I have been held in the shelter of Your hand; And as my life unfolds, You are revealing the wisdom Of Your sovereign plan. There are no shadows in Your faithfulness, There are no limits to Your love.


[Verse 4] 
I'm grateful for the air I breathe, I'm so thankful for this life I live, For the mercies that You pour on me, And the blessings that meet every need. ||And the grace that is changing me From a hopeless case to a child that's free, Free to give You praise, For in everything I know You love me. I know You love me.
