[Verse 1] 
We know that all things work together for our good For good to those who love the Lord; For God has called us to be just like His Son, To live and walk according to His word.


[Verse 2] 
We are more than conquerors, We are more than conquerors, Through Christ, through Christ.


[Verse 3] 
I am persuaded that neither death nor life, Nor angels, principalities, nor powers, Nor things that are now, nor things that are to come, Can separate us from the love of Christ.


[Verse 4] 
We are more than conquerors, We are more than conquerors, Through Christ, through Christ.


[Verse 5] 
If God is for us, who against us can prevail? No one can bring a charge against His chosen ones; And there will be no separation from our Lord, He has justified us through His precious blood. 


[Verse 6] 
We are more than conquerors, We are more than conquerors, Through Christ, through Christ.
