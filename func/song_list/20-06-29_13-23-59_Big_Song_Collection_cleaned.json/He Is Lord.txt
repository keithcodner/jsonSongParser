[Verse 1] 
[E]Emptied of His [B]glory, [A]God became a [E]man|To [A]walk on earth in [B]ridicule and [E]shame; A [A]Ruler yet a [B]Servant, a [C#m]Shepherd yet a [F#]Lamb,|A [E]Man of sorrows, [B]agony, and [E]pain.


[Verse 2] 
[E]Humbled and re[B]jected, [A]beaten and de[E]spised,|U[A]pon the cross the [B]Son of God was [E]slain; Just [A]like a lamb to [B]slaughter: a [C#m]sinless Sacri[F#]fice,|But [E]by His death His [B]loss became our [E]gain.


[Verse 3] 
[E]He is [F#m]Lord, [B]He is [E]Lord!|He has [E]risen [E/D#]from the [C#m]dead and He is [F#m]Lord![B] Every [E]knee shall [E7]bow, every [A]tongue con[Am]fess|that [E]Jesus [B]Christ is [E]Lord!


[Verse 4] 
[E]Satan's forces [B]crumbled [A]like a mighty [E]wall,|The [A]stone that held Him [B]in was rolled a[E]side; The [A]Prince of Life in [B]glory was [C#m]lifted over [F#]all,|Now [E]earth and heaven [B]echo with the [E]cry!


[Verse 5] 
[E]He is [F#m]Lord, [B]He is [E]Lord!|He has [E]risen [E/D#]from the [C#m]dead and He is [F#m]Lord![B] Every [E]knee shall [E7]bow, every [A]tongue con[Am]fess|that [E]Jesus [B]Christ is [E]Lord!


[Verse 6] 
[E]Humbled and re[B]jected, [A]beaten and de[E]spised,|U[A]pon the cross the [B]Son of God was [E]slain; Just [A]like a lamb to [B]slaughter: a [C#m]sinless Sacri[F#]fice,|But [E]by His death His [B]loss became our [E]gain.


[Verse 7] 
[E]You are [F#m]Lord, [B]You are [E]Lord!|You have [E]risen [E/D#]from the [C#m]dead and You are [F#m]Lord![B] And my [E]knee shall [E7]bow, and my [A]tongue con[Am]fess|that [E]Jesus [B]Christ is [E]Lord!
