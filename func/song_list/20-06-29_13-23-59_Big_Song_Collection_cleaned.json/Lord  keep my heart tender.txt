[Verse 1] 
Lord, keep my heart tender, Reaching with outstretched hands To Jesus Christ; Feeling my hardness melt, Knowing how Jesus felt, Possessed by love, Warm Calvary love.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, keep my heart tender, Reaching with outstretched hands For healing grace; Believe the word revealed - 'By His stripes we are healed' - Possessed by love, Whole Calvary love.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, keep my heart tender, Reaching with outstretched hands To those in need; Finding, as tears I weep, Compassion's well is deep, Possessed by love, Fresh Calvary love.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, keep my heart tender, Reaching with outstretched hands To God most high; Worshipping with desire, My heart consumed by fire, Possessed by love, Strong Calvary love.
