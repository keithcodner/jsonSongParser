[Verse 1] 
I see the Lord Seated on the throne, exalted: And the train of His robe Fills the temple with glory: The whole earth is filled, The whole earth is filled, The whole earth is filled With Your glory.


[Verse 2] 
Holy, holy, Holy, holy, Yes, holy is the Lord. Holy, holy, Holy, holy, Yes, holy is the Lord of Lords.
