[Verse 1] 
I am amazed By the power of Your grace, I am amazed That You took my sin and shame; Restoring hope, restoring dignity: Your grace covers me, Your grace covers me, oh.


[Verse 2] 
Saving grace, washing over me; Saving grace, that made a way for me: I was lost until You rescued me, Your grace covers me.


[Verse 3] 
I'm overwhelmed By Your love and goodness, I'm overwhelmed That You took my brokenness: Amazing love, how can this be? Your grace covers me, Your grace covers me. 


[Verse 4] 
Saving grace, washing over me; Saving grace, that made a way for me: I was lost until You rescued me, Your grace covers me.
