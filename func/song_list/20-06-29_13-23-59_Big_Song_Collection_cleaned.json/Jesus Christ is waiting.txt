[Verse 1] 
Jesus Christ is waiting, Waiting in the streets; No one is His neighbour, All alone He eats. Listen, Lord Jesus, I am lonely too: Make me, friend or stranger, Fit to wait on You.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus Christ is raging, Raging in the streets, Where injustice spirals And real hope retreats. Listen, Lord Jesus, I am angry too: In the kingdom's causes, Let me rage with You.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus Christ is healing, Healing in the streets, Curing those who suffer, Touching those He greets. Listen, Lord Jesus, I have pity too: Let my care be active, Healing just like You.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus Christ is dancing, Dancing in the streets, Where each sign of hatred He, With love, defeats. Listen, Lord Jesus, I should triumph too: Where good conquers evil, Let me dance with You.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus Christ is calling, Calling in the streets: 'Who will join My journey? I will guide their feet.' Listen, Lord Jesus, Let my fears be few: Walk one step before me; I will follow You.
