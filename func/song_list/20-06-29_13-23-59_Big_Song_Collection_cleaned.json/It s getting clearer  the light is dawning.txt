[Verse 1] 
It's getting clearer, the light is dawning, I'm pressing on to a higher place. The past behind me, I'm moving forward, And I will follow after You.


[Verse 2] 
You are my strength, You are my shield, You are the Rock on which I want to build my life, O Lord, O Lord. I won't compromise, I won't be denied, I want to keep my eyes on the prize Of knowing You, knowing You.


[Verse 3] 
There is a passion that burns within me, I long to see Your kingdom come. To know Your presence, to seek no other; I hunger, Lord, for more of You. 


[Verse 4] 
You are my strength, You are my shield, You are the Rock on which I want to build my life, O Lord, O Lord. I won't compromise, I won't be denied, I want to keep my eyes on the prize Of knowing You, knowing You.
