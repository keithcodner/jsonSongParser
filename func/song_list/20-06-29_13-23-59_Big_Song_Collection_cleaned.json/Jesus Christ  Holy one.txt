[Verse 1] 
Jesus Christ, Holy one, The lifter of our heads, Through You I come, conquering Son, To my Father in heaven. And I'm confident that I belong to You, As the Spirit testifies. I shall not fear, fear has no hold, So I cry 'Abba Father!'


[Verse 2] 
What mercies You have poured on me, With thankfulness I'll sing; I choose to fix my mind On all the blessings You have given me. ||For You've revealed to me Your grace, The wonder of the cross; You've breathed new life to me, And in Your victory I now stand today.
