[Verse 1] 
Jesus! the name high over all, In hell, or earth, or sky; Angels and men before it fall, And devils fear and fly, And devils fear and fly.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus! the name to sinners dear, The name to sinners given; It scatters all their guilty fear, It turns their hell to heaven, It turns their hell to heaven.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus! the prisoners' fetters breaks, And bruises Satan's head; Power into strengthless souls it speaks, And life into the dead, And life into the dead.


[Verse 4] 
O that the world might taste and see The riches of His grace! The arms of love that compass me Would all mankind embrace, Would all mankind embrace.


[Verse 5] 
His only righteousness I show, His saving grace proclaim; 'Tis all my business here below To cry: 'Behold the Lamb!' To cry: 'Behold the Lamb!'


[Verse 6] 
Happy if with my latest breath I might but gasp His name; Preach Him to all, and cry in death: 'Behold, behold the Lamb!' 'Behold, behold the Lamb!'
