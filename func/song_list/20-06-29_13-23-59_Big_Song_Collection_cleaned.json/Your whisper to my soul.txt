[Verse 1] 
Your whisper to my soul When I was like a child, Lifted off the yoke, Planted fields of hope In this heart of mine. ||You took me as I am, You knew what I had done, Still You took my shame, And You called my name, I was overcome.


[Verse 2] 
When You broke the bonds Of how I used to be, You rolled away the stone, You set the captive free.


[Verse 3] 
I wanna thank You, You're the God of mercy; I wanna thank You, Lord, For giving me peace. I wanna thank You, You're the God who loved me; I wanna thank You, You're the God who rescued me.


[Verse 4] 
You covered all my sin, Restored to me my youth again. And I am satisfied, For You have healed me And redeemed me, Crowned my head with endless beauty, Endless beauty.


[Verse 5] 
I wanna thank You, You're the God of mercy; I wanna thank You, Lord, For giving me peace. I wanna thank You, You're the God who loved me; I wanna thank You, You're the God who rescued me.
