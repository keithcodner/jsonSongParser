[Verse 1] 
O breath of life, Come sweeping through us, Revive Thy church With life and power. O Breath of Life, Come, cleanse, renew us, And fit Thy church To meet this hour.


[Verse 2] 
O Wind of God, Come, bend us, break us, Till humbly We confess our need; Then in Thy Tenderness remake us, Revive, restore; For this we plead.


[Verse 3] 
O Breath of Love, Come, breathe within us, Renewing thought And will and heart: Come, love of Christ, Afresh to win us, Revive Thy church In every part.


[Verse 4] 
Revive us, Lord! Is zeal abating While harvest fields Are vast and white? Revive us, Lord, The world is waiting, Equip Thy church To spread the light.
