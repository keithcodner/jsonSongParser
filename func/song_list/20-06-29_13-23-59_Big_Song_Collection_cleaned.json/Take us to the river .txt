[Verse 1] 
Take us to the river, Take us there in unity to sing A song of Your salvation To win this generation for our King. ||A song of Your forgiveness, For it is with grace that river flows; Take us to the river In the city of our God.


[Verse 2] 
Take us to Your throne room, Give us ears to hear the cry of heaven; For that cry is mercy, Mercy to the fallen sons of man: ||For mercy it has triumphed, Triumphed over judgement by Your blood; Take us to the throne room In the city of our God.


[Verse 3] 
For the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us: This is the year of the Lord. The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us, This is the year of the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Take us to the mountain, Lift us in the shadow of Your hands; Is this Your mighty angel, Who stands astride the ocean and the land? ||For in his hand Your mercy Showers on a dry and barren place; Take us to the mountain In the city of our God.


[Verse 5] 
For the Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us: This is the year of the Lord. The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us, This is the year of the Lord.
