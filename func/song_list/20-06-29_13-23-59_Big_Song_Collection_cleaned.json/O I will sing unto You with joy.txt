[Verse 1] 
O I will sing unto You with joy, O Lord, For You're the rock of my salvation, Come before You with thanksgiving And extol You with a song. ||For You're the greatest King above all else, You hold the depths of the earth in Your hand. O I will sing unto You with joy, O Lord, For You're the rock of my salvation.
