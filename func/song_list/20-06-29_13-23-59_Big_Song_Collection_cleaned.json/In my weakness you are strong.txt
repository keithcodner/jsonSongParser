[Verse 1] 
In my weakness you are strong, When I fall short You carry me along. Into my darkness You shine Your light, When I feel blinded, You restore my sight.


[Verse 2] 
You are the Lord, You never change, You still the storm when I call Your name. You're all I want, You're always there, No matter when, no matter where. You're the Lord, You never change. You're the Lord, You never change.


[Verse 3] 
I'm inconsistent, but You are true; I don't trust myself, but I depend on You. Look through my selfishness, and see my heart; Bring out the precious from the worthless parts.


[Verse 4] 
You are the Lord, You never change, You still the storm when I call Your name. You're all I want, You're always there, No matter when, no matter where. You're the Lord, You never change. You're the Lord, You never change.


[Verse 5] 
I need courage, Lord, to make a change; It's time my independence got rearranged. I'm tired of chasing after my own ways; So I'll serve You, Lord, Serve You, Lord, serve You, Lord, For the rest, rest of my days. 


[Verse 6] 
You are the Lord, You never change, You still the storm when I call Your name. You're all I want, You're always there, No matter when, no matter where. You're the Lord, You never change. You're the Lord, You never change.
