[Verse 1] 
You're the [Bb]Lion of Judah, the [Eb]Lamb Who was [Bb]slain, You ascended to heaven and [Eb]evermore shall [F]reign; At the [Bb]end of the age when the [Eb]earth You re[Bb]claim, You will gather the nations be[F]fore You.|| And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb Who was [Eb]cruci[F]fied, For with wisdom and mercy and justice He reigns at the [Eb]Father's [F]side.


[Verse 2] 
And the [Bb]angels will cry, "[Eb]Hail [Bb]the [F]Lamb Who was [Bb]slain for the world; [Eb]rule [Bb]in [F]power!" And the [Bb]earth shall reply, "[Eb]You [Bb]shall [F]reign As the [Bb]King of all kings and the [Eb]Lord of [F]all [Bb]lords!"


[Verse 3] 
There's a [Bb]shield in our hand and a [Eb]sword at our [Bb]side, There's a fire in our spirit that [Eb]cannot be de[F]nied; As the [Bb]Father has told us for [Eb]these you have [Bb]died, For the nations will gather be[F]fore you.|| And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb Who was [Eb]cruci[F]fied, Who went down to the grave yet was raised up to reign at the [Eb]Father's [F]side.


[Verse 4] 
And the [Bb]angels will cry, "[Eb]Hail [Bb]the [F]Lamb Who was [Bb]slain for the world; [Eb]rule [Bb]in [F]power!" And the [Bb]earth shall reply, "[Eb]You [Bb]shall [F]reign As the [Bb]King of all kings and the [Eb]Lord of [F]all [Bb]lords!"
