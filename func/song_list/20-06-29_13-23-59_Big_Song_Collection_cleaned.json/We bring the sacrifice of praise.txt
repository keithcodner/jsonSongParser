[Verse 1] 
We bring the sacrifice of praise Into the house of the Lord, We bring the sacrifice of praise Into the house of the Lord. We bring the sacrifice of praise Into the house of the Lord, We bring the sacrifice of praise Into the house of the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
And we offer up to You The sacrifices of thanksgiving, And we offer up to You The sacrifices of joy.
