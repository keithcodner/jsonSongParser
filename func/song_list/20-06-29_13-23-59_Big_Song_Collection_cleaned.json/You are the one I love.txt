[Verse 1] 
You are the one I love, You are the One that I adore. You are the one I love, You are the One that I adore.


[Verse 2] 
For You've called me by name, Drawn me close to Your heart, Washed away all my shame with Your tears. For the rest of my days, I will offer my life In thanksgiving and praise to my King.


[Verse 3] 
You are the one I love, You are the One that I adore. You are the one I love, You are the One that I adore.


[Verse 4] 
Now with You I will stay, For Your word is my light, And Your peace can allay all my fears; And my victory song Is the song of the cross, You have won me love so divine.


[Verse 5] 
You are the one I love, You are the One that I adore. You are the one I love, You are the One that I adore.


[Verse 6] 
Such precious, precious love.
