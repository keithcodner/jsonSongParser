[Verse 1] 
[G]Steadfast [Dsus4/F#]Stephen saw his [G/F]chance to open [C2]wide un[D]veiling [G]lies; [G]Delive[Dsus4/F#]ring his skin and [G/F]bones upon the [C2]hate-filled [D]battle [C2]cries; [C2]They [G]rushed him [C2]and they [G]stoned him, [C2]but his sights were [G]set on the [D]open [C2]skies.


[Verse 2] 
[C2]I'm in the [D]wake of [G]martyrs [D/F#]gone be[C2]fore me waiting to be [D]tried; [C2]Is the [D]strength and [G]trust I [D/F#]have in [C2]You enough that I would stand and [D]die? Stand and [G]die.


[Verse 3] 
[G]Caught in [Dsus4/F#]Cassie was a [G/F]candle burning [C2]from the [D]wick of [G]life; [G]She had [Dsus4/F#]found it when she [G/F]finally turned to [C2]You, that [D]graceful [C2]night; [C2]When they [G]asked her [C2]if she [G]knew You, [C2]what else could [G]she re[D]ply?


[Verse 4] 
[G]Now it's [Dsus4/F#]nearly twenty [G/F]hundred years since [C2]You were [D]cruci[G]fied; [G]With my [Dsus4/F#]heart and soul and [G/F]all You gave to [C2]me I would [D]give my [C2]life.
