[Verse 1] 
I bow down in humble adoration, Speak Your name with love and devotion, Jesus, the Lamb sacrificed for me. I see Your face, Your tender hands Scarred for me. ||I fall at Your feet with songs of praises singing; My joy is complete, You fulfil my longing. Prophet of God, my Priest and my King, I worship and adore.


[Verse 2] 
Before the Father's throne You ever intercede; You always hear my prayer, whatever I may plead. You wipe away my tears, You give me victory; By Your blood I am cleansed, I am free.
