[Verse 1] 
Lord, I will celebrate Your love, From deep within my heart, I celebrate Your love; I celebrate Your love given to me.


[Verse 2] 
You are the one that I adore; Lord, in Your presence is life forever more; The one that I adore. You are my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Healing me, releasing me, More and more reveal Yourself in me, My Lord, my Lord!
