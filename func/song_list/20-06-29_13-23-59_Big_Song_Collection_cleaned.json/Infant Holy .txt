[Verse 1] 
Infant Holy, Infant lowly, For His bed a cattle stall; Oxen lowing, little knowing, Christ the babe is Lord of all. Swift are winging angels singing, Nowells ringing, tidings bringing: Christ the babe is Lord of all; Christ the babe is Lord of all.


[Verse 2] 
Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping Vigil till the morning new; Saw the glory, heard the story, Tidings of a gospel true. Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, Praises voicing, greet the morrow: Christ the babe was born for you! Christ the babe was born for you!
