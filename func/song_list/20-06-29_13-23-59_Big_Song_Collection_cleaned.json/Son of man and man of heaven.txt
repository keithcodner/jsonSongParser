[Verse 1] 
Son of man and man of heaven, Full of grace and truth; Sinner's friend yet without sin, I want to be like You: Perfect in holiness, Full of faithfulness and love.


[Verse 2] 
Son of man and man of heaven, Full of grace and truth; Sinner's friend yet without sin, I want to be like You: Perfect in holiness, Full of faithfulness and love.


[Verse 3] 
You began a work in me, I know You'll see it through. There's a new song in my heart, And I want to sing to You. You lifted me from mire, From sin and from shame You set me free, And I know Your tenderness, I know Your power at work in me.


[Verse 4] 
You began a work in me, I know You'll see it through. There's a new song in my heart, And I want to sing to You. You lifted me from mire, From sin and from shame You set me free, And I know Your tenderness, I know Your power at work in me.


[Verse 5] 
I want to be like Jesus, I want to be like Jesus, I want to be like You, O Lord, our God. I want to be like Jesus, I want to be like Jesus, I want to be like You, O Lord, our God.


[Verse 6] 
You're making me like Jesus, You're making me like Jesus, You're making me like You, O Lord, our God. You're making me like Jesus, You're making me like Jesus, You're making me like You, O Lord, our God.
