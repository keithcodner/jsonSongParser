[Verse 1] 
My heart longs For Your love My soul thrusts For Your Touch


[Verse 2] 
There is no one else like You There is no one beside You There is no one else like You My God, my King No one else


[Verse 3] 
Nothing compares to You my God No one could ever take Your love away Youâ€™re my King, my everything Jesus
