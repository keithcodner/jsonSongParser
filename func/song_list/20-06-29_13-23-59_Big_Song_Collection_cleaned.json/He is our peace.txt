[Verse 1] 
He is our peace, Who has broken down every wall; He is our peace, He is our peace. He is our peace, Who has broken down every wall; He is our peace, He is our peace.


[Verse 2] 
Cast all your cares on Him, For He cares for you; He is our peace, He is our peace. Cast all your cares on Him, For He cares for you; He is our peace, He is our peace.
