[Verse 1] 
Jesus, lover of my soul, All consuming fire is in Your gaze. Jesus, I want You to know I will follow You all my days.


[Verse 2] 
For no one else In history is like You, And history itself belongs to You. Alpha and Omega, You have loved me, And I will share eternity with You.


[Verse 3] 
It's all about You, Jesus, And all this is for You, For Your glory and Your fame. It's not about me, As if You should do things my way; You alone are God, And I surrender to Your ways.
