[Verse 1] 
I will wave my hands In praise and adoration, I will wave my hands In praise and adoration, I will wave my hands In praise and adoration, Praise and adoration To the living God.


[Verse 2] 
For He's given me hands That just love clapping: One, two, one, two, three, And He's given me a voice That just loves shouting: 'Hallelujah!' || He's given me feet That just love dancing: One, two, one, two, three, And He's put me in a being That has no trouble seeing That whatever I am feeling He is worthy to be praised.
