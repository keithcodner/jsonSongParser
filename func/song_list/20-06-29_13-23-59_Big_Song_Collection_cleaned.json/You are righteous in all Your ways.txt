[Verse 1] 
You are righteous in all Your ways, You are good, You are good. You are truthful in all You say, You are good, You are good.


[Verse 2] 
And I bow my knee before You, In honour of Your name, For You alone are worthy, Worthy of my praise, Worthy of my praise.


[Verse 3] 
You are holy, faithful and true, You are good, You are good. You are gracious in all You do, You are good, You are good.
