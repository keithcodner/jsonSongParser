[Verse 1] 
I know You love to crown the humble, Pouring out grace for the broken heart. You bless the meek, You meet the lowly; Lord, as I bow, lift me to You.


[Verse 2] 
I keep on bowing down, bowing down, Keep on bowing down, What else can I do? Keep on bowing down, bowing down. What else can I do, To give it all to You?


[Verse 3] 
I'd like to be one such believer, Keeping my knees firmly on the ground. I'd like to tread humbly before You; Lord, as I bow, lift me to You.


[Verse 4] 
I keep on bowing down, bowing down, Keep on bowing down, What else can I do? Keep on bowing down, bowing down. What else can I do, To give it all to You?


[Verse 5] 
Do You smile when You see A humble believer on their knees? And my Lord, will You be pleased To look upon me, to look upon me? 


[Verse 6] 
I keep on bowing down, bowing down, Keep on bowing down, What else can I do? Keep on bowing down, bowing down. What else can I do, To give it all to You?
