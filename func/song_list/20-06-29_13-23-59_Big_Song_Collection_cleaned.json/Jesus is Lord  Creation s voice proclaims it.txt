[Verse 1] 
Jesus is Lord! Creation's voice proclaims it, For by His power Each tree and flower Was planned and made. Jesus is Lord! The universe declares it, Sun, moon and stars in heaven Cry, 'Jesus is Lord!'


[Verse 2] 
Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord! Praise Him with hallelujahs For Jesus is Lord!


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is Lord! Yet from His throne eternal In flesh He came to die in pain On Calvary's tree. Jesus is Lord! From Him all life proceeding, Yet gave His life a ransom Thus setting us free.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord! Praise Him with hallelujahs For Jesus is Lord!


[Verse 5] 
Jesus is Lord! O'er sin the mighty conqueror, From death He rose, and all His foes Shall own His name. Jesus is Lord! God sent His Holy Spirit To show by works of power That Jesus is Lord. 


[Verse 6] 
Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Lord! Praise Him with hallelujahs For Jesus is Lord!
