[Verse 1] 
To Him we come - Jesus Christ our Lord, God's own living Word, His dear Son: In Him there is no east and west, In Him all nations shall be blest; To all He offers peace and rest - Loving Lord!


[Verse 2] 
In Him we live - Christ our strength and stay, Life and Truth and Way, Friend divine: His power can break the chains of sin, Still all life's storms without, within, Help us the daily fight to win - Living Lord!


[Verse 3] 
For Him we go - Soldiers of the cross, Counting all things loss, Him to know; Going to every land and race, Preaching to all redeeming grace, Building His church in every place - Conquering Lord!


[Verse 4] 
With Him we serve - His the work we share With saints everywhere, Near and far; One in the task that faith requires, One in the zeal that never tires, One in the hope His love inspires - Coming Lord!


[Verse 5] 
Onward we go - Faithful, bold and true, Called His will to do Day by day Till, at the last, with joy we'll see Jesus in glorious majesty; Live with Him through eternity - Reigning Lord!
