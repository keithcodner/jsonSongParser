[Verse 1] 
Praises, For all that You've done I'll sing praises, For sending Your Son who would save me, Pouring out grace at the cross Where You died for me. ||Mercies, Through all of my life I've seen mercies, Through hardship and strife You are with me, By my side, You are good, So good to me. 


[Verse 2] 
Through Your death You brought me life, Took my shame, clothed me in white. 


[Verse 3] 
Lord, here I am, amazed again, That You would die to save a friend. You clear my sin and pay the cost, So on my knees I'll stay, At the foot of the cross.


[Verse 4] 
Worship, Day after day I will worship, For glory and grace, and for goodness, With all of my life I will be Your living praise. ||And Jesus, I'll always look unto Jesus, For guidance and strength and my focus, Trying to live how You want Your child to be.


[Verse 5] 
Lord, here I am, amazed again, That You would die to save a friend. You clear my sin and pay the cost, So on my knees I'll stay, At the foot of the cross.
