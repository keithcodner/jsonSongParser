[Verse 1] 
I come to You, to sit at Your feet, I hear You call, I'm longing to meet You. I lift my face to You, and catch Your eye, Oh how You satisfy.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Your love surrounds me. Jesus, Your love completes me.


[Verse 3] 
Now looking closer, I see the scars, Stories of love, You paid the greatest price, So that I may have life. Thank You, my Friend, You're showing me once again.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, Your love surrounds me. Jesus, Your love completes me.


[Verse 5] 
There's nothing like it, There's nothing like it, There's nothing like the love of God. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
Jesus, Your love surrounds me. Jesus, Your love completes me.


[Verse 7] 
No longer searching, I've found the One, Just touched the surface, only begun; This love goes deeper Than any I've known.


[Verse 8] 
Jesus, Your love surrounds me. Jesus, Your love completes me.
