[Verse 1] 
Healing grace, healing grace, Show me more of Your healing grace. Fill my life anew as I worship You, For Your healing grace to me.


[Verse 2] 
My eyes have been opened, And now I can see The love of the Father Given to me.


[Verse 3] 
Healing grace, healing grace, Show me more of Your healing grace. Fill my life anew as I worship You, For Your healing grace to me.


[Verse 4] 
My Saviour, Deliverer, The reason I sing, To You I surrender, For You are my King. 


[Verse 5] 
Healing grace, healing grace, Show me more of Your healing grace. Fill my life anew as I worship You, For Your healing grace to me.
