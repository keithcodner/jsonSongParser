[Verse 1] 
We give thanks to You, O Lord, Almighty God, The One who is, who was And is to come. You've taken up Your power And begun to reign, The nations bow before the Holy One.


[Verse 2] 
Now Your salvation, And Your power and Your kingdom Have all come, And You are Lord of all. The accuser of the brothers Has been hurled down forever, Overcome by the blood, Overcome by the blood, Overcome by the blood of the Lamb.
