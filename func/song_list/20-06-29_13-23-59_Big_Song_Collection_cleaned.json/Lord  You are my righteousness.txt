[Verse 1] 
Lord, You are my righteousness, The One who sanctifies my life, My Shepherd and my guide. Banner of deliverance, Warrior and my defence, In Your secret place I hide. ||Every other throne must fall And proclaim You Lord of all At the mention of Your name; My salvation and my light, In Your presence I abide And Your righteousness I claim.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
Though You are the King of kings, Yet You are my next of kin, And my nearest friend. Laying down Your life for me, Your amazing grace I see, And Your love without an end. ||How can I keep silent, Lord? Even stones obey Your word And they give to You their praise. You're the Lord of everything, All creation's voices sing Of the glory of Your name.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
