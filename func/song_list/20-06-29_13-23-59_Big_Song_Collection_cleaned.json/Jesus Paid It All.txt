[Verse 1] 
I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all."


[Verse 2] 
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone, Can change the leperâ€™s spots And melt the heart of stone.


[Verse 4] 
And when before the throne I stand in Him complete, "Jesus died my soul to save," My lips shall still repeat.


[Verse 5] 
Oh praise the One who paid my debt, And raised this life up from the dead.
