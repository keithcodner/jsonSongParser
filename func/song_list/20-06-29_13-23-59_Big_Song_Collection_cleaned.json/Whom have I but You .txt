[Verse 1] 
Whom have I but You? Whom have I but You?


[Verse 2] 
Though the mountains fall, They fall into the sea.


[Verse 3] 
Whom have I but You? Whom have I but You?


[Verse 4] 
Though the coloured dawn May turn to shades of grey.


[Verse 5] 
Whom have I but You? Whom have I but You?


[Verse 6] 
Though the questions asked May never be resolved. 


[Verse 7] 
Whom have I but You? Whom have I but You?
