[Verse 1] 
See amid the winter's snow, Born for us on earth below, See the tender Lamb appears, Promised from eternal years.


[Verse 2] 
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn! Hail, redemption's happy dawn! Sing through all Jerusalem, Christ is born in Bethlehem.


[Verse 3] 
Lo, within a manger lies He who built the starry skies; He, who throned in height sublime Sits amid the cherubim.


[Verse 4] 
Say, ye holy shepherds, say What your joyful news today; Wherefore have ye left your sheep On the lonely mountain steep?


[Verse 5] 
"As we watched at dead of night, Lo, we saw a wondrous light; Angels singing peace on earth Told us of the Saviour's birth".


[Verse 6] 
Sacred infant, all divine, What a tender love was Thine, Thus to come from highest bliss Down to such a world as this.


[Verse 7] 
Teach, O teach us , Holy Child, By Thy Face so meek and mild, Teach us to resemble Thee, In Thy Sweet humility!
