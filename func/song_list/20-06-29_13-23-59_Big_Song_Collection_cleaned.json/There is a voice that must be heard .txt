[Verse 1] 
There is a voice that must be heard, There is a song that must be sung; There is a name that must be lifted high. There is a treasure more than gold, There is a King upon the throne; There is One whose praise will fill the skies.


[Verse 2] 
His name is Jesus, Friend of sinners, Jesus, Jesus, Friend of mine.


[Verse 3] 
There is a peace that calms our fears, There is a love stronger than death; There is a hope that goes beyond the grave. There is a Friend who won't let go, There is a heart that beats for you; There is one name by which we are saved.


[Verse 4] 
His name is Jesus, Friend of sinners, Jesus, Jesus, Friend of mine.


[Verse 5] 
When I was captive to my fears, You were the One who came to me, You set me free.


[Verse 6] 
His name is Jesus, Friend of sinners, Jesus, Jesus, Friend of mine.
