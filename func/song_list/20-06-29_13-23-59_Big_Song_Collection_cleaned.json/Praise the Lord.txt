[Verse 1] 
Praise the Lord, All you servants of the Lord, Who minister by night within His house. Lift up your hands Within the sanctuary, And praise the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
May the Lord, The Maker of heaven and earth, May this Lord bless you from Zion; Lift up your hands Within the sanctuary And praise the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
We praise You, Lord, We praise You, Lord; Hallelujah, we praise You, Lord.
