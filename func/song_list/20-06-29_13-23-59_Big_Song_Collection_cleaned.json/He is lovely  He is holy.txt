[Verse 1] 
He is lovely, He is holy, Gave supremely, that all men may see. He is gentle, tender-hearted, Risen Saviour, He is God.


[Verse 2] 
Master, Maker, Life Creator, Come and dwell in me, That my heart may know Your tender mercy. Shine through me that all may see Your love so full and free; And I'll declare Your praise Through endless ages.
