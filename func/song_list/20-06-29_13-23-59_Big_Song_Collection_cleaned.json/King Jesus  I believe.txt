[Verse 1] 
King Jesus, I believe The words of life You breathe, Your spoken promises, A guiding light for our feet. We fall down to our knees And weep with those who weep: Let justice flow upon this earth, A never failing stream.


[Verse 2] 
I'm thirsty, longing just to see Your kingdom come, Praying that today Your love is shown. I'm hungry for the will of God to be made known, Praying for the day of Your return.


[Verse 3] 
You have anointed us To bind the broken heart: Proclaim deliverance For those enslaved in the dark. You pour the oil of joy All over my despair. O Spirit of the Sovereign Lord, Empower us once again.


[Verse 4] 
I'm thirsty, longing just to see Your kingdom come, Praying that today Your love is shown. I'm hungry for the will of God to be made known, Praying for the day of Your return.


[Verse 5] 
We pray, we pray, We pray for the kingdom. We pray, we pray. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
I'm thirsty, longing just to see Your kingdom come, Praying that today Your love is shown. I'm hungry for the will of God to be made known, Praying for the day of Your return.
