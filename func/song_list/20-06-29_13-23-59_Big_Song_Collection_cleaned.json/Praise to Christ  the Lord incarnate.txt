[Verse 1] 
Praise to Christ, the Lord incarnate, Gift of God by human birth: He it is who came among us, Shared our life and showed our worth; Ours the turmoil He encountered, Ours the fight He made His own; Now within our hearts His Spirit Makes His way of freedom known.


[Verse 2] 
Praise to Christ our Saviour and our King. Praise to Christ our King.


[Verse 3] 
Praise to Christ, the Man of Sorrows, Tasting death for our release: His the cup of bitter anguish, Ours the pardon, ours the peace; His the blood that seals forgiveness, Ours the weight of guilt He bore - So by death and resurrection Christ has opened heaven's door.


[Verse 4] 
Praise to Christ our Saviour and our King. Praise to Christ our King.


[Verse 5] 
Praise to Christ, the Priest eternal: Still for us He intercedes; Still He sees our pains and problems - How He understands our needs! Yesterday, today, forever, Always He remains the same: Pledged to bring us to the Father, Strong in grace and free from blame.


[Verse 6] 
Praise to Christ our Saviour and our King. Praise to Christ our King.
