[Verse 1] 
O righteous God who searches minds and hearts, Bring to an end the violence of my foes, And make the righteous more secure, O righteous God.


[Verse 2] 
Sing praise to the name of the Lord most high. Sing praise to the name of the Lord most high. Give thanks to the Lord who rescues me, O righteous God.


[Verse 3] 
O Lord my God, I take refuge in You; Save and deliver me from all my foes. My shield is God the Lord most high, O Lord my God. 


[Verse 4] 
Sing praise to the name of the Lord most high. Sing praise to the name of the Lord most high. Give thanks to the Lord who rescues me, O righteous God.
