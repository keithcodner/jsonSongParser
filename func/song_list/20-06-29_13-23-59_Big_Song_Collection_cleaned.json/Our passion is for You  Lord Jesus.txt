[Verse 1] 
Our passion is for You, Lord Jesus; Your grace has fuelled a fire That burns within our hearts. There's nowhere that compares With Your presence; We've tasted of Your Spirit, So there's just one thing we ask:


[Verse 2] 
More, more, more, more, more. More, more, more, more, more. Pour out, pour out, Pour out Your Spirit, O Lord. Pour out, pour out, Pour out Your Spirit, O Lord
