[Verse 1] 
Worship the Lord, See the splendour of His holiness. Give to the Lord all the glory due His name. Come and adore, Come and lay your hearts before Him. With thankfulness and love, Come and shout aloud your praise.


[Verse 2] 
Declare His glory among all the nations. Declare His majesty, His splendour and power. Proclaim salvation, His goodness and mercy; For great is the Lord and most worthy, Worthy of praise.


[Verse 3] 
We are His people, belonging to our Father, Set apart for truth, we are chosen by God. With confidence we come, We are free and we're forgiven. Blessed are the ones Who put their hope in God.


[Verse 4] 
Declare His glory among all the nations. Declare His majesty, His splendour and power. Proclaim salvation, His goodness and mercy; For great is the Lord and most worthy, Worthy of praise.


[Verse 5] 
Please come upon us now, We want to see Your face, Lord. Soften our hearts, take us deeper into You. Spirit, fill our minds With the knowledge of Your wisdom. Come and touch our mouths, Help us tell of all You've done.


[Verse 6] 
Declare His glory among all the nations. Declare His majesty, His splendour and power. Proclaim salvation, His goodness and mercy; For great is the Lord and most worthy, Worthy of praise.
