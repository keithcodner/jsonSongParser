[Verse 1] 
You've touched my heart With words of Your mercy And thoughts of Your beauty. Your presence, God, Has captured me now With the hope of Your glory. You've opened my eyes to see You're all that this heart can need.


[Verse 2] 
For what is worthy of the King of kings, But a heart that is satisfied in loving You? Yours is the song, Yours is the praise I'll bring, With a passion for the wonder Of seeing Your glory here.


[Verse 3] 
This song I'll bring Is my song of love from A heart that's been broken. It's what You've done, For I've been set free by The life that You've given. Faithful and holy One, Forever I live to sing.


[Verse 4] 
For what is worthy of the King of kings, But a heart that is satisfied in loving You? Yours is the song, Yours is the praise I'll bring, With a passion for the wonder Of seeing Your glory here.
