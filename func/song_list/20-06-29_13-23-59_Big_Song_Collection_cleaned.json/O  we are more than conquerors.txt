[Verse 1] 
O, we are more than conquerors. O, we are more than conquerors, And who can separate us from The love, the love of God? O yes, we are, We are more than conquerors. O, we are more than conquerors.


[Verse 2] 
For He has promised to fulfil His will in us, He said that He would guide us with His eye; For He has blessed us with all gifts in Christ, And we are His delight.


[Verse 3] 
O, we are more than conquerors. O, we are more than conquerors, And who can separate us from The love, the love of God? O yes, we are, We are more than conquerors. O, we are more than conquerors.


[Verse 4] 
For He's within to finish what's begun in me, He opens doors that no one can deny; He makes a way where there's no other way, And gives me wings to fly. 


[Verse 5] 
O, we are more than conquerors. O, we are more than conquerors, And who can separate us from The love, the love of God? O yes, we are, We are more than conquerors. O, we are more than conquerors.
