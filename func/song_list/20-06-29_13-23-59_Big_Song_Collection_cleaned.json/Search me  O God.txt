[Verse 1] 
Search me, O God, And know my heart; Know all my thoughts and my ways. Cleanse me, O God, Give me a pure heart, That I may see Your face.


[Verse 2] 
For You are an all consuming fire! For You are an all consuming fire!


[Verse 3] 
Teach me, O God, Show me Your ways, And I will walk in Your truth. Keep me, O God, Keep me from falling, That I may stand before You.


[Verse 4] 
For You are an all consuming fire! For You are an all consuming fire!


[Verse 5] 
Fill me, O God, And send me out, And I will make You known. Give me Your heart And Your compassion, And let Your mercy flow. 


[Verse 6] 
For You are an all consuming fire! For You are an all consuming fire!
