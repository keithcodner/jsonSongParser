[Verse 1] 
Over all the earth, You reign on high, Every mountain stream, Every sunset sky. But my one request, Lord, my only aim Is that You'd reign in me again.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, reign in me, Reign in Your power; Over all my dreams, In my darkest hour. You are the Lord of all I am, So won't You reign in me again?


[Verse 3] 
Over every thought, Over every word, May my life reflect The beauty of my Lord; 'Cause You mean more to me Than any earthly thing, So won't You reign in me again?


[Verse 4] 
Lord, reign in me, Reign in Your power; Over all my dreams, In my darkest hour. You are the Lord of all I am, So won't You reign in me again?
