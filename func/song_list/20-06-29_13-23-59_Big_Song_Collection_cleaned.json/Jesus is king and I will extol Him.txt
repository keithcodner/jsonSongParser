[Verse 1] 
Jesus is king and I will extol Him, Give Him the glory, and honour His name. He reigns on high, enthroned in theheavens, Word of the Father, exalted for us.


[Verse 2] 
We have a hope that is steadfast and certain, Gone through the curtain and touching the throne. We have a Priest who is there interceding, Pouring His grace on our lives day by day.


[Verse 3] 
We come to Him, our Priest and Apostle, Clothed in His glory and bearing His name, Laying our lives with gladness before Him; Filled with His Spirit we worship the King.


[Verse 4] 
O Holy One, our hearts do adore You; Thrilled with Your goodness we give You our praise. Angels in light with worship surround Him, Jesus, our Saviour, forever the same.
