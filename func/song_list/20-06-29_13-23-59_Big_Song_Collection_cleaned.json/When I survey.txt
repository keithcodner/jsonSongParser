[Verse 1] 
When I survey The wondrous cross On which the Prince Of Glory died, My richest gain I count but loss, And pour contempt On all my pride.


[Verse 2] 
See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love Flow mingled down; Did e'er such love And sorrow meet Or thorns compose So rich a crown?


[Verse 3] 
Oh, the wonderful cross, Oh, the wonderful cross Bids me come and die and find That I may truly live. Oh, the wonderful cross, Oh, the wonderful cross, All who gather here by grace Draw near and bless Your name.


[Verse 4] 
Were the whole realm Of nature mine, That were an offering Far too small. Love so amazing, So divine Demands my soul, My life, my all.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, the wonderful cross, Oh, the wonderful cross Bids me come and die and find That I may truly live. Oh, the wonderful cross, Oh, the wonderful cross, All who gather here by grace Draw near and bless Your name.
