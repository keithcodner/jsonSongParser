[Verse 1] 
I just want to be where You are, Dwelling daily in Your presence. I don't want to worship from afar, Draw me near to where You are. I just want to be where You are, In Your dwelling place forever. Take me to the place where You are, I just want to be with You.


[Verse 2] 
I want to be where You are, Dwelling in You presence, Feasting at Your table, Surrounded by Your glory. In Your presence, That's where I always want to be, I just want to be, I just want to be with You.


[Verse 3] 
O my God, You are my strength and my song, And when I'm in Your presence, Though I'm weak, You're always strong. 


[Verse 4] 
I want to be where You are, Dwelling in You presence, Feasting at Your table, Surrounded by Your glory. In Your presence, That's where I always want to be, I just want to be, I just want to be with You.
