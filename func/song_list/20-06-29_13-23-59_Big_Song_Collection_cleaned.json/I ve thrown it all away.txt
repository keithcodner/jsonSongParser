[Verse 1] 
I've thrown it all away That I might gain a life in You. I've found all else is loss Compared to the joys of knowing You. Your beauty and Your majesty Are far beyond compare: You've won my heart, Now this will be my prayer.


[Verse 2] 
'Take the world but give me Jesus!' You're the treasure in this life. 'Take the world but give me Jesus!' Is my cry. Now I've seen You as the Saviour, I will leave the rest behind: 'Take the world but give me Jesus!' Is my cry.


[Verse 3] 
Into the world I'll go That I might live this life of love. I won't be overcome, For You are in me and You are strong. For time and for eternity I know I'm in Your care; You've won my heart, Now this will be my prayer.


[Verse 4] 
'Take the world but give me Jesus!' You're the treasure in this life. 'Take the world but give me Jesus!' Is my cry. Now I've seen You as the Saviour, I will leave the rest behind: 'Take the world but give me Jesus!' Is my cry.
