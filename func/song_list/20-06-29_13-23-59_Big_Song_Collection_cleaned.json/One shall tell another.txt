[Verse 1] 
One shall tell another, And he shall tell his friend, Husbands, wives and children Shall come following on. From house to house in families Shall more be gathered in, And lights will shine in every street, So warm and welcoming.


[Verse 2] 
Come on in and taste the new wine, The wine of the kingdom, The wine of the kingdom of God. Here is healing and forgiveness, The wine of the kingdom, The wine of the kingdom of God.


[Verse 3] 
Compassion of the Father Is ready now to flow, Through acts of love and mercy We must let it show. He turns now from His anger To show a smiling face, And longs that men should stand beneath The fountain of His grace.


[Verse 4] 
Come on in and taste the new wine, The wine of the kingdom, The wine of the kingdom of God. Here is healing and forgiveness, The wine of the kingdom, The wine of the kingdom of God.


[Verse 5] 
He longs to do much more than Our faith has yet allowed, To thrill us and surprise us With His sovereign power. Where darkness has been darkest The brightest light will shine, His invitation comes to us, It's yours and it is mine. 


[Verse 6] 
Come on in and taste the new wine, The wine of the kingdom, The wine of the kingdom of God. Here is healing and forgiveness, The wine of the kingdom, The wine of the kingdom of God.
