[Verse 1] 
[E]Hungry, I come [C#m]to You for I [B]know You satis[A]fy, [E]I am empty, [C#m]but I know Your [B]love does not run [A]dry;


[Verse 2] 
So I [B]wait for [A/C#]You; so I [B/D#]wait for [A]You


[Verse 3] 
[E]I'm falling on my [A]knees, [E]Offering all of [A]me; [E]Jesus, You're all this [A]heart is living [E]for.


[Verse 4] 
[E]Broken, I run [C#m]to You for Your [B]arms are open [A]wide, [E]I am weary, [C#m]but I know Your [B]touch restores my [A]life;


[Verse 5] 
So I [B]wait for [A/C#]You; so I [B/D#]wait for [A]You


[Verse 6] 
[E]I'm falling on my [A]knees, [E]Offering all of [A]me; [E]Jesus, You're all this [A]heart is living [E]for.


[Verse 7] 
So I [B]wait for [A/C#]You; so I [B/D#]wait for [A]You


[Verse 8] 
[E]I'm falling on my [A]knees, [E]Offering all of [A]me; [E]Jesus, You're all this [A]heart is living [E]for.
