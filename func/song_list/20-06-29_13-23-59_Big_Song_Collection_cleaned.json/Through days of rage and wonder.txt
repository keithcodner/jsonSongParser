[Verse 1] 
Through days of rage and wonder We pursue the end of time, To seize the day eternal, The reign of love divine.


[Verse 2] 
Fixing our eyes on Jesus, We will press on day by day. This world's vain passing pleasures Are not our destiny.


[Verse 3] 
Our ancient rites of passage Still are the bread and wine: Our hope a cross that towers Over the wrecks of time.


[Verse 4] 
Through days of rage and wonder, By the awesome power of prayer God will shake every nation, Secrets will be laid bare. And if His light increasing Casts deeper shadows here, Safe in His holy presence, Love will cast out our fear.


[Verse 5] 
Our ancient rites of passage Still are the bread and wine: Our hope a cross that towers Over the wrecks of time.


[Verse 6] 
Through days of rage and wonder, You will give us strength to stand And seek a heavenly city Not built by human hands. Now is the only moment Within our power to change: To give back in obedience While life and breath remain.


[Verse 7] 
Our ancient rites of passage Still are the bread and wine: Our hope a cross that towers Over the wrecks of time.
