[Verse 1] 
O changeless Christ, for ever new, Who walked our earthly ways, Still draw our hearts as once You drew The hearts of other days.


[Verse 2] 
As once You spoke by plain and hill Or taught by shore and sea, So be today our Teacher still, O Christ of Galilee.


[Verse 3] 
As wind and storm their Master heard And His command fulfilled, May troubled hearts receive Your word, The tempest-tossed be stilled.


[Verse 4] 
And as of old to all who prayed Your healing hand was shown, So be Your touch upon us laid, Unseen but not unknown.


[Verse 5] 
In broken bread, in wine outpoured, Your new and living way Proclaim to us, O risen Lord, O Christ of this our day.


[Verse 6] 
O changeless Christ, till life is past Your blessing still be given; Then bring us home, to taste at last The timeless joys of heaven.
