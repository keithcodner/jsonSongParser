[Verse 1] 
Almighty God, Holy one, Who can stand before You, Who can come? Perfect Lamb, who bore our sin, Who deserves such mercy, Gracious King?


[Verse 2] 
I come to Your throne of grace, I'm standing in Christ, I'm clothed in His righteousness. To know Your presence, To seek Your face. Father, I delight in Your embrace.
