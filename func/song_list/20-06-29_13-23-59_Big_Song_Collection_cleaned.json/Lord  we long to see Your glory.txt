[Verse 1] 
Lord, we long to see Your glory, Lord, we long to feel Your power. In these times of refreshing, We long to know You more. To behold You in Your majesty, Our hearts are filled with joy; As we look towards the coming King, We cry 'Lord, let Your glory fall.'


[Verse 2] 
There'll be a day when we will reign with Him, The Bride of Christ born for perfect unity with Him. We shall see Him face to face, But until that day we shall pray, 'Show us Your glory.'


[Verse 3] 
Help us to sing like the angels sing. Help us to praise in the courts of our King. Help us to dance like David danced, Stirred by the love of Your Son, Stirred by the love of Your Son.
