[Verse 1] 
Sweet fellowship, Jesus in the midst, Life blossoms in the church, Men by men are blessed When Jesus is in the midst.


[Verse 2] 
Peace and harmony - Jesus reigning here; The church moves at His command, No room for doubt or fear, For Jesus is reigning here.


[Verse 3] 
I've never known a time like this, Feel the spirit within me rise. Come and see what God is doing. Lord, we love You.


[Verse 4] 
Sweet fellowship, Jesus in the midst, Life blossoms in the church, Men by men are blessed When Jesus is in the midst.
