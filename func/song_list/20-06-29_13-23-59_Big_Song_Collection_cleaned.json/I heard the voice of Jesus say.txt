[Verse 1] 
I heard the voice of Jesus say: 'Come unto Me and rest; Lay down, thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon My breast.' I came to Jesus as I was, Weary and worn and sad; I found in Him a resting place, And He has made me glad.


[Verse 2] 
I heard the voice of Jesus say: 'Behold I freely give The living water, thirsty one, Stoop down and drink and live.' I came to Jesus, and I drank Of that life-giving stream; My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, And now I live in Him.


[Verse 3] 
I heard the voice of Jesus say: 'I am this dark world's light; Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise, And all thy day be bright.' I looked to Jesus, and I found In Him my Star, my Sun; And in that light of life I'll walk, Till travelling days are done.
