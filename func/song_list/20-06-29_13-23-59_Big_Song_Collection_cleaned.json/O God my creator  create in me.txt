[Verse 1] 
O God my creator, create in me That river of water that flows full and free. Let it bring life to the dead and stagnant sea; Spring up, O well, and flow on out of me.


[Verse 2] 
We come to the throne Where flows the living stream, And drink from the water, And drink from the water, And drink from the water that flows from Thee.


[Verse 3] 
O God my Creator, create in me That new way of living that flows full and free. Let it bring life to the wilderness of man; Spring up, O well, and flood this thirsty land. 


[Verse 4] 
We come to the throne Where flows the living stream, And drink from the water, And drink from the water, And drink from the water that flows from Thee.
