[Verse 1] 
The name of the Lord is a strong tower; The name of the Lord brings refuge and strength. The name of the Lord gives hope to the hopeless; The name of the Lord breathes life to the dead.


[Verse 2] 
The name of the Lord give strength to the weary, The name of the Lord brings freedom from fear; The name of the Lord gives peace to the restless, The name of the Lord will heal the oppressed.


[Verse 3] 
O Lord, You never change, Holy God, You remain the same, For Your love, it never fades, Your faithfulness surrounds me.


[Verse 4] 
For You alone are God, and I bow before You. You alone are God, I worship, adore You. You alone are God, none other before You, And I offer up my life again.


[Verse 5] 
The name of the Lord covers me with mercy, The name of the Lord brings everlasting joy; The name of the Lord will lift all myburdens, The name of the Lord, it makes mecomplete.


[Verse 6] 
I call, and You answer me, For You know my every need. In Your love I put my trust, Your faithfulness surrounds me.


[Verse 7] 
O taste and see That the Lord is good. How blessed is the man Who hides himself in Him. 


[Verse 8] 
For You alone are God, and I bow before You. You alone are God, I worship, adore You. You alone are God, none other before You, And I offer up my life again.
