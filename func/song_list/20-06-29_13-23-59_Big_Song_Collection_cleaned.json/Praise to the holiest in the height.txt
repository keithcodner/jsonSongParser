[Verse 1] 
Praise to the holiest in the height, And in the depth be praise; In all His words most wonderful, Most sure in all His ways.


[Verse 2] 
O loving wisdom of our God! When all was sin and shame, A second Adam to the fight And to the rescue came.


[Verse 3] 
O wisest love! that flesh and blood, Which did in Adam fail, Should strive afresh against the foe, Should strive and should prevail;


[Verse 4] 
And that a higher gift than grace Should flesh and blood refine, God's presence and His very self, And essence all-divine.


[Verse 5] 
O generous love! that He, who smote In Man for man the foe, The double agony in Man For man should undergo;


[Verse 6] 
And in the garden secretly, And on the cross on high, Should teach His brethren, and inspire To suffer and to die.


[Verse 7] 
Praise to the Holiest in the height, And to the depth be praise; In all His words most wonderful, Most sure in all His ways.
