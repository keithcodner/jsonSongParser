[Verse 1] 
I've got joy...JOY! Deep down in my soul I've love...LOVE! My Saviour made me whole


[Verse 2] 
I've got peace...PEACE! Peace that blows your mind I've got hope... HOPE! That'll last for all time


[Verse 3] 
So let me tell you something now My Father looks at me and says


[Verse 4] 
Bow chikka wah wah
