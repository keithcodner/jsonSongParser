[Verse 1] 
[G]I stand amazed in the presence [D]Of Je[C2]sus [G]the Nazarene, [C2]And wonder [G/B]how He could love me, [G]A sinne[D]r, con[G]demned, unclean.


[Verse 2] 
[G]How marvelous! How wonderful! [D]And my song shall ever be: [G]How [D/F#]marve[Em7]lous! How wonderful! [Am7]Is my [G/B]Savior's [Dsus]love [D]for [G]me!


[Verse 3] 
For me it was in the garden He prayed: "Not My will, but Thine." He had no tears for His own greifs, But sweat drops of blood for mine.


[Verse 4] 
[G]How marvelous! How wonderful! [D]And my song shall ever be: [G]How [D/F#]marve[Em7]lous! How wonderful! [Am7]Is my [G/B]Savior's [Dsus]love [D]for [G]me!


[Verse 5] 
In pity angels beheld Him And came from the world of light To comfort Him in the sorrows He bore for my soul that night.


[Verse 6] 
[G]How marvelous! How wonderful! [D]And my song shall ever be: [G]How [D/F#]marve[Em7]lous! How wonderful! [Am7]Is my [G/B]Savior's [Dsus]love [D]for [G]me!


[Verse 7] 
He took my sins and my sorrows, He made them His very own; He bore the burden to Calvary And suffered and died alone.


[Verse 8] 
[G]How marvelous! How wonderful! [D]And my song shall ever be: [G]How [D/F#]marve[Em7]lous! How wonderful! [Am7]Is my [G/B]Savior's [Dsus]love [D]for [G]me!


[Verse 9] 
When with the ransmed in glory His face I at last shall see, 'Twill be my joy through the ages To sing of His love for me.


[Verse 10] 
[G]How marvelous! How wonderful! [D]And my song shall ever be: [G]How [D/F#]marve[Em7]lous! How wonderful! [Am7]Is my [G/B]Savior's [Dsus]love [D]for [G]me!
