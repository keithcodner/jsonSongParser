[Verse 1] 
Soldiers of Christ, arise, And put your armour on; Strong in the strength which God supplies, Through His eternal Son;


[Verse 2] 
Strong in the Lord of hosts, And in His mighty power; Who in the strength of Jesus trusts Is more than conqueror.


[Verse 3] 
Stand, then, in His great might, With all His strength endued; And take, to arm you for the fight, The panoply of God.


[Verse 4] 
Leave no unguarded place, No weakness of the soul; Take every virtue, every grace, And fortify the whole.


[Verse 5] 
From strength to strength go on, Wrestle and fight and pray; Tread all the powers of darkness down, And win the well-fought day.


[Verse 6] 
That having all things done, And all your conflicts past, Ye may o'ercome, through Christ alone, And stand complete at last.
