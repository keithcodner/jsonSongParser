[Verse 1] 
 God above all the world in motion God above all my hopes and fears And I don't care what the world throws at me now I'm gonna be all right


[Verse 2] 
 Hear the sound of the gene - rations Making loud their freedom song All in all that the world would know Your name We're gonna be all right


[Verse 3] 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day And I know His word never fails And I know my God made a way for me Salvation is here


[Verse 4] 
 Salvation is here Salvation is here, and He lives in me Salvation is here Salvation that died just to set me free|| Salvation is here Salvation is here, and He lives in me Salvation is here|| 'Cause You are alive, and You live in me Salvation is here Salvation is here and He lives in me Salvation is here 'Cause You are alive and You live in me


[Verse 5] 
 I know my God saved the day And I know His word never fails And I know my God made a way for me It's gonna be alright|| 'Cause I know my God saved the day And I know His word never fails And I know my God made a way for me Salvation is here


[Verse 6] 
 Salvation is here Salvation is here and He lives in me Salvation is here 'Cause You are alive and You live in me Salvation is here
