[Verse 1] 
I have a maker, He formed my heart; Before even time began My life was in His hand.


[Verse 2] 
I have a Father, He calls me His own; He'll never leave me, No matter where I go.


[Verse 3] 
He knows my name, He knows my every thought; He sees each tear that falls, And hears me when I call.
