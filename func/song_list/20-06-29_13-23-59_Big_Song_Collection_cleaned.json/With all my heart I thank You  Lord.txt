[Verse 1] 
With all my heart I thank You, Lord. With all my heart I thank You, Lord, For this bread and wine we break, For this sacrament we take, For the forgiveness that You make, I thank You, Lord.


[Verse 2] 
With all my soul I thank You, Lord. With all my soul I thank You, Lord, For this victory that You've won, For this taste of things to come, For this love that makes us one, I thank You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
With all my voice I thank You, Lord. With all my voice I thank You, Lord, For the sacrifice of pain, For the Spirit and the flame, For the power of Your name, I thank You, Lord.
