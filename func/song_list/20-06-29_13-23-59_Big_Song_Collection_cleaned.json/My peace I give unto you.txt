[Verse 1] 
My peace I give unto you, It's a peace that the world cannot give, It's a peace that the world cannot understand: Peace to know, peace to live, My peace I give unto you.


[Verse 2] 
My joy I give unto you, It's a joy that the world cannot give, It's a joy that the world cannot understand: Joy to know, joy to live, My joy I give unto you.


[Verse 3] 
My love I give unto you, It's a love that the world cannot give, It's a love that the world cannot understand: Love to know, love to live, My love I give unto you.
