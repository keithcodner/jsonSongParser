[Verse 1] 
Once I was far away, But now my life is found in You. Once I was without hope, But now I have a vision of heaven.


[Verse 2] 
Fallen from grace; By faith lifted up; Now I believe 


[Verse 3] 
No height, no depth can keep us From the love of Christ. No life, no death, no trial Can tear us from The love of God in Christ.


[Verse 4] 
How wonderful the love Our Father God has given us, That we could still be called Children of God. 


[Verse 5] 
No height, no depth can keep us From the love of Christ. No life, no death, no trial Can tear us from The love of God in Christ.
