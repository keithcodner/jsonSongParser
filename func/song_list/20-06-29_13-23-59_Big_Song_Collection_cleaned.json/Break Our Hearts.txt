[Verse 1] 
Break[G] our he[C]arts, oh God. Break[D] our [C]hearts. Break[G] our he[C]arts, oh God. Break[D] our [C]hearts. For [G]the sin in[C] our lives, [D]brea[C]k our hearts. For [G]the sin in[C] our lives, [D]brea[C]k our hearts.


[Verse 2] 
We [G]cry out, we [C]need Your help. [D]Come back to [G]our land. We[G] confess, we'[C]ve lived in sin. Please show us Your po[C]wer [D]once [G]again.
