[Verse 1] 
When we walk with the Lord In the light of His word, What a glory He sheds on our way! While we do His good will, He abides with us still, And with all who will trust and obey!


[Verse 2] 
Trust and obey! For there's no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.


[Verse 3] 
Not a shadow can rise, Not a cloud in the skies, But His smile quickly drives it away; Not a doubt nor a fear, Not a sigh nor a tear, Can abide while we trust and obey!


[Verse 4] 
Trust and obey! For there's no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.


[Verse 5] 
Not a burden we bear, Not a sorrow we share, But our toil He doth richly repay: Not a grief nor a loss, Not a frown nor a cross, But is blessed if we trust and obey!


[Verse 6] 
Trust and obey! For there's no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.


[Verse 7] 
But we never can prove The delights of His love Until all on the altar we lay; For the favour He shows, And the joy He bestows, Are for those who will trust and obey.


[Verse 8] 
Trust and obey! For there's no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.


[Verse 9] 
Then in fellowship sweet We will sit at His feet, Or we'll walk by His side in the way; What He says we will do, Where He sends we will go; Never fear, only trust and obey! 


[Verse 10] 
Trust and obey! For there's no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.
