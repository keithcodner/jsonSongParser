[Verse 1] 
How can I be free from sin? Lead me to the cross of Jesus. From the guilt, the power, the pain? Lead me to the cross of Jesus. ||There's no other way, No price that I could pay; Simply to the cross I cling. This is all I need, This is all I plead, That His blood was shed for me.


[Verse 2] 
How can I know peace within? Lead me to the cross of Jesus. Sing a song of joy again! Lead me to the cross of Jesus. ||Flowing from above, All-forgiving love From the Father's heart to me! What a gift of grace - His own righteousness Clothing me in purity!


[Verse 3] 
How can I live day by day? Lead me to the cross of Jesus. Following His narrow way? Lead me to the cross of Jesus.
