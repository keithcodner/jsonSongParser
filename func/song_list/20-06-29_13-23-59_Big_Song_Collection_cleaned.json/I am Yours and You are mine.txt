[Verse 1] 
I am Yours And You are mine, Friend to me For all of time.


[Verse 2] 
And all I have now I give to You. And all I want now Is to be pure, pure like You.


[Verse 3] 
I'm not afraid Of earthly things, For I am safe With You, my King. 


[Verse 4] 
And all I have now I give to You. And all I want now Is to be pure, pure like You.
