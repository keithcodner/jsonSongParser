[Verse 1] 
I am the APPLE of God's eye, His BANANA over me is love. He ORANGES His angels to look after me, As His blessings PLUM-met from above.


[Verse 2] 
Never have to play the GOOSEBERRY, Feel like a LEMON, no not me. For wherever this MAN-GOES, A RASPBERRY it never blows.


[Verse 3] 
The GREAT FRUIT of God, The GREAT FRUIT of God, The GREAT FRUIT of God it overflows. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
I will praise Him on the TANGERINE, Praise Him on the MANDARIN; SATSUMA or later you will see There is always a CLEMENTINEfor praising Him. 


[Verse 5] 
The GREAT FRUIT of God, The GREAT FRUIT of God, The GREAT FRUIT of God it overflows. (Repeat)
