[Verse 1] 
He made the earth, He made the sky, He made the moon and the stars, Jupiter and Mars. He made the sun for everyone, Our God made them all. ||Our God is powerful, powerful, Our God is great. Our God is powerful, powerful, Our God is great.


[Verse 2] 
He made the fish, He made the birds, Elephants and worms, Creeping things that squirm. Mice so small, giraffes so tall; Our God made them all. ||Our God is wonderful, wonderful, Our God is great. Our God is wonderful, wonderful, Our God is great.


[Verse 3] 
He made the boys, he made the girls, He made our mums and dads, To teach us good from bad. He cares for me, He cares for You; Our God loves us all. ||Our God is beautiful, beautiful, Our God is great. Our God is beautiful, beautiful, Our God is great.
