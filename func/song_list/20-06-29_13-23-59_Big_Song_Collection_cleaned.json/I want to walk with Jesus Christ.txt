[Verse 1] 
I want to walk with Jesus Christ All the days I live of this life on earth; To give to Him complete control Of body and of soul.


[Verse 2] 
Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him, He has conquered death, He is King of kings; Accept the joy which He gives to those Who yield their lives to Him.


[Verse 3] 
I want to learn to speak to Him, To pray to Him, confess my sin; To open my life and let Him in, For joy will then be mine:


[Verse 4] 
Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him, He has conquered death, He is King of kings; Accept the joy which He gives to those Who yield their lives to Him.


[Verse 5] 
I want to learn to speak of Him, My life must show that He lives in me; My deeds, my thoughts, my words must speak All of His love for me:


[Verse 6] 
Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him, He has conquered death, He is King of kings; Accept the joy which He gives to those Who yield their lives to Him.


[Verse 7] 
I want to learn to read His word, For this is how I know the way To live my life as pleases Him, In holiness and joy:


[Verse 8] 
Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him, He has conquered death, He is King of kings; Accept the joy which He gives to those Who yield their lives to Him.


[Verse 9] 
O Holy Spirit of the Lord, Enter now into this heart of mine; Take full control of my selfish will, And make me wholly Thine: 


[Verse 10] 
Follow Him, follow Him, yield your life to Him, He has conquered death, He is King of kings; Accept the joy which He gives to those Who yield their lives to Him.
