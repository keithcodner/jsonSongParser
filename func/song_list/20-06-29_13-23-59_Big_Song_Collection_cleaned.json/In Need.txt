[Verse 1] 
In need of grace. In need of love. In need of mercy raining down From high above.|| In need of strength. In need of peace. In need of things That only You can give to me.


[Verse 2] 
In need of Christ, the perfect Lamb, My refuge strong, the Great I AM. This is my song, my humble plea; I am Your child, I am in need.


[Verse 3] 
In need of grace. In need of love. In need of mercy raining down From high above.|| In need of strength. In need of peace. In need of things That only You can give to me.


[Verse 4] 
In need of Christ, the perfect Lamb, My refuge strong, the Great I AM. This is my song, my humble plea; I am Your child, I am in need.
