[Verse 1] 
O [G]Love that [D]will not [C]let me [G]go,[D] I [Em]rest my [G]weary [C]soul in [D]thee; I [G]give thee [D]back the [C]life I [G]owe,[D] That [Em]in thine [G]ocean [C]depths its [D]flow May r[Am]icher, f[Em]uller [D]be.[C][G][D]


[Verse 2] 
O Light that follows all my way, I yield my flickering torch to thee; My heart restores its borrowed ray, That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day May brighter, fairer be.


[Verse 3] 
O Joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee; I trace the rainbow through the rain, And feel the promise is not vain, That morn shall tearless be.


[Verse 4] 
O Cross that liftest up my head, I dare not ask to fly from thee; I lay in dust life’s glory dead, And from the ground there blossoms red Life that shall endless be.


[Verse 5] 
O [G]Love that [D]will not [C]let me [G]go,[D] I [Em]rest my [G]weary [C]soul in [D]thee; I [G]give thee [D]back the [C]life I [G]owe,[D] That [Em]in thine [G]ocean [C]depths its [D]flow May r[Am]icher, f[Em]uller [D]be.[C][G][D]
