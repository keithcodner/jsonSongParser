[Verse 1] 
You are the perfect and righteous God Whose presence bears no sin; You bid me come to Your holy place: How can I enter in When Your presence bears no sin? ||Through Him who poured out His life for me, The atoning Lamb of God, Through Him and His work alone I boldly come.


[Verse 2] 
I come by the blood, I come by the cross, Where Your mercy flows From hands pierced for me. For I dare not stand on my righteousness, My every hope rests on what Christ has done, And I come by the blood.


[Verse 3] 
You are the high and exalted King, The One the angels fear; So far above me in every way, Lord, how can I draw near To the One the angels fear? ||Through Him who laid down His life for me And ascended to Your side, Through Him, through Jesus alone I boldly come. 


[Verse 4] 
I come by the blood, I come by the cross, Where Your mercy flows From hands pierced for me. For I dare not stand on my righteousness, My every hope rests on what Christ has done, And I come by the blood.
