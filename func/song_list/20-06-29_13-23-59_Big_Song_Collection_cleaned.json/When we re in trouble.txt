[Verse 1] 
When we're in trouble, When there are cares; When faith is shaken up, When we despair, We call on Jesus, Give Him our thanks; We let His peace and joy Come to our hearts.


[Verse 2] 
We're gonna keep on praying, Keep on praying. We're gonna keep on praying, Keep on praying.


[Verse 3] 
When there is sickness, When there is pain, There is a healing touch, Each time we pray. God always listens, Cares for our needs; Prayers of the righteous one Have power indeed.


[Verse 4] 
We're gonna keep on praying, Keep on praying. We're gonna keep on praying, Keep on praying.


[Verse 5] 
Prayers for the nation, Prayers for the world. Prayers for the government, Prayers for the church. Prayers for the seekers, Prayers for the saints, Praying that people will come to faith. 


[Verse 6] 
We're gonna keep on praying, Keep on praying. We're gonna keep on praying, Keep on praying.
