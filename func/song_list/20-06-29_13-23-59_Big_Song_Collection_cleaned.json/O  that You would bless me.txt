[Verse 1] 
O, that You would bless me, And enlarge my borders, That Your hand would be with me, O Lord, O Lord. O, that You would keep me, Keep me from all evil, So that I may not be ashamed, O Lord, O Lord.


[Verse 2] 
May Your kingdom come, May Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven; May Your kingdom come, May Your will be done Through me, O Lord, O Lord.


[Verse 3] 
O, that You would fill me, Fill me with Your Spirit, So that I may know Your power, O Lord, O Lord. O, that You would use me To fulfil Your purposes, That through me Your glory would shine, O Lord, O Lord. 


[Verse 4] 
May Your kingdom come, May Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven; May Your kingdom come, May Your will be done Through me, O Lord, O Lord.
