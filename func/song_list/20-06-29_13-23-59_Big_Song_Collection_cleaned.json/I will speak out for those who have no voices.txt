[Verse 1] 
I will speak out for those who have no voices, I will stand up for the rights of all the oppressed; I will speak truth and justice, I'll defend the poor and the needy, I will lift up the weak in Jesus' name.


[Verse 2] 
I will speak out for those who have no choices, I will cry out for those who live without love; I will show God's compassion To the crushed and broken in spirit, I will lift up the weak in Jesus' name.
