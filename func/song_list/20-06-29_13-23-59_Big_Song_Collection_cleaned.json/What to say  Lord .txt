[Verse 1] 
What to say, Lord? It's You who gave me life, And I can't explain just how much You mean to me Now that You have saved me, Lord. I give all that I am to You, That every day I can be a light that shines Your name.


[Verse 2] 
Every day, Lord, I'll learn to stand upon Your word, And I pray that I, That I may come to know You more, That You would guide me In every single step I take, That every day I can be Your light unto the world.


[Verse 3] 
Every day, it's You I'll live for, Every day, I'll follow after You. Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord.


[Verse 4] 
What to say, Lord? It's You who gave me life, And I can't explain just how much You mean to me Now that You have saved me, Lord. I give all that I am to You, That every day I can be a light that shines Your name.
