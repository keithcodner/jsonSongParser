[Verse 1] 
You have laid Your hand on me, I am changed forever; There is nothing that compares With knowing You. You have spoken words of love That lift my Spirit higher; Jesus Christ, my dearest friend, I'm never letting go. 


[Verse 2] 
How can I live, how can I live, How can I live without Your love? How can I live, how can I live, How can I live without Your love? 


[Verse 3] 
Help me never to forget What I used to be, Though the past that I regret Is over now. I will never be ashamed Of calling You my friend. I no longer hide from You, I'm running to Your side. 


[Verse 4] 
How can I live, how can I live, How can I live without Your love? How can I live, how can I live, How can I live without Your love? 


[Verse 5] 
All the riches I possess Are meaningless to me; Your love is the greatest gift, The very air I breathe. 


[Verse 6] 
How can I live, how can I live, How can I live without Your love? How can I live, how can I live, How can I live without Your love?
