[Verse 1] 
Let the poor man say, I am rich in Him; Let the lost man say I am found in Him: Let the river flow. Let the blind man say, I can see again; Let that dead man say, I am born again: Let the river flow.


[Verse 2] 
Let the river flow, Let the river flow, Let the river flow. Holy Spirit, come; Move in power. Let the river flow. (Let the river flow)
