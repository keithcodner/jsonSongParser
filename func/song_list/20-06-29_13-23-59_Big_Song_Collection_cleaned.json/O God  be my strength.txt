[Verse 1] 
O God, be my strength Through my doubt and my fear. O God, be my comfort When darkness is near. O Lord of all hope, You're my Saviour and Guide. O Lord, have mercy on me.


[Verse 2] 
O God of all mercy And God of all grace, Whose infinite gift Was to die in my place, Eternal Creator, Redeemer and Friend, O Lord, have mercy on me.


[Verse 3] 
O God of all power, Invisible King, Restorer of man, My life I bring, O Lord of my heart, Grant Your peace now I pray: O Lord, have mercy on me.
