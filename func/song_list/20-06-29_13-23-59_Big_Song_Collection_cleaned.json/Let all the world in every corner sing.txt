[Verse 1] 
Let all the world in every corner sing: 'My God and King!' The heavens are not too high; His praise may thither fly: The earth is not too low; His praises there may grow. Let all the world in every corner sing: 'My God and King!'


[Verse 2] 
Let all the world in every corner sing: 'My God and King!' The Church with psalms must shout, No door can keep them out: But, above all, the heart Must bear the longest part. Let all the world in every corner sing: 'My God and King!'
