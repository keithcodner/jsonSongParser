[Verse 1] 
[D]When I survey the [G]wondrous [D]cross [D]on which the [G]Prince of [D]glory [A]died, [D]My richest gain I [G]count but [D]loss, [D]and pour con[A]tempt on [G]all my [D]pride.


[Verse 2] 
[D]See from His head, His [G]hands, His [D]feet, [D]sorrow and [G]love flow [D]mingled [A]down: [D]Did eâ€™er such love and [G]sorrow [D]meet, [D]or thorns com[A]pose so [G]rich a [D]crown?


[Verse 3] 
Oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, Bids me [G]come and die and [D]find that I may [A]truly live;|| Oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, All who [G]gather here by [D]grace draw near and [A]bless Your name.


[Verse 4] 
[D]Were the whole realm of [G]nature [D]mine, [D]that were an [G]offering [D]far too [A]small; [D]Love so amazing, [G]so di[D]vine, [D]demands my [A]soul, my [G]life, my [D]all!


[Verse 5] 
Oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, Bids me [G]come and die and [D]find that I may [A]truly live;|| Oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, oh the [G]wonderful [D]cross, All who [G]gather here by [D]grace draw near and [A]bless Your name.


[Verse 6] 
[D]Were the whole realm of [G]nature [D]mine, [D]that were an [G]offering [D]far too [A]small; [D]Love so amazing, [G]so di[D]vine, [D]demands my [A]soul, my [G]life, my [D]all!
