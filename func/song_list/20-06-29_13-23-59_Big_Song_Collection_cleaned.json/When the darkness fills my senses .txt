[Verse 1] 
When the darkness fills my senses, When my blindness keeps me from Your touch, Jesus come. When my burden keeps me doubting, When my memories take the place of You, Jesus come.


[Verse 2] 
And I'll follow You there, To the place where we meet, And I'll lay down my pride As You search me again. Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love over me again.
