[Verse 1] 
In the bleak midwinter, Frosty wind made moan; Earth stood hard as iron, Water like a stone. Snow had fallen, snow on snow, Snow on snow; In the bleak midwinter, Long ago.


[Verse 2] 
Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, Nor earth sustain, Heaven and earth shall flee away When He comes to reign. In the bleak midwinter A stable-place sufficed The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.


[Verse 3] 
Angels and archangels May have gathered there, Cherubim and seraphim Thronged the air. But His mother only, In her maiden bliss, Worshipped the Beloved With a kiss.


[Verse 4] 
What can I give Him, Poor as I am? If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb. If I were a wise man, I would do my part; Yet what I can I give Him - Give my heart.
