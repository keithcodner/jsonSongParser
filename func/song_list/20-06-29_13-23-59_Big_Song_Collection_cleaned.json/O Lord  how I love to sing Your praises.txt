[Verse 1] 
O Lord, how I love to sing Your praises. O Lord, how I love to dance for You. O Lord, You have captured my affection, Forever I will sing of Your love, Forever I will bring to You my life, Forever I will worship You.


[Verse 2] 
And when I think of what You've done, It makes me shout for joy. And when I think of what's to come, Living forever in Your presence, Face to face with my magnificent obsession, Forever, forever I will be with You.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, la, la, la ... Oh, la, la, la ... Oh, la, la, la ... Forever, forever I will be with You.
