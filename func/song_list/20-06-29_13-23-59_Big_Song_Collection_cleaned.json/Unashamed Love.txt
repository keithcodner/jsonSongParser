[Verse 1] 
You're [G]callin' me to lay aside the wo[C6]rries of my day, To [Em7]quiet down my busy mind and fi[C]nd a hiding place. W[G/B]orthy [C2]-- You are [Em7]worthy![C2]|| I o[G]pen up my heart and let my spi[C6]rit worship Yours. I [Em7]open up my mouth and let a son[C]g of praise come forth. W[G/B]orthy [C2]-- You are [Em7]worthy![C2]


[Verse 2] 
[G]Of a childlike faith, [C2]of my honest praise, And [Em7]of my unashamed lov[C2]e. [G]Of a holy life, [C2]of my sacrifice, And [Em7]of my unashamed l[G/C]ove.
