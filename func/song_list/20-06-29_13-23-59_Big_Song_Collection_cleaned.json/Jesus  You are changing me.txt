[Verse 1] 
Jesus, You are changing me, By Your Spirit You're making me like You. Jesus, You're transforming me, That Your loveliness May be seen in all I do.


[Verse 2] 
You are the potter And I am the clay, Help me to be willing To let You have Your way. Jesus, You are changing me, As I let You reign supreme Within my heart.
