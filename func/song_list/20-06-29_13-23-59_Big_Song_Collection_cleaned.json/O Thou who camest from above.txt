[Verse 1] 
O Thou who camest from above The pure celestial fire to impart, Kindle a flame of sacred love On the mean altar of my heart.


[Verse 2] 
There let it for Thy glory burn With inextinguishable blaze, And trembling to its source return, In humble prayer and fervent praise.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, confirm my heart's desire To work, and speak, and think for Thee; Still let me guard the holy fire, And still stir up Thy gift in me.


[Verse 4] 
Ready for all Thy perfect will, My acts of faith and love repeat, Till death Thy endless mercies seal, And make the sacrifice complete.
