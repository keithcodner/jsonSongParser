[Verse 1] 
You came into my life, A Saviour to my soul; You set a hope within this heart of mine. You said that I am Yours, That You will never leave me. Now I surrender all I am to You. 


[Verse 2] 
I will never know why You chose me, God, But You did. I will never know why You took that cross, But You did, yes, You did. 


[Verse 3] 
While today is still today I'll live just for Your praise, A living sacrifice; Holding out to be Faithful unto You, So in my life be glorified, I pray.


[Verse 4] 
In You, O Lord, I trust, In You, O Lord, I live; Do not let me stray from Your commands. Guide me in Your way, Protect me in Your truth, Teach me what it means to follow You.


[Verse 5] 
While today is still today I'll live just for Your praise, A living sacrifice; Holding out to be Faithful unto You, So in my life be glorified, I pray.
