[Verse 1] 
We see the Lord, And He is high upon the throne, And His glory fills the heavens and the earth. One like a Lamb Who was slain is on the throne, And so I cast my crown before You And bow down to praise.


[Verse 2] 
For everything cries holy. Oh, everything cries holy. Oh, everything cries holy to You, Lord. (repeat)
