[Verse 1] 
Like a gentle breeze, like a mighty wind, Like a roaring fire, You will visit us, you will cleanse our souls, And our hearts inspire, ||Bringing peace to us, like a healing balm, Or a gentle dove; O come to us, O bring to us God's gifts of love.


[Verse 2] 
Come with holy fire, Melt these hearts of clay. Let them beat with love That will never fade. Holy Spirit come, Holy Spirit come, Holy Spirit come again.
