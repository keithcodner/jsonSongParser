[Verse 1] 
I want to know The glorious inheritance That You have given to me. And I want to know The hope that You have called me to, O Lord, I want to know Your truth.


[Verse 2] 
I want to know You better, The Spirit without measure, To know the fulness that's in You. I want to know Your mystery, The grace You've given freely, I know my life is hidden in You.


[Verse 3] 
I want to know Your wisdom and Your revelation, Drawing me to You. I want to know The power of Your mighty strength Which raised Jesus from the dead. 


[Verse 4] 
I want to know You better, The Spirit without measure, To know the fulness that's in You. I want to know Your mystery, The grace You've given freely, I know my life is hidden in You.
