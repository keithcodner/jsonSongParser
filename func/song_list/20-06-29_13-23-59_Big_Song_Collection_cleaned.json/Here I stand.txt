[Verse 1] 
Here I stand, longing to meet with God; I have come, bringing a grateful heart. And I will sing of this amazing love again. Here I am, falling before Your throne, For my King laying down any crown, And I'll sing of this amazing love again.


[Verse 2] 
Here I am before Your throne of grace; I can come, for You have made a way, And I'll sing of this amazing love again. Here I am, so overwhelmed by You; I come near, for I belong to You, And I'll sing of this amazing love again.


[Verse 3] 
I am in love with God, I am in love with God, I hear You call my name, I give my heart again. I am in love with God, I am in love with God, I hear You call my name, I'm on my knees again.


[Verse 4] 
You have won my heart and I can say That I could find no other way. Now I am Yours, and here I'll stay To offer up this praise.


[Verse 5] 
I am in love with God, I am in love with God, I hear You call my name, I give my heart again. I am in love with God, I am in love with God, I hear You call my name, I'm on my knees again.


[Verse 6] 
I'm in love with You, I'm in love with You.


[Verse 7] 
I am in love with God, I am in love with God, I hear You call my name, I give my heart again. I am in love with God, I am in love with God, I hear You call my name, I'm on my knees again.
