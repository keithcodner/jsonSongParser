[Verse 1] 
Lord, to love You more is all I want, To hear You speaking to my heart, To be consumed by You again. Fix my eyes on You and draw me near, Let all distractions disappear, I need You even more today.


[Verse 2] 
For Jesus, I am overwhelmed By all Your love has done, And all I want to say is that I adore You, Lord. I'm humbled by the grace of God, You met my every need, And Jesus, You will be always my greatest love.


[Verse 3] 
I adore You. I adore You. I adore You. I adore You.
