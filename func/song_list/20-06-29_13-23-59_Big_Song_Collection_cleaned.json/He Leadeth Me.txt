[Verse 1] 
He [D]leadeth me! [D/F#]O [G]blessed thought! O [D]words with heavenly comfort [A]fraught! What[D]e'er I do, [D/F#]where'[G]er I be, Still [D]'tis God's [Bm]hand that [D]lea[A]deth [D]me.


[Verse 2] 
He [D]leadeth [A]me, He [D]lead[G]eth [D]me; By His own [Bm]hand He [D]leadeth [A]me: His [D]faithful [A]follower [D]I [G]would [D]be, For [Bm]by His [D]hand He [A]leadeth [D]me.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, [D]I would clasp [D/F#]Thy [G]hand in mine, Nor [D]ever murmur nor re[A]pine, Con[D]tent, what[D/F#]ever [G]lot I see, Since [D]God through [Bm]Jordan [D]lea[A]deth [D]me.


[Verse 4] 
He [D]leadeth [A]me, He [D]lead[G]eth [D]me; By His own [Bm]hand He [D]leadeth [A]me: His [D]faithful [A]follower [D]I [G]would [D]be, For [Bm]by His [D]hand He [A]leadeth [D]me.


[Verse 5] 
And [D]when my task o[D/F#]n [G]earth is done, When [D]by Thy grace the victory's [A]won, E'en [D]death's cold wave [D/F#]I [G]will not flee, Since [D]God through [Bm]Jordan [D]lea[A]deth [D]me.


[Verse 6] 
He [D]leadeth [A]me, He [D]lead[G]eth [D]me; By His own [Bm]hand He [D]leadeth [A]me: His [D]faithful [A]follower [D]I [G]would [D]be, For [Bm]by His [D]hand He [A]leadeth [D]me.
