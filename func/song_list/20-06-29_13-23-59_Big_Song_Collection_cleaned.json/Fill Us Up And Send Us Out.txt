[Verse 3] 
Bring them from the west, sons and daughters,|Call them for Your praise. Gather from the east all Your children,|Coming home again. Bring them from afar, all the nations, From the north and south,|drawing all the peoples in. Corners of the earth,|come to see there's|only one Saviour and King
