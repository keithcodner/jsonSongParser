[Verse 1] 
[E9]Scorn the use of Jesus [C#m]name, bid farewell to guilt and [D]shame, You assault me with the [A]lie, as I just stand idly [E9]by; I will scream for earthly [C#m]things, but won’t whisper for the [D]King, You are right the Truth is [A]dead, when I keep it in my [E9]head.


[Verse 2] 
[E]Why am [C#m]I afraid of [B]livin’ out the [A]Truth? [E]When I am [C#m]dying of my [B]sin sweetened [A]tooth; [E]Though I [C#m]fall I’ll never [B]fall away from [A]You, so [E]Why am [C#m]I afraid of [B]living out the [A]Truth?


[Verse 3] 
[E9]I forsake my Savior’s [C#m]might, as I push Him from my [D]sight, All alone I choose to [A]stay, hidden deep within my [E9]cave; Could I leave and face the [C#m]storm with a faith that’s so luke[D]warm? It’s a fence too thin to [A]ride, hot or cold I must de[E9]cide.
