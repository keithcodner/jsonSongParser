[Verse 1] 
[E]I stand among the [E]millions[E2], and I can't help but [F#m7]feel so small, For I am just a speck of [D]dust, a particle existing on this great big [E]spinning ball.[Esus] The part of me that's [E]human[E2], it tells me I am [F#m7]not that strong, There's a power in my [D]soul, greater than us all, and I'm reminded I am [E]not my [EsusE]own.


[Verse 2] 
I'm [D2]yielded to a [C#m]higher calling: I'm... [E]One voice, shining through the darkest [C#m7]night. One voice, standing up for what is [A2]right. One voice, nothing more and nothing [F#m7]less, Than a [D]voice crying out, a voice in the wilder[E]ness.


[Verse 3] 
[E]The voices of con[E]fusion[E2], can fill a world that's [F#m7]all my own. Running havoc through my [D]mind, all the truth and all the lies, It's so hard to sift the [E]right from wrong.[Esus] In the middle of the [E]choosing,[E2] through the clutter of this [F#m7]human noise, When my words fall to the [D]ground, all the dust has settled down, All that matters is Your [E]still small [Esus]voice.[E]
