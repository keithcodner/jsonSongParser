[Verse 1] 
Just as I am, without one plea But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come.


[Verse 2] 
Just as I am, and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come.


[Verse 3] 
Just as I am, though tossed about With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God, I come.


[Verse 4] 
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need in Thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come.


[Verse 5] 
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve, Because Thy promise I believe, O Lamb of God, I come.


[Verse 6] 
Just as I am, Thy love unknown Has broken every barrier down; Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, O Lamb of God, I come.


[Verse 7] 
Just as I am, of that free love The breadth, length, depth and height to prove, Here for a season, then above, O Lamb of God, I come.
