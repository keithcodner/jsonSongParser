[Verse 1] 
Almighty God, faithful and true, In my worship I want to meet with You. Unchanging God, forever the same, It's You I worship, To know Your heart again.


[Verse 2] 
And I fall down on my knees again, As You show me what grace means; And You love with such amazing love, O my God, how can this be?
