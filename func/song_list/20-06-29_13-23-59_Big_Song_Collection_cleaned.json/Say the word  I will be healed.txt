[Verse 1] 
Say the word, I will be healed; You are the great Physician, You meet every need. Say the word, I will be free; Where chains have held me captive, Come sing Your songs to me, Say the word.


[Verse 2] 
Say the word, I will be filled; My hands reach out to heaven, Where striving is stilled. Say the word, I will be changed; Where I am dry and thirsty, Send cool, refreshing rain, Say the word.


[Verse 3] 
His tears have fallen like rain on my life; Each drop a fresh revelation. I will return to the place of the cross, Where grace and mercy Pour from heaven's throne.


[Verse 4] 
Say the word, I will be poor, That I might know the riches That You have in store. Say the word, I will be weak; Your strength will be the power That satisfies the meek. Say the word.


[Verse 5] 
The Lord will see the travail of His soul, And He and I will be satisfied. Complete the work You have started in me: O, come Lord Jesus, shake my life again.
