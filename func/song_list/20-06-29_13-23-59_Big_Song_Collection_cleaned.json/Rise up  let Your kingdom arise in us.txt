[Verse 1] 
Rise up, let Your kingdom arise in us; We lift our eyes to the skies, and rise up To the brightness of His rising. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
All creation awaits The revealing of the sons of God, And all the angels of heaven Are listening for the prayers of us: Hearing the sound of a powerful flood, Saints of our God who've been bought by His blood.


[Verse 3] 
Rise up, let Your kingdom arise in us; We lift our eyes to the skies, and rise up To the brightness of His rising. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
The redemption of God Has given us a kingdom view, And His promise to us, The hope of glory, Christ in you. Darkness shall run from the strength of His hand, Our testimony, the blood of the Lamb. 


[Verse 5] 
Rise up, let Your kingdom arise in us; We lift our eyes to the skies, and rise up To the brightness of His rising. (Repeat)
