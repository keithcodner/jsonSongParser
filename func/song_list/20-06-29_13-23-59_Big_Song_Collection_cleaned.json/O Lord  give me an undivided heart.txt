[Verse 1] 
O Lord, give me an undivided heart To follow You. O Lord, give me an undiminished love, To see what You see, to do what You do, O Lord, give me an undivided heart. O Lord, give me an unrelenting mind To seek Your face. 


[Verse 2] 
O Lord, give me an undefeated faith, To see victory in all that I do, To worship in spirit and truth. To see less of me, and much more of You, O Lord, give me an undivided heart. O Lord, give me an undivided heart.
