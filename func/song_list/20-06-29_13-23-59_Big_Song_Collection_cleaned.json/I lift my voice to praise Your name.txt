[Verse 1] 
I lift my voice to praise Your name, That through my life I might proclaim The praises of the One who reigns: Jesus, my Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Like a mighty flame that burns so bright, I am a bearer of His light. No longer I, for He is my life: Jesus, my Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, Jesus, alive in me. Jesus, Jesus, setting me free.
