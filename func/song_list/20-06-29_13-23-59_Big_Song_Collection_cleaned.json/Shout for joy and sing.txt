[Verse 1] 
Shout for joy and sing, Let your praises ring; See that God is building A kingdom for a King. His dwelling place with men, The new Jerusalem; Where Jesus is Lord over all.


[Verse 2] 
And we will worship, worship, We will worship Jesus the Lord. We will worship, worship, We will worship Jesus the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
A work so long concealed, In time will be revealed, As the sons of God shall rise and take their stand. Clothed in His righteousness, The church made manifest, Where Jesus is Lord over all.


[Verse 4] 
And we will worship, worship, We will worship Jesus the Lord. We will worship, worship, We will worship Jesus the Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Sovereign over all, Hail Him risen Lord. He alone is worthy of our praise. Reigning in majesty, Ruling in victory, Jesus is Lord over all. 


[Verse 6] 
And we will worship, worship, We will worship Jesus the Lord. We will worship, worship, We will worship Jesus the Lord.
