[Verse 1] 
You've kept watch over me since I was a child. You've stayed close when my heart has gone running wild. You've welcomed me back again and again. You've offered Your kindness, forgiven my sin.


[Verse 2] 
You're the source of all the good gifts I know; No one else can equal the love You show. Though my praise for You often comes so slow, How I long for my life with You to grow.


[Verse 3] 
In Your actions You show the proof of Your care. In Your presence comes comfort, You're ev'rywhere. In Your mercy I find hope that will last. In Your second life I am saved from my past.


[Verse 4] 
You're the source of all the good gifts I know; No one else can equal the love You show. Though my praise for You often comes so slow, How I long for my life with You to grow.
