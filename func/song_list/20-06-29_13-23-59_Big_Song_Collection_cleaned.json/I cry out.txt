[Verse 1] 
I cry out For your hand of mercy to heal me. I am weak, I need Your love to free me. O Lord, my Rock, My strength in weakness, Come rescue me, O Lord.


[Verse 2] 
You are my hope, Your promise never fails me. And my desire Is to follow You forever. ||For You are good, For You are good, For You are good to me. For You are good, For You are good, For You are good to me.
