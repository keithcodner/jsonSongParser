[Verse 1] 
I am a lighthouse, a shining and bright house, Out in the waves of a stormy sea. The oil of the Spirit keeps my lamp burning; Jesus, my Lord, is the light in me. ||And when people see the good things that I do, They'll give praises to God who has sent us Jesus. We'll send out a lifeboat of love and forgiveness And give them a hand to get in.


[Verse 2] 
I am a lighthouse, a shining and bright house, Out in the waves of a stormy sea. The oil of the Spirit keeps my lamp burning; Jesus, my Lord, is the light in me. ||And when people see the good things that I do, They'll give praises to God who has sent us Jesus. We'll send out a lifeboat of love and forgiveness And give them a hand to get in.


[Verse 3] 
While the storm is raging, whoosh, whoosh, And the wind is blowing, ooo, ooo, And the waves are crashing, Crash! crash! crash! crash! 


[Verse 4] 
I am a lighthouse, a shining and bright house, Out in the waves of a stormy sea. The oil of the Spirit keeps my lamp burning; Jesus, my Lord, is the light in me. ||And when people see the good things that I do, They'll give praises to God who has sent us Jesus. We'll send out a lifeboat of love and forgiveness And give them a hand to get in.
