[Verse 1] 
Love is patient, love is kind, It does not envy or speak in pride. It does not seek its own reward: Oh, that's how You love me, Lord.


[Verse 2] 
It always hopes and perseveres, It covers over a wealth of sins, It shuns all evil, delights in truth: Oh, I want to be like You.


[Verse 3] 
I'm in love with a King, I'm in love with a Friend, And whatever I do This love never ends. He's for me, He pleads for me, Pours out His life for me; What more do I need? Amazing love!


[Verse 4] 
There are tongues now, but they will cease; There is knowledge - it's incomplete. For what we know now, we know in part, But what endures is a loving heart.


[Verse 5] 
I'm in love with a King, I'm in love with a Friend, And whatever I do This love never ends. He's for me, He pleads for me, Pours out His life for me; What more do I need? Amazing love!
