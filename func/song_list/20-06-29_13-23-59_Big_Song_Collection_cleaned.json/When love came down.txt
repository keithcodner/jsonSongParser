[Verse 1] 
When love came down to earth And made His home with men, The hopeless found a hope, The sinner found a friend. Not to the powerful But to the poor He came, And humble, hungry hearts Were satisfied again.


[Verse 2] 
What joy, what peace has come to us! What hope, what help, what love!


[Verse 3] 
When every unclean thought, And every sinful deed Was scourged upon His back And hammered through His feet. The Innocent is cursed, The guilty are released; The punishment of God On God has brought me peace.


[Verse 4] 
What joy, what peace has come to us! What hope, what help, what love!


[Verse 5] 
Come lay your heavy load Down at the Master's feet; Your shame will be removed, Your joy will be complete. Come crucify your pride, And enter as a child; For those who bow down low He'll lift up to His side.


[Verse 6] 
What joy, what peace has come to us! What hope, what help, what love!
