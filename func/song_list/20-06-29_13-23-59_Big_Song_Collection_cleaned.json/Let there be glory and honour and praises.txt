[Verse 1] 
 (1st part) Let there be glory and honour and praises, Glory and honour to Jesus, Glory, honour, glory and honour to Him. (2nd part) Glory, glory and honour to Jesus, Glory, honour, glory and honour to Him.


[Verse 2] 
(1st and 2nd parts) Keep your light shining brightly As the darkness covers the earth; For a people that walk in darkness, They shall see, they shall see a great light.
