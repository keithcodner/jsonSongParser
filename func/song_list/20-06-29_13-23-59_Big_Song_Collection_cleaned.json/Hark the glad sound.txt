[Verse 1] 
Hark the glad sound! The Saviour comes, The Saviour promised long; Let every heart prepare a throne, And every voice a song.


[Verse 2] 
He comes the prisoners to release, In Satan's bondage held; The gates of brass before Him burst, The iron fetters yield.


[Verse 3] 
He comes the broken heart to bind, The bleeding soul to cure, And with the treasures of His grace To enrich the humble poor.


[Verse 4] 
Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace, Thy welcome shall proclaim; And heaven's eternal arches ring With Thy beloved name.
