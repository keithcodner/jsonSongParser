[Verse 1] 
Oh God, You are my God, And I will ever praise You. Oh God, You are my God, And I will ever praise You.|| I will seek You in the morning, And I will learn to walk in Your ways. And step by step, You'll lead me, And I will follow You all of my days.


[Verse 2] 
Oh God, You are my God, And I will ever praise You. Oh God, You are my God, And I will ever praise You.|| I will seek You in the morning, And I will learn to walk in Your ways. And step by step, You'll lead me, And I will follow You all of my days.


[Verse 3] 
And I will follow You all of my days. And I will follow You all of my days. And step by step, You'll lead me, And I will follow You all of my days.


[Verse 4] 
Sometimes the night was beautiful. Sometimes the sky was so far away. Sometimes it seemed to stoop So close you could touch it, But your heart would break.|| Sometimes the morning came too soon. Sometimes the day could be so hard. There was so much work left to do, But so much you'd already done.


[Verse 5] 
Sometimes I think of Abraham, How one star he saw had been lit for me. He was a stranger in this land, And I am that no less than he. And on this road to righteousness, Sometimes the climb can be so steep; I may falter in my steps, But never beyond Your reach.
