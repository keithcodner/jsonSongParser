[Verse 1] 
When a knight won His spurs In the stories of old, He was gentle and brave, He was gallant and bold; With a shield on his arm And a lance in his hand, For God and for valour He rode through the land.


[Verse 2] 
No charger have I, And no sword by my side, Yet still to adventure And battle I ride, Though back into storyland Giants have fled, And the knights are no more And the dragons are dead.


[Verse 3] 
Let faith be my shield And let joy be my steed 'Gainst the dragons of anger, The ogres of greed; And let me set free, With the sword of my youth, From the castle of darkness, The power of the truth.
