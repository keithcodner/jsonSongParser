[Verse 1] 
River of God, flood over me, And lift my feet up off the ground. Carry me out into Your sea, And in Your presence I'll be found.


[Verse 2] 
I've felt Your fire and I've felt Your rain; And I've heard Your voice whisper myname. I've been wading in Your river, I've ridden on Your waves; I've tasted of Your goodness, Still I'm longing to be changed.


[Verse 3] 
River of God, flood over me, And lift my feet up off the ground. Carry me out into Your sea, And in Your presence I'll be found.


[Verse 4] 
There's something inside me that just won't let go; Why am I afraid of losing control? Oh, I know Your love is for me, And You'll never do me harm; So melt away my fears, And Holy Spirit come!


[Verse 5] 
River of God, flood over me, And lift my feet up off the ground. Carry me out into Your sea, And in Your presence I'll be found.


[Verse 6] 
I've had enough of holding back, I see Your goodness all around, This time I'm opening up my heart, So come and fill me now.


[Verse 7] 
River of God, flood over me, And lift my feet up off the ground. Carry me out into Your sea, And in Your presence I'll be found.


[Verse 8] 
Please help me, Lord, to be more like You, To do all the things You've called me to do. Let me help bring in Your harvest, Oh, I want it for Your Son; So fill me with Your power, Holy Spirit come!


[Verse 9] 
River of God, flood over me, And lift my feet up off the ground. Carry me out into Your sea, And in Your presence I'll be found.


[Verse 10] 
Come like a mighty rushing wind, A tidal wave or a monsoon rain, Like a stream in the desert, Or a warm summer breeze; Gentle Dove of heaven, Bring me to my knees! 


[Verse 11] 
River of God, flood over me, And lift my feet up off the ground. Carry me out into Your sea, And in Your presence I'll be found.
