[Verse 1] 
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
For He alone is worthy, For He alone is worthy, For He alone is worthy, Christ the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
We'll give Him all the glory, We'll give Him all the glory, We'll give Him all the glory, Christ the Lord.
