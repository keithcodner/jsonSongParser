[Verse 1] 
What child is this, Who, laid to rest On Mary's lap is sleeping: Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, While shepherds watch are keeping? ||This, this is Christ the King, Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: Haste, haste, to bring Him praise, The babe, the Son of Mary.


[Verse 2] 
Why lies He in such mean estate, Where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christians, fear, for sinners here The silent Word is pleading. ||Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, The cross be borne for me, for you. Hail, hail the Word made flesh, The babe, the Son of Mary.


[Verse 3] 
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh, Come, peasant, king, to own Him; The King of kings salvation brings, Let loving hearts enthrone Him. ||Raise, raise a song on high, The virgin sings her lullaby. Joy, joy for Christ is born, The babe, the Son of Mary.
