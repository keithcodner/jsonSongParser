[Verse 1] 
Only You can replace Rags for riches pure as gold, And Your mercy saved my soul, There's none like You.


[Verse 2] 
At Your name demons flee, Mountains tremble in Your sight, But You love me like a friend, There's none like You.


[Verse 3] 
Nothing compares to You, You're the One we love. Send down Your holy fire Over all the earth. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
You have paid such a cost, So much more than can be won: God, You gave Your only Son, There's none like You.


[Verse 5] 
Nothing compares to You, You're the One we love. Send down Your holy fire Over all the earth. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
So we'll bow to the cross Where the tears of heaven fall. You have heard the sinner's call: There's none like You.


[Verse 7] 
Nothing compares to You, You're the One we love. Send down Your holy fire Over all the earth. (Repeat)
