[Verse 1] 
I look beyond the empty cross, Forgetting what my life has cost. I wipe away the crimson stains And all the nails that still remain.|| More and more I need you now. I owe you more each passing hour. The battle between grace and pride I gave up not so long ago.|| So steal my heart and take the pain And wash the feet and cleanse my pride. Take the selfish, take the weak, And all the things I cannot hide.|| Take the beauty, take my tears, My sinful soil'd heart, make it pure. Take my world, it all is yours, Take it now, take it now.


[Verse 2] 
(To love you) | To serve the ones that I despise, Take my world apart | Speak the words I can't deny, (To need you) | And watch the world I used to know I am on my knees | Fall to dust and blow away.|| (To love you) | I look beyond the empty cross, Take my world apart | Forgetting what my life has cost. (To need you) | So wipe away the crimson stains Broken on my knees | And all the nails that still remain.|| (To need you) | And steal my heart and take the pain, And take the selfish, take the weak, (To need you) | And all the things I cannot hide. Take the beauty, take my tears,|| On my knees (To need you) | Take my world apart. Take my world apart. (To need you) | And I do pray, And I pray, and I pray, On my knees Take my world apart.


[Verse 3] 
My worlds apart.
