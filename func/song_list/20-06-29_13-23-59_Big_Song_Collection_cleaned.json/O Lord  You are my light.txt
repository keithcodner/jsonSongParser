[Verse 1] 
O Lord, You are my light, O Lord, You are my salvation. You have delivered me from all my fear, For You are the defence of my life.


[Verse 2] 
For my life is hidden with Christ in God, You have concealed me in Your love, You've lifted me up, placed my feet on a rock; I will shout for joy in the house of God.
