[Verse 1] 
Oh, the mercy of God, the glory of grace, That You chose to redeem us, to forgive and restore, And You call us Your children, chosen in Him To be holy and blameless to the glory of God.


[Verse 2] 
To the praise of His glorious grace, To the praise of His glory and power; To Him be all glory, honour and praise Forever and ever and ever, amen.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, the richness of grace, the depths of His love, In Him is redemption, the forgiveness of sin. You called us as righteous, predestined in Him For the praise of His glory, included in Christ.


[Verse 4] 
To the praise of His glorious grace, To the praise of His glory and power; To Him be all glory, honour and praise Forever and ever and ever, amen.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, the glory of God expressed in His Son, His image and likeness revealed to us all; The plea of the ages completed in Christ, That we be presented perfected in Him. 


[Verse 6] 
To the praise of His glorious grace, To the praise of His glory and power; To Him be all glory, honour and praise Forever and ever and ever, amen.
