[Verse 1] 
Holy, Holy, God Almighty, Who was and is to come. God of glory, You're so worthy, All the saints bow down.

Holy is Your name in all the earth. Righteous are Your ways, so merciful. Everything You've done is just and true. Holy, holy God are You. Holy, holy God are You.

All blessing, all honour belongs to You. All power, all wisdom is Yours.


[Verse 4] 
Holy is Your name in all the earth. Righteous are Your ways, so merciful. Everything You've done is just and true. Holy, holy God are You. Holy, holy God are You.
