[Verse 1] 
In heavenly armour We'll enter the land, The battle belongs to the Lord. No weapon that's fashioned Against us will stand, The battle belongs to the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
And we sing glory, honour, Power and strength to the Lord. We sing glory, honour, Power and strength to the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
When the power of darkness Comes in like a flood, The battle belongs to the Lord. He's raised up a standard, The power of His blood, The battle belongs to the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
And we sing glory, honour, Power and strength to the Lord. We sing glory, honour, Power and strength to the Lord.


[Verse 5] 
When your enemy presses in hard, Do not fear, The battle belongs to the Lord. Take courage, my friend, Your redemption is near. The battle belongs to the Lord. 


[Verse 6] 
And we sing glory, honour, Power and strength to the Lord. We sing glory, honour, Power and strength to the Lord.
