[Verse 1] 
[E]I stand to [B4]praise You, but I [A2]fall on my [B4]knees. [E]My spirit is [B4]willing, but my [A2]flesh is so [B4]weak.


[Verse 2] 
So, light the [A2]fire (echo) In my [B4]soul. (echo) Fan the [A2]flame, (echo) Make me [B4]whole. (make my spirit whole) Lord, You [A2]know (echo) Where I [B4]am, (where I've been) So light the [A2]fire in my [B4]heart [E]again.


[Verse 3] 
I [E]feel Your arms [B4]around me, as the [A2]power of your healing begi[B4]ns. Your [E]spirit moves right [B4]through me like a [A2]mighty rushing [B4]wind.


[Verse 4] 
So, light the [A2]fire (echo) In my [B4]soul. (echo) Fan the [A2]flame, (echo) Make me [B4]whole. (make my spirit whole) Lord, You [A2]know (echo) Where I [B4]am, (where I've been) So light the [A2]fire in my [B4]heart [E]again.


[Verse 5] 
So, light the [A2]fire (echo) In my [B4]soul. (echo) Fan the [A2]flame, (echo) Make me [B4]whole. (make my spirit whole) Lord, You [A2]know (echo) Where I [B4]am, (where I've been) So light the [A2]fire in my [B4]heart [E]again.


[Verse 6] 
So light the [A2]fire in my [B4]heart [E]again.
