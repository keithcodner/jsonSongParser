[Verse 1] 
How can I repay You, Lord, For all You've done for me? Nothing I can say or do Will ever be enough.


[Verse 2] 
I will live for You, Walking in Your way, Lifting high Your name, Holding close the cross. Not in words alone, But in what I do, I will live my life for You.


[Verse 3] 
Dear Lord, Your heart is drawing me, A calling from Your throne. And in my brokenness I come And whisper to You, Lord.


[Verse 4] 
I will live for You, Walking in Your way, Lifting high Your name, Holding close the cross. Not in words alone, But in what I do, I will live my life for You.


[Verse 5] 
It's not by works, but by Your grace, I'll never earn Your love. You loved me first, You'll love me last, Your cross, my only hope.


[Verse 6] 
I will live for You, Walking in Your way, Lifting high Your name, Holding close the cross. Not in words alone, But in what I do, I will live my life for You.
