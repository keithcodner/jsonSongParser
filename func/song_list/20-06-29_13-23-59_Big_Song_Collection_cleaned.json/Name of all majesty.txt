[Verse 1] 
Name of all majesty, Fathomless mystery, King of the ages By angels adored; Power and authority, Splendour and dignity, Bow to His mastery - Jesus is Lord!


[Verse 2] 
Child of our destiny, God from eternity, Love of the Father On sinners outpoured; See now what God has done, Sending His only Son, Christ the beloved One - Jesus is Lord!


[Verse 3] 
Saviour of Calvary, Costliest victory, Darkness defeated And Eden restored; Born as a man to die, Nailed to a cross on high, Cold in the grave to lie - Jesus is Lord!


[Verse 4] 
Source of all sovereignty, Light, immortality, Life everlasting And heaven assured; So with the ransomed, we Praise Him eternally, Christ in His majesty - Jesus is Lord!
