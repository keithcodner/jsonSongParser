[Verse 1] 
I was made to praise You, I was made to glorify Your name, In every circumstance To find a chance to thank You. I was made to love You I was made to worship at Your feet, And to obey You, Lord. I was made for You.


[Verse 2] 
I will always praise You, I will always glorify Your name. In every circumstance I'll find a chance to thank You. I will always love You, I will always worship at Your feet, And I'll obey You, Lord. I was made for You.
