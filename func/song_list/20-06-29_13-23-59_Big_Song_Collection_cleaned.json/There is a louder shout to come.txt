[Verse 1] 
There is a louder shout to come, There is a sweeter song to hear; All the nations with one voice, All the people with one fear. ||Bowing down before Your throne, Every tribe and tongue will be; All the nations with one voice, All the people with one King. And what a song we'll sing upon that day.


[Verse 2] 
O what a song we'll sing and O what a tune we'll bear; You deserve an anthem of the highest praise. O what a joy will rise and O what a sound we'll make; You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.


[Verse 3] 
Now we see a part of this, One day we shall see in full; All the nations with one voice, All the people with one love. ||No one else will share Your praise, Nothing else can take Your place; All the nations with one voice, All the people with one Lord. And what a song we'll sing upon that day.


[Verse 4] 
O what a song we'll sing and O what a tune we'll bear; You deserve an anthem of the highest praise. O what a joy will rise and O what a sound we'll make; You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.


[Verse 5] 
Even now upon the earth There's a glimpse of all to come; Many people with one voice, Harmony of many tongues. ||We will all confess Your name, You will be our only praise; All the nations with one voice, All the people with one God. And what a song we'll sing upon that day. 


[Verse 6] 
O what a song we'll sing and O what a tune we'll bear; You deserve an anthem of the highest praise. O what a joy will rise and O what a sound we'll make; You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.
