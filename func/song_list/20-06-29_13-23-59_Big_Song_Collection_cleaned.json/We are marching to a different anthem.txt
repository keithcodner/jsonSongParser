[Verse 1] 
We are marching to a different anthem, We are dancing to a different song; And our hearts have come alive with freedom, Mercy has come, the God of mercy has come. ||He is moving through the towns and cities, He is binding up the broken ones; And His healing hand is working wonders, See how they come, He sets them free when they come. And I sing:


[Verse 2] 
I love the God of heaven, I love His precious Son; And in the Holy Spirit, He's making us strong, And giving us the victory. ||I love the God of heaven, I love His precious Son; And in the Holy Spirit, He's making us strong, And giving us a victory song.


[Verse 3] 
He is training up our hands for battle, And equipping us to take the land; For the promises to us are mighty, We will be strong, and move together as one. ||We are heading for our finest hour, When our Saviour will be magnified, And His glory will outshine all others: Jesus is Lord, let Him be praised and adored. And I sing: 


[Verse 4] 
I love the God of heaven, I love His precious Son; And in the Holy Spirit, He's making us strong, And giving us the victory. ||I love the God of heaven, I love His precious Son; And in the Holy Spirit, He's making us strong, And giving us a victory song.
