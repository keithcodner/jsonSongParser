[Verse 1] 
The people who walk in darkness Will see a great light, For those who live in the land Of the shadow of death, The light will shine.


[Verse 2] 
You will enlarge the nation, And increase their joy, So they delight in Your presence As they will rejoice At harvest time.


[Verse 3] 
For to us a Child is born, To us a Son is given, And the government Will be upon His shoulders. Of His government and peace There will always be increase; There is no end to His kingdom.


[Verse 4] 
He will be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Repeat) The Prince of Peace.


[Verse 5] 
For to us a Child is born, To us a Son is given, And the government Will be upon Your shoulders. Come to break our yoke of grief, The bar across our shoulders; Lord, smash the rod of our oppressors.


[Verse 6] 
You will be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Repeat) The Prince of Peace.
