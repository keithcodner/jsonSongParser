[Verse 1] 
I'm grateful for the way You look at me. I'm thankful that You don't give up. You're a friend who's smiled at me a thousand times. When I cause You pain, You bring me love.


[Verse 2] 
I've found a place where I'm free. I'm dancing now, 'cause You love me. (You love me, You love me, You love me.)


[Verse 3] 
I love You, You know it's true. And all I want is to be close to You.


[Verse 4] 
I've found a place where I'm free. I'm dancing now, 'cause You love me. (You love me, You love me, You love me.)


[Verse 5] 
I love You, You know it's true. And all I want is to be close to You.


[Verse 6] 
When I've done the worst, You've seen the best in me. I was running away, But You brought some rest to me. My heart is Yours and I give it all to You. And when it's tough, I know You'll Pull me through.
