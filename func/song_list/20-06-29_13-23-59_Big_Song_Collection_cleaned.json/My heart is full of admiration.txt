[Verse 1] 
My heart is full of admiration For You, my Lord, my God and King. Your excellence my inspiration, Your words of grace have made my spirit sing.


[Verse 2] 
All the glory, honour and power Belong to You, belong to You. Jesus, Saviour, Anointed One, I worship You, I worship You.


[Verse 3] 
You love what's right and hate what's evil, Therefore Your God sets You on high, And on Your head pours oil of gladness, While fragrance fills Your royal palaces.


[Verse 4] 
All the glory, honour and power Belong to You, belong to You. Jesus, Saviour, Anointed One, I worship You, I worship You.


[Verse 5] 
Your throne, O God, will last forever, Justice will be Your royal decree. In majesty, ride out victorious, For righteousness, truth and humility. 


[Verse 6] 
All the glory, honour and power Belong to You, belong to You. Jesus, Saviour, Anointed One, I worship You, I worship You.
