[Verse 1] 
Make us one, Lord, make us one, Lord, By Your Spirit, make us one, Lord. We are members of one body, Make us one, Lord, we pray.


[Verse 2] 
Every tribe and nation Is represented here, Watching with each other As the day of Christ draws near; Worshipping the Saviour Who died to set us free, We belong together; We are family.
