[Verse 1] 
It is no longer I that liveth But Christ that liveth in me, It is no longer I that liveth But Christ that liveth in me. He lives, He lives, Jesus is alive in me. It is no longer I that liveth But Christ that liveth in me.


[Verse 2] 
The life that I live in the body I live by faith in the Son. The life that I live in the body I live by faith in the Son. He loves, He loves, Jesus gave Himself for me. The life that I live in the body I live by faith in the Son.
