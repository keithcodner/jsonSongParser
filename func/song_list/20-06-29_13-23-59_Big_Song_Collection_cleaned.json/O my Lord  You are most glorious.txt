[Verse 1] 
O my Lord, You are most glorious, King of kings and Prince of Peace. By Your word this world was created; By Your love I have been set free. ||And I lift my hands in worship up to Your throne, I will declare how much You mean to me. You are my Lord, it's You I worship; Son of God, You reign in majesty.
