[Verse 1] 
Soldiers of our God, arise! The day is drawing nearer; Shake the slumber from your eyes, The light is growing clearer. Sit no longer idly by While the heedless millions die. O, lift the blood-stained banner high, And take the field for Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
Save the lost! Save the lost! Spend your might for them; Give your life for them. Save the lost! Save the lost! Don't back down on it; Win your crown in it, Soldiers of our God, Soldiers of our God.


[Verse 3] 
See the brazen hosts of hell Their art and power employing, More than human tongue can tell The blood-bought souls destroying. See on ruin's hell-bound road Victims groan beneath their load; Go forward, O you sons of God, And dare or die for Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
Save the lost! Save the lost! Spend your might for them; Give your life for them. Save the lost! Save the lost! Don't back down on it; Win your crown in it, Soldiers of our God, Soldiers of our God.


[Verse 5] 
Warriors of the risen King, Great army of salvation, Spread His fame, His praises sing And conquer every nation. Raise the glorious standard higher, Work for victory, never tire; O, forward march with blood and fire, And win the world for Jesus.


[Verse 6] 
Save the lost! Save the lost! Spend your might for them; Give your life for them. Save the lost! Save the lost! Don't back down on it; Win your crown in it, Soldiers of our God, Soldiers of our God.
