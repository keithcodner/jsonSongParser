[Verse 1] 
Laying aside everything That would hinder us from coming Into the presence of our Great and awesome King; Lifting up holy hands in faith, We long to see You face to face, Freely we come, freely we come. 


[Verse 2] 
And we're looking to Jesus, The One who has saved us. We're looking to Jesus, The One who can heal us. To the Author and the Finisher Of all that we believe, Freely we come, Freely we come.
