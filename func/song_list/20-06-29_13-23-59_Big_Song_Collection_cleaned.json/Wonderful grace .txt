[Verse 1] 
Wonderful grace, That gives what I don't deserve, Pays me what Christ has earned, Then lets me go free. Wonderful grace, That gives me the time to change, Washes away the stains That once covered me. 


[Verse 2] 
And all that I have I lay at the feet Of the wonderful Saviour Who loves me.


[Verse 3] 
Wonderful love, That held in the face of death, Breathed in its latest breath Forgiveness for me. Wonderful love, Whose power can break every chain, Giving us life again, Setting us free.


[Verse 4] 
And all that I have I lay at the feet Of the wonderful Saviour Who loves me.
