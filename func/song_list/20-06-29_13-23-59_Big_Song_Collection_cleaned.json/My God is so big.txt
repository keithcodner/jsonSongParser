[Verse 1] 
My God is so big, So strong and so mighty, There's nothing that He cannot do. My God is so big, So strong and so mighty, There's nothing that He cannot do. || The rivers are His, The mountains are His, The stars are His handiwork too. My God is so big, So strong and so mighty, There's nothing that He cannot do.


[Verse 2] 
My God is so big, So strong and so mighty, There's nothing that He cannot do. My God is so big, So strong and so mighty, There's nothing that He cannot do. || He's called you to live For Him every day, In all that you say and you do. My God is so big, So strong and so mighty, There's nothing that He cannot do.
