[Verse 1] 
All of me, All of me I give to You, Only You, Jesus. More of You, More of You I long for, Only You, Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
For this life I live for You; I truly worship You. All of my days, in every way, I will praise You. In thought and word and deed, Powered by Your life in me, All of my days, in every way, I will praise You, Lord.
