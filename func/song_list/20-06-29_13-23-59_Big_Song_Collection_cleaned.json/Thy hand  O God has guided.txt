[Verse 1] 
Thy hand, O God has guided Thy flock, from age to age; The wondrous tale is written, Full clear on every page. Our fathers owned Thy goodness, And we their deeds record; And both of this bear witness: One Church, one Faith, one Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Thy heralds brought glad tidings To greatest as to least; They bade them rise and hasten To share the great King's feast. And this was all their teaching In every deed and word; To all alike proclaiming: One Church, one Faith, one Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Through many a day of darkness, Through many a scene of strife, The faithful few fought bravely To guard the nation's life. Their gospel of redemption, Sin pardoned, man restored, Was all in this enfolded: One Church, one Faith, one Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Thy mercy will not fail us, Nor leave Thy work undone; With Thy right hand to help us, The victory shall be won. And then, by men and angels, Thy name shall be adored, And this shall be their anthem: One Church, one Faith, one Lord.
