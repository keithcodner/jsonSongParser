[Verse 1] 
Lord, come and heal Your church, Take our lives and cleanse with Your fire. Let Your deliverance flow, As we lift Your name up higher.


[Verse 2] 
We will draw near, And surrender our fear; Lift our hands to proclaim Holy Father, You are here.


[Verse 3] 
Spirit of God, come in And release our hearts to praise You. Make us whole, for Holy we'll become, and serve You.


[Verse 4] 
We will draw near, And surrender our fear; Lift our hands to proclaim Holy Father, You are here.


[Verse 5] 
Show us Your power, we pray, That we might share in Your glory. We shall arise and go To proclaim Your works most holy. 


[Verse 6] 
We will draw near, And surrender our fear; Lift our hands to proclaim Holy Father, You are here.
