[Verse 1] 
Hear my mouth speak, see my mind think, Know my spirit tries to pray. Lord, we're longing to see You moving, Help us as we pray today. ||Words don't seem enough to tell You our desire, To see Your kingdom come and Your light shine.


[Verse 2] 
Light of the world, would You shine on me? Light of the world, would You shine on me?


[Verse 3] 
Now I trust You, and I ask You, Let Your will be done in me. May Your light shine in all the earth and Let it draw us all to You. ||Now Your glory shines throughout Your holy church, 'Cause You're our only hope, Saviour of the world.


[Verse 4] 
Light of the world, would You shine on me? Light of the world, would You shine on me?


[Verse 5] 
Shine on me so I reflect Your glory, Live in me so people see Your beauty, Pour on me, so out of me flow streams of living water. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
Light of the world, would You shine on me? Light of the world, would You shine on me?
