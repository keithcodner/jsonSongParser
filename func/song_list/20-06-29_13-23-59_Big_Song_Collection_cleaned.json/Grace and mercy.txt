[Verse 1] 
Grace and mercy wash over me, Cleanse my soul with Your healing stream. Here I stand with this prayer within my heart. Take me deeper in the river that flows with Your love.


[Verse 2] 
Thank You, thank You, Oh what riches are mine in Christ Jesus. Thank You, thank You, Your forgiveness is so undeserved.
