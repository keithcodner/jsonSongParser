[Verse 1] 
Love like a jewel has come down, Most precious gem In heaven's crown. Love like a jewel has come down, The greatest treasure That I have found.


[Verse 2] 
And I will seek after You, Forsake everything that is distracting me From this searching, And run to the place Where my heart only hears the beat Of Your love for this world.


[Verse 3] 
Love like a jewel has come down, You walk with the hurting, You're a friend to the poor. Love like a jewel has come down, Our greatest treasure, Where hope can be found.


[Verse 4] 
And I will seek after You, Forsake everything that is distracting me From this searching, And run to the place Where my heart only hears the beat Of Your love for this world.
