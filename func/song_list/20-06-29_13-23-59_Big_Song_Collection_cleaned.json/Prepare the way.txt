[Verse 1] 
Prepare the way of the Lord, Prepare the way of the Lord. Prepare the way of the Lord, Prepare the way of the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Majestic in holiness, Awesome in glory, Doing wonders, this is our God. We will not be silenced From speaking His word. We cry to the nations:


[Verse 3] 
All authority is invested In the name of Jesus, And at the sounding of that name, At the sounding of that name He will arise.
