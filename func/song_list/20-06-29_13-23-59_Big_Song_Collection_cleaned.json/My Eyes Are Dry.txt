[Verse 1] 
My [A]eyes are [E]dry, my [D]faith is [A]old, My [Bm]heart is [F#m]hard, my [E]prayers are cold; And [A]I know [E]how I [D]ought to [A]be: A[Bm]live to [F#m]You and [E]dead to [A]me.


[Verse 2] 
[A]Oh, what can be [D]done for an [D]old [C#m]heart [Bm]like [A]mine? Soften it [E]up with oil and [A]wine; The oil is [D]You, Your Spi[C#m]rit [Bm]of [A]love, Please wash me a[E]new In the [D]wine of Your [A]blood.
