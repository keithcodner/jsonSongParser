[Verse 1] 
May our worship be as fragrance, May our worship be as incense poured forth, May our worship be acceptable As a living sacrifice, As a living sacrifice.


[Verse 2] 
We are willing to pay the price, We are willing to lay down our lives As an offering of obedience, As a living sacrifice, As a living sacrifice.
