[Verse 1] 
Lord, I come, longing to know You, Lord, I come, drawn by Your love; Lord, I come, longing to see Your face, For You called me to come Into the holiest place.


[Verse 2] 
What did I do to deserve Your favour? What did I do to deserve Your grace? Called by my name into Your presence, Undeserved, holy God.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, I come, because of Jesus, Lord, I come, because He came; Lord, I bow, as You reveal Your face, You have called me to come Into the holiest place.


[Verse 4] 
What did I do to deserve Your favour? What did I do to deserve Your grace? Called by my name into Your presence, Undeserved, holy God.
