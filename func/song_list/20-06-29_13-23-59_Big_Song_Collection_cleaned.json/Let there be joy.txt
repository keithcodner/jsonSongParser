[Verse 1] 
Let there be joy, let there be peace, Let there be power, let there be praise. Let there be joy, joy in the Holy Ghost. ||It was for freedom that we were set free, Let every mountain be cast to the sea. Let there be joy, joy in the Holy Ghost.


[Verse 2] 
We will declare it to the heavens, The righteousness of God in which we stand. We will proclaim it to the nations; Every eye shall see, every ear shall hear, Every heart will understand.
