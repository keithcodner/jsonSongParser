[Verse 1] 
Mighty, mighty Lord. Precious is Your name. Wonderful Your ways, Worthy of all praise, Jehovah.

Mighty, mighty Lord. Holy is Your name. Glorious and true, Great in all You do, Jehovah, Jehovah.

Hallowed be Your name, Lord God Almighty, For Yours is the kingdom, The power and the glory, Forever more.
