[Verse 1] 
Wonderful love coming to me, Wonderful grace, freedom and mercy; Bought with a price, death on a cross, Wonderful love, Jesus, You've given to me.


[Verse 2] 
You are Christ, Son of God, Suffering Lamb, pouring out Your life; You've conquered death, And You're reigning supreme in my life.
