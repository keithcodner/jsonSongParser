[Verse 1] 
Holy one, righteous King, Merciful You are: Merciful I'll be. Broken One, bruised for me, In Your death, O Lord, You have set me free.


[Verse 2] 
Because Your Father loved me so, You came to me, Lord Jesus, So that I would know Love unconditional and life eternal, O my Lord, my God, my all.


[Verse 3] 
Risen One, Majesty, Restoration, come Breathe new life in me. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
Because Your Father loved me so, You came to me, Lord Jesus, So that I would know Love unconditional and life eternal, O my Lord, my God, my all.
