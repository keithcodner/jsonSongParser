[Verse 1] 
Holy, Holy are You, Lord, The whole earth is filled with Your glory. Let the nations rise to give Honour and praise to Your name. Let Your face shine on us And the world will know You live.


[Verse 2] 
All the heavens shout Your praise, Beautiful is our God, The universe will sing Hallelujah to You, our King.
