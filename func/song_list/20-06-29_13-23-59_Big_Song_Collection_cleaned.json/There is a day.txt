[Verse 1] 
There is a day That all creation's waiting for, A day of freedom and liberation for the earth. And on that day The Lord will come to meet His bride, And when we see Him In an instant we'll be changed.


[Verse 2] 
The trumpet sounds And the dead will then be raised By His power, Never to perish again. Once only flesh, Now clothed with immortality; Death has now been Swallowed up in victory.


[Verse 3] 
We will meet Him in the air And then we will be like Him, For we will see Him, as He is, Oh yeah! Then all hurt and pain will cease, And we'll be with Him forever, And in His glory we will live, Oh yeah, oh yeah!


[Verse 4] 
So lift your eyes To the things as yet unseen, That will remain now For all eternity. Though trouble's hard It's only momentary, And it's achieving Our future glory.


[Verse 5] 
We will meet Him in the air And then we will be like Him, For we will see Him, as He is, Oh yeah! Then all hurt and pain will cease, And we'll be with Him forever, And in His glory we will live, Oh yeah, oh yeah!
