[Verse 1] 
Man of sorrows! what a name For the Son of God, who came Ruined sinners to reclaim! Hallelujah! what a Saviour!


[Verse 2] 
Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood; Sealed my pardon with His blood: Hallelujah! what a Saviour!


[Verse 3] 
Guilty, vile, and helpless, we; Spotless Lamb of God was He: Full atonement - can it be? Hallelujah! what a Saviour!


[Verse 4] 
Lifted up was He to die, 'It is finished!' was His cry: Now in heaven exalted high: Hallelujah! what a Saviour!


[Verse 5] 
When He comes, our glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring, Then anew this song we'll sing: 'Hallelujah! what a Saviour!'
