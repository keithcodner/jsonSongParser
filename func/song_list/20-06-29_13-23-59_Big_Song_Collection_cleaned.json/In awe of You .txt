[Verse 1] 
In awe of You, we worship And stand amazed at Your great love. We're changed from glory to glory, We set our hearts on You, our God.


[Verse 2] 
Now Your presence fills this place, Be exalted in our praise. As we worship I believe You are near. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Blessing and honour And glory and power Forever, forever. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
Now Your presence fills this place, Be exalted in our praise. As we worship I believe You are near. (Repeat)
