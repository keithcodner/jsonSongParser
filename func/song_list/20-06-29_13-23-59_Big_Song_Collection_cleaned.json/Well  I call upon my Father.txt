[Verse 1] 
Well, I call upon my Father In the name of Christ Your Son, Let the streams of Your forgiveness Come upon me as a flood.


[Verse 2] 
I give my love to my Creator, Reveal my heart unto my God. I bring my life before the Healer, For I know in You my shame Will be thrown down.


[Verse 3] 
For with sin there's separation, Yet by grace through faith I'm saved; Can You hear my spirit crying, 'Come and wash my sin away'?


[Verse 4] 
I give my love to my Creator, Reveal my heart unto my God. I bring my life before the Healer, For I know in You my shame Will be thrown down.


[Verse 5] 
You're washing me down, You're washing me down. You're washing me down, You're washing me down. 


[Verse 6] 
I give my love to my Creator, Reveal my heart unto my God. I bring my life before the Healer, For I know in You my shame Will be thrown down.


[Verse 7] 
Well I call upon my Father In the name of Christ Your Son, Now I've tasted Your forgiveness, My redemption through Your blood.


[Verse 8] 
I give my love to my Creator, Reveal my heart unto my God. I bring my life before the Healer, For I know in You my shame Will be thrown down.
