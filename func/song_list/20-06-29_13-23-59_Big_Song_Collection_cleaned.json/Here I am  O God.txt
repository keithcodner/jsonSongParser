[Verse 1] 
Here I am, O God, I bring this sacrifice, My open heart, I offer up my life. I look to You, Lord, Your love that never ends Restores me again.


[Verse 2] 
So I lift my eyes to You, Lord, In Your strength I will break through, Lord. Touch me now, let Your love fall down on me. ||I know Your love dispels all my fears. Through the storm I will hold on, Lord, And by faith I will walk on, Lord, Then I'll see beyond my Calvary one day, And I will be complete in You.
