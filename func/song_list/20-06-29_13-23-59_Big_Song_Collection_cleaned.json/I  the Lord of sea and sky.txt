[Verse 1] 
I, the Lord of sea and sky, I have heard My people cry; All who dwell in dark and sin My hand will save. I, who made the stars of night, I will make their darkness bright. Who will bear My light to them? Whom shall I send?


[Verse 2] 
Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord? I have heard You calling in the night. I will go, Lord, If You lead me; I will hold Your people in my heart.


[Verse 3] 
I, the Lord of snow and rain, I have borne my people's pain; I have wept for love of them - They turn away. I will break their hearts of stone, Give them hearts for love alone; I will speak My word to them. Whom shall I send?


[Verse 4] 
Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord? I have heard You calling in the night. I will go, Lord, If You lead me; I will hold Your people in my heart.


[Verse 5] 
I, the Lord of wind and flame, I will tend the poor and lame, I will set a feast for them - My hand will save. Finest bread I will provide Till their hearts are satisfied; I will give My life to them. Whom shall I send? 


[Verse 6] 
Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord? I have heard You calling in the night. I will go, Lord, If You lead me; I will hold Your people in my heart.
