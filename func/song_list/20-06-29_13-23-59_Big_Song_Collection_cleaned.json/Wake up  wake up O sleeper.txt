[Verse 1] 
Wake up, wake up O sleeper, And rise from the dead. Wake up, wake up O sleeper, And rise from the dead.


[Verse 2] 
We are His people drawn by grace, Chosen by His glorious name, Called to give Him all our praise, Set apart to worship Him. ||We must be humble now and pray, And turn from all our careless ways, And in our hearts wait for the hour For Christ to come in awesome power.


[Verse 3] 
Wake up, wake up O sleeper, And rise from the dead. Wake up, wake up O sleeper, And rise from the dead.


[Verse 4] 
We are called to righteousness, To be like God in holiness; So let all slander now subside, And flee from bitterness and rage. ||And soon the night will fade away, And in its place will come the day; So we must clothe ourselves in light, The armour that will help us fight. Revere the name of the Lord, And He will shine on you; He will arise with healing And set you free. 


[Verse 5] 
Wake up, wake up O sleeper, And rise from the dead. Wake up, wake up O sleeper, And rise from the dead.
