[Verse 1] 
River, wash over me, Cleanse me and make me new. Bathe me, refresh me and fill me anew, River wash over me.


[Verse 2] 
Spirit, watch over me, Lead me to Jesus' feet. Cause me to worship and fill me anew, Spirit, watch over me.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus, rule over me, Reign over all my heart. Teach me to praise You and fill me anew, Jesus, rule over me.
