[Verse 1] 
Your light broke through my night, Restored exceeding joy. Your grace fell like the rain, And made this desert live.


[Verse 2] 
You have turned My mourning into dancing. You have turned My sorrow into joy.


[Verse 3] 
Your hand lifted me up, I stand on higher ground. Your praise rose in my heart, And made this valley sing.


[Verse 4] 
You have turned My mourning into dancing. You have turned My sorrow into joy.


[Verse 5] 
This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome. This is how we overcome.


[Verse 6] 
Your hand lifted me up, I stand on higher ground. Your praise rose in my heart, And made this valley sing.


[Verse 7] 
You turned My mourning into dancing. You have turned My sorrow into joy.
