[Verse 1] 
Is anyone thirsty, anyone? Is anyone thirsty? Is anyone thirsty, anyone? Is anyone thirsty? Jesus said 'Let them come to me and drink, Let them come to me.'


[Verse 2] 
O, let the living waters flow, O, let the living waters flow, Let the river of Your Spirit Flow through me. (Repeat) Flow through me.


[Verse 3] 
Let the living waters flow. Let the living waters flow. Let the living waters flow. Let the living waters flow. 


[Verse 4] 
O, let the living waters flow, O, let the living waters flow, Let the river of Your Spirit Flow through me. (Repeat) Flow through me.
