[Verse 1] 
My hope is in the Lord Who has renewed my strength, When everything seems senseless, My hope is still in Him Who has made heaven and earth And things seen and unseen; Whatever shade of passing day, My hope is still in Him.


[Verse 2] 
My hope is in You, Lord. My hope is in You, Lord. My hope is in You, Lord. My hope is in You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
For I know that my eyes shall see You, In the latter days to come. When You stand on the earth, With my lips, I will confess That the hope of my heart is come, That the hope of my heart is come.


[Verse 4] 
My hope is in You, Lord. My hope is in You, Lord. My hope is in You, Lord. My hope is in You, Lord.
