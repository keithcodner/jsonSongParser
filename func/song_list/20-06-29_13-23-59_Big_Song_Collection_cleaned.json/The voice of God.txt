[Verse 1] 
The voice of God is calling With words that roar and rage; The passion of the Father's heart Resounds through every age. Multitudes are waiting For this gospel we proclaim; Christ Jesus came among us That all men might be saved.


[Verse 2] 
Show Your glory, show Your glory, Show Your glory over all the earth. Show Your glory, show Your glory, Show Your glory over all the earth.


[Verse 3] 
This is our commission, To fill the air with praise And to tell the people of this world The glory of His name. With thousands upon thousands From every tribe and tongue We cry, 'Worthy is the Lamb once slain, For He has overcome!'


[Verse 4] 
Show Your glory, show Your glory, Show Your glory over all the earth. Show Your glory, show Your glory, Show Your glory over all the earth.


[Verse 5] 
With tears of intercession, Through the prayers of all the saints, We long to reach the nations With humility and grace. Come touch this generation And use us, Lord, we pray; Fill our hearts with boldness To do the things You say.


[Verse 6] 
Show Your glory, show Your glory, Show Your glory over all the earth. Show Your glory, show Your glory, Show Your glory over all the earth.
