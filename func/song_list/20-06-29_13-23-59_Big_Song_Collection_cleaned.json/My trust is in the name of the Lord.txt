[Verse 1] 
My trust is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth; My trust is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth.

Sing hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah.


[Verse 3] 
My hope is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth; My hope is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth;


[Verse 4] 
Sing hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah.


[Verse 5] 
My joy is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth; My joy is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth; 


[Verse 6] 
Sing hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah.
