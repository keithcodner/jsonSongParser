[Verse 1] 
[A]The [D]first no[A]well, the [G]an[D/F#]gel [Em7]did [D]say, Was to [G]cer[D/F#]tain [Em7]poor [D]shepherds in [Em]fields as [A]they [D]lay, [A]In [D]fields where they [A]lay, a [G]ke[D/F#]eping [Em7]their [D]sheep, On a [G]cold [D/F#]winte[Em7]r's [D]night that [Em]was [A]so [D]deep.


[Verse 2] 
[A]No[D]well, no[A]well, no[G]well, no[D/F#]well, [G]Born[D/F#] is [Em7]the [D]King of [Em]Isr[A]ae[D]l.


[Verse 3] 
They looked up and saw a star, As it shone in the east beyond them far. And to the earth, it gave great light, And so it continued both day and night.


[Verse 4] 
And by the light of that same star, Three wise men came from country far, To seek for a King was their intent, And to follow the star wherever it went.


[Verse 5] 
The star drew nigh to the north-west, O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest, And there it did both stop and stay, Right over the place where Jesus lay.


[Verse 6] 
Then entered in those wise men three, Full reverently upon their knee, And offered there in His presence, Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.


[Verse 7] 
Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord, Who hath made heaven and earth of nought, And with His blood mankind hath bought.
