[Verse 1] 
Jesus is Lord of all, Satan is under His feet, Jesus is reigning on high And all power is given to Him In heaven and earth.


[Verse 2] 
We are joined to Him, Satan is under our feet, We are seated on high And all authority is given To us through Him.


[Verse 3] 
One day we'll be like Him, Perfect in every way, Chosen to be His bride, Ruling and reigning with Him Forever more.
