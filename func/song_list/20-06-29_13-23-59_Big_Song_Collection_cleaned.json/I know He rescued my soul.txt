[Verse 1] 
I know He rescued my soul, His blood has covered my sin, I believe, I believe. My shame He's taken away, My pain is healed in His name, I believe, I believe. I'll raise a banner; My Lord has conquered the grave.


[Verse 2] 
My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives; My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives.


[Verse 3] 
You lift my burden, I'll rise with You: I'm dancing on this mountain-top To see Your kingdom come.


[Verse 4] 
My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives; My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives.
