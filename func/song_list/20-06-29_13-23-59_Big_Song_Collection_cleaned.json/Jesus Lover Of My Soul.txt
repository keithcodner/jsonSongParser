[Verse 1] 
[A]It's all about [Bm]You[G], [D]Je[A]sus, And all this is for [Bm]You[G], for Your [D]glory and Your [A]fame; It's not about [Bm]me[G], as if [D]You should do things [G]my way; [D]You alone are [A]God and I sur[G]render to Your [D]ways.


[Verse 2] 
[D]Je[G]sus, [A]lover of my [D]soul, [G]All consuming [D]fire is in Your [Asus]gaze;[A] [D]Je[G]sus, [A]I want You to [D]know, [G]I will follow [D]You all my [Asus]days.[A]


[Verse 3] 
For [D]no one else in [A]history is [Bm]like [G]You, And [D]history it[A]self belongs to [G]You; [D]Alpha and O[G]mega, You have [Bm]loved [G]me, And [D]I will spend e[G]ternity with [Asus]You.[A]
