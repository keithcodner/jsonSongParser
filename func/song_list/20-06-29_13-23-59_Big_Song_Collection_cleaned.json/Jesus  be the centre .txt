[Verse 1] 
Jesus, be the centre, Be my source, be my light, Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, be the Centre, Be my hope, be my song, Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
Be the fire in my heart, Be the wind in these sails; Be the reason that I live, Jesus, Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, be my vision, Be my path, be my guide, Jesus.
