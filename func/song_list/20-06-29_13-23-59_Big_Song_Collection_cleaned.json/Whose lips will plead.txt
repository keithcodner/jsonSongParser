[Verse 1] 
Whose lips will plead For the people of this land? Who'll stand in the gap, And who'll build up the wall, Before the long day of God's patience is over, Before the night comes When His judgement will fall?


[Verse 2] 
And whose eyes will weep For the people of this land? And whose hearts will break For the hearts made of stone, For those who are walking out intodarkness, Away from God's love, Without Christ, so alone?


[Verse 3] 
And whose ears can hear What the Spirit is saying To those who are willing To watch and to pray? Pray on till God's light Fills the skies over this land, The light of revival that brings a new day.
