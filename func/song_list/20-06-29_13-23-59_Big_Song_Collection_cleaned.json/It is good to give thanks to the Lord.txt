[Verse 1] 
It is good to give thanks to the Lord, To remember all He has done; Then God will remember our praises When He looks with love on His people.


[Verse 2] 
O give thanks to the Lord, For His love endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord, For the Lord alone is good.


[Verse 3] 
Our sin is the sin of our fathers, We have done wrong, we all have been evil; Like those who once lived in bondage, We paid no heed to all You had done.


[Verse 4] 
O give thanks to the Lord, For His love endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord, For the Lord alone is good.


[Verse 5] 
Our fathers forsook Your love, At the Red Sea they questioned their God; They fell from their faith in the desert, And put God to the test in the wilderness.


[Verse 6] 
O give thanks to the Lord, For His love endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord, For the Lord alone is good.


[Verse 7] 
Time after time He would rescue them, Yet in malice they dared to defy Him; Despite this He came to their aid When He heard their cries of distress.


[Verse 8] 
O give thanks to the Lord, For His love endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord, For the Lord alone is good.


[Verse 9] 
Save us, O Lord, in Your love; Bring us back from all that offends You. Look not alone at our sins, But remember your promise of mercy.


[Verse 10] 
O give thanks to the Lord, For His love endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord, For the Lord alone is good.


[Verse 11] 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel Both now and through all eternity; Let nations and people cry out And sing Amen! Alleluia! 


[Verse 12] 
O give thanks to the Lord, For His love endures forever. O give thanks to the Lord, For the Lord alone is good.
