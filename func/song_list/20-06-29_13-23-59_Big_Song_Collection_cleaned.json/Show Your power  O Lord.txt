[Verse 1] 
Show Your power, O Lord, Demonstrate the justice of Your kingdom. Prove Your mighty word. Vindicate Your name Before a watching world. ||Awesome are Your deeds, O Lord; Renew them for this hour. Show Your power, O Lord, Among the people now.


[Verse 2] 
Show Your power, O Lord, Cause Your church to rise and take action. Let all fear be gone, Powers of the age to come Are breaking through. ||We Your people are ready to serve, To arise and to obey. Show Your power, O Lord, And set the people free.
