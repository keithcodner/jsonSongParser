[Verse 1] 
Mighty is the Lord and most worthy of praise, Praise Him all you people. Look upon Him, God alone who saves: Praise the Lord of all. ||Nations will rise and nations will fall, Praise Him all you people. But there is One who is Lord of all: Praise the Lord of all.


[Verse 2] 
He is Wonderful, Counsellor, Glorious Prince of Peace. He is Lord and King of everything, His praises never cease. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Awesome and great, like the strongest tower, Praise Him all you people. He is the one with limitless power, Praise the Lord of all. ||Leaders may come and presidents fall, Praise Him all you people. But there is One who is Lord of all: Praise the Lord of all. 


[Verse 4] 
He is Wonderful, Counsellor, Glorious Prince of Peace. He is Lord and King of everything, His praises never cease. (Repeat)
