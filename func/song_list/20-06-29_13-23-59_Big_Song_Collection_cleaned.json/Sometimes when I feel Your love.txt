[Verse 1] 
Sometimes when I feel Your love As I walk along the busy street, I whisper Your name under my breath. And sometimes when I feel Your touch In the quiet place of my room, I sing Your name in adoration. ||And there are times when I feel like I'm bursting With Your love so strong and so true; And in my heart I feel such a yearning, And I want all the world To know You love them, too.


[Verse 2] 
I love Your love, Gonna shout it out aloud. I love Your love, Wanna tell the world about it. I love Your love, 'Cause I've found it to be true, And I live to love You, too.
