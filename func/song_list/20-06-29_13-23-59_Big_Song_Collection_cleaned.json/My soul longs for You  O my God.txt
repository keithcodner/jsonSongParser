[Verse 1] 
My soul longs for You, O my God; I seek You with all of my heart. In this dry and thirsty land My voice cries out to You; Only Your presence can satisfy my need.


[Verse 2] 
And so I enter into Your sanctuary, To behold Your glory. I'll give You my praise as long as I live, Raise my hands, my life I'll give To You, O I love You, Lord.
