[Verse 1] 
O Lord, the clouds are gathering, The fire of judgement burns, How we have fallen! O Lord, You stand appalled to see Your laws of love so scorned, And lives so broken.


[Verse 2] 
Have mercy, Lord, (Men) Have mercy, Lord, (Women) Forgive us, Lord, (Men) Forgive us, Lord, (Women) Restore us, Lord, (All) Revive Your church again. ||Let justice flow (Men) Let justice flow (Women) Like rivers, (Men) Like rivers, (Women) And righteousness like a Never failing stream. (All)


[Verse 3] 
O Lord, over the nations now Where is the dove of peace? Her wings are broken. O Lord, while precious children starve The tools of war increase; Their bread is stolen.


[Verse 4] 
Have mercy, Lord, (Men) Have mercy, Lord, (Women) Forgive us, Lord, (Men) Forgive us, Lord, (Women) Restore us, Lord, (All) Revive Your church again. ||Let justice flow (Men) Let justice flow (Women) Like rivers, (Men) Like rivers, (Women) And righteousness like a Never failing stream. (All)


[Verse 5] 
O Lord, dark powers are poised to flood Our streets with hate and fear; We must awaken! O Lord, let love reclaim the lives That sin would sweep away And let Your kingdom come.


[Verse 6] 
Have mercy, Lord, (Men) Have mercy, Lord, (Women) Forgive us, Lord, (Men) Forgive us, Lord, (Women) Restore us, Lord, (All) Revive Your church again. ||Let justice flow (Men) Let justice flow (Women) Like rivers, (Men) Like rivers, (Women) And righteousness like a Never failing stream. (All)


[Verse 7] 
Yet, O Lord, Your glorious cross shall tower Triumphant in this land, Evil confounding. Through the fire Your suffering church display The glories of her Christ: Praises resounding! 


[Verse 8] 
Have mercy, Lord, (Men) Have mercy, Lord, (Women) Forgive us, Lord, (Men) Forgive us, Lord, (Women) Restore us, Lord, (All) Revive Your church again. ||Let justice flow (Men) Let justice flow (Women) Like rivers, (Men) Like rivers, (Women) And righteousness like a Never failing stream. (All)
