[Verse 1] 
Meekness and majesty, Manhood and Deity, In perfect harmony, The Man who is God. Lord of eternity Dwells in humanity, Kneels in humility And washes our feet.


[Verse 2] 
O what a mystery, Meekness and majesty. Bow down and worship For this is your God, This is your God.


[Verse 3] 
Father's pure radiance, Perfect in innocence, Yet learns obedience To death on a cross. Suffering to give us life, Conquering through sacrifice, And as they crucify Prays: 'Father forgive.'


[Verse 4] 
O what a mystery, Meekness and majesty. Bow down and worship For this is your God, This is your God.


[Verse 5] 
Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible, Love indestructible In frailty appears. Lord of infinity, Stooping so tenderly, Lifts our humanity To the heights of His throne. 


[Verse 6] 
O what a mystery, Meekness and majesty. Bow down and worship For this is your God, This is your God.
