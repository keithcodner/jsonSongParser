[Verse 1] 
Father, into Your courts I will enter, Maker of heaven and earth, I tremble in Your holy presence. Glory, glory in Your sanctuary, Splendour and majesty, Lord, before You; All life adores You.


[Verse 2] 
All the earth will declare That Your love is everywhere. The fields will exalt, seas resound. Hear the trees' joyful cry, Praising You and so will I. A new song I'll sing, Lord, I will glorify and bless Your holy name.
