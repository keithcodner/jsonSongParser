[Verse 1] 
Thank You for saving me; What can I say? You are my everything, I will sing Your praise. You shed Your blood for me; What can I say? You took my sin and shame, A sinner called by name.


[Verse 2] 
Great is the Lord. Great is the Lord. For we know Your truth has set us free; You've set Your hope in me.


[Verse 3] 
Mercy and grace are mine, Forgiven is my sin; Jesus, my only hope, The Saviour of the world. 'Great is the Lord,' we cry; God, let Your kingdom come. Your word has let me see, Thank You for saving me. 


[Verse 4] 
Great is the Lord. Great is the Lord. For we know Your truth has set us free; You've set Your hope in me.
