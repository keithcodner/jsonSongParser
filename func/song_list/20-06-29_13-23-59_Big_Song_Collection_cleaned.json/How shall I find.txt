[Verse 1] 
How shall I find my place of rest, True wisdom and the hand of God? Not by my own understanding, But by Your Spirit in me.


[Verse 2] 
How shall I know the kind of love That cannot fade, that cannot fail? Not from this world's empty treasure, But by the promise of God.


[Verse 3] 
For You are the strength in my heart, So faithful when other loves fail me. Forever the strength in my heart: Jesus, Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
Your river flows, it covers me, Its blessing fills my life always, And sets my eyes on Your beauty And fills my heart with a song.


[Verse 5] 
For You are the strength in my heart, So faithful when other loves fail me. Forever the strength in my heart: Jesus, Jesus.
