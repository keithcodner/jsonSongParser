[Verse 1] 
I once was frightened of spiders, I once was frightened of the dark; I once was frightened of many, many things, Especially things that barked. ||But now I'm asking Jesus To help these fears to go, 'Cause I don't want them to be part of me, No, no, no, no, no.


[Verse 2] 
I once was frightened by thunder, And frightened by lightning too; I once was frightened by many, many things That crashed and banged and blew. ||But now I'm asking Jesus To help these fears to go, 'Cause I don't want them to be part of me, No, no, no, no, no.
