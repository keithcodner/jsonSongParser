[Verse 1] 
He brought me to His banqueting table, (Men-Women echo) He brought me to His banqueting table, (Men-Women echo) And His banner over me is love. (All)


[Verse 2] 
I am my Beloved's and He is mine, (Men-Women echo) I am my Beloved's and He is mine, (Men-Women echo) And His banner over me is love. (All) Yes, His banner over me is love.


[Verse 3] 
And we can feel the love of God in this place, We believe Your goodness, we receive Your grace. We delight ourselves at Your table, O God, You do all things well, just look at our lives.
