[Verse 1] 
It's a happy day, and I thank God for the weather. It's a happy day, living it for my Lord. It's a happy day, things are gonna get better, Living each day by the promises in God's word.


[Verse 2] 
It's a grumpy day, and I can't stand the weather. It's a grumpy day, living it for myself. It's a grumpy day, and things aren't gonna get better Living each day with my Bible up on my shelf.
