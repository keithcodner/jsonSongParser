[Verse 1] 
Hear, O shepherd of your people, Let Your face shine and we will be saved. Shine forth, O God, in this pagan darkness. Awaken Your power, and come to restore.


[Verse 2] 
O Lord of hosts, turn again now, Make Your church strong to speak out Your word. We'll not turn back from our great commission To reach the lost and save this land.


[Verse 3] 
Let Your power fall upon us, Give strength unto the sons of Your right hand. We now hear the call to seek You, Awaken Your power, and come to restore. 


[Verse 4] 
O Lord of hosts, turn again now, Make Your church strong to speak out Your word. We'll not turn back from our great commission To reach the lost and save this land.
