[Verse 1] 
My lips shall praise You, My great Redeemer; My heart will worship Almighty Saviour.


[Verse 2] 
You take all my guilt away, Turn the darkest night to brightest day, You are the restorer of my soul.


[Verse 3] 
My lips shall praise You, My great Redeemer; My heart will worship Almighty Saviour.


[Verse 4] 
Love that conquers every fear, In the midst of trouble You draw near, You are the restorer of my soul.


[Verse 5] 
My lips shall praise You, My great Redeemer; My heart will worship Almighty Saviour.


[Verse 6] 
You're the source of happiness, Bringing peace when I am in distress, You are the restorer of my soul. 


[Verse 7] 
My lips shall praise You, My great Redeemer; My heart will worship Almighty Saviour.
