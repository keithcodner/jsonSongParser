[Verse 1] 
I am a new creation, No more in condemnation, Here in the grace of God I stand. My heart is overflowing, My love just keeps on growing, Here in the grace of God I stand.


[Verse 2] 
And I will praise You Lord, Yes, I will praise You Lord, And I will sing of all that You have done.


[Verse 3] 
I am a new creation, No more in condemnation, Here in the grace of God I stand. My heart is overflowing, My love just keeps on growing, Here in the grace of God I stand.


[Verse 4] 
A joy that knows no limit, A lightness in my spirit, Here in the grace of God I stand. 


[Verse 5] 
I am a new creation, No more in condemnation, Here in the grace of God I stand. My heart is overflowing, My love just keeps on growing, Here in the grace of God I stand.
