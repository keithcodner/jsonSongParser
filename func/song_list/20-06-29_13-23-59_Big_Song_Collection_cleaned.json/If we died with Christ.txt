[Verse 1] 
If we died with Christ, We'll also live with Him, And if we endure, We'll also reign with Christ. If we deny Him, He will disown us, But if we're faithless, Faithful He remains.


[Verse 2] 
If we died with Christ, We'll also live with Him, And if we endure, We'll also reign with Christ. If we deny Him, He will disown us, But if we're faithless, Faithful He remains.


[Verse 3] 
If we please the Lord In this present world, We will inherit eternal life to come. For He has promised To raise us from the dead If we walk worthily of Christ the risen One.


[Verse 4] 
If we please the Lord In this present world, We will inherit eternal life to come. For He has promised To raise us from the dead If we walk worthily of Christ the risen One.


[Verse 5] 
A faithful Saviour and unending in mercy Is our God, the only true God. The suffering Servant, And our conquering Hero Are You, God, forever true God. You are worthy to receive our lives.


[Verse 6] 
A faithful Saviour and unending in mercy Is our God, the only true God. The suffering Servant, And our conquering Hero Are You, God, forever true God. You are worthy to receive our lives. Cleansed from sin and alive to Christ.
