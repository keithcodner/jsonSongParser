[Verse 1] 
I'm a friend of Jesus Christ, (echo) He's God's Son and He's alive, (echo) I will trust in Him it's true, (echo) He's always there to see me through.(echo)


[Verse 2] 
Sound off, Jesus! Sound off, is Lord! Sound off, Jesus! Sound off, is Lord!


[Verse 3] 
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ, (Repeat x3) Through Jesus, Jesus Christ.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus is the Boss of my life, He's the only one can make it come right. Jesus is the Boss of my life, Jesus is the Boss.


[Verse 5] 
I said, come on everybody and move your feet; The rhythm is hot, it's a powerful beat. The time is right to do some business, Get on your feet and be a witness To the Holy One, ||The King of kings, God's only Son; Jesus Christ, that's His name, He died to take our sin and shame.
