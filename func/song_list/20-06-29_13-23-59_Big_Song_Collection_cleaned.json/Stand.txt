[Verse 1] 
Today, today is the day I’m living for You No more doing it my way I make the change today

I don’t wanna talk about it I don’t wanna think about it I don’t wanna dream about it Living my way

Is for You my Jesus And I will stand, I’ll stand for You I’ll stand, I’ll Stand I’ll stand for You


[Verse 6] 
Whatever happens to me I make a promise to be True to my Lord and Saviour I will stand
