[Verse 1] 
You are the Lord, The famous One, famous One; Great is Your name in all the earth. The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious; Great is Your fame beyond the earth.


[Verse 2] 
And for all You've done and yet to do, With every breath, I'm praising You. Desire of nations and every heart, You alone are God, You alone are God.


[Verse 3] 
You are the Lord, The famous One, famous One; Great is Your name in all the earth. The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious; Great is Your fame beyond the earth.


[Verse 4] 
The Morning Star is shining through, And every eye is watching You. Revealed by nature and miracles, You are beautiful, You are beautiful.


[Verse 5] 
You are the Lord, The famous One, famous One; Great is Your name in all the earth. The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious; Great is Your fame beyond the earth.
