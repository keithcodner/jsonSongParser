[Verse 1] 
Beauty for ashes Joy for my pain You given me Wings to fly again 


[Verse 2] 
Strength for today To dance for my sorrows Because of You, Because of You


[Verse 3] 
Shades of grey turn to color A darkened night turns to day


[Verse 4] 
It's a new day It's a new day Shadows rise at the Glory of the Son|| It's a new day It's a new day The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 5] 
Hope for my future A life made brand new Because of you Because of you


[Verse 6] 
Chains of fear turn to freedom Silence breaks into praise


[Verse 7] 
It's a new day It's a new day It's a new, new day Since you came my way


[Verse 8] 
The past has gone And life has just begun


[Verse 9]
