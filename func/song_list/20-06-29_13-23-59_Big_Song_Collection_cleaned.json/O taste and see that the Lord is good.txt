[Verse 1] 
O taste and see that the Lord is good, How blessed is the man who hides himself in Him. I sought the Lord and He answered me And set me free from all my fears.


[Verse 2] 
I will give thanks to Him, for He is good, His steadfast love to me will never end. I will give thanks to Him, for He is good, His steadfast love to me will never end.
