[Verse 1] 
No-one but You, Lord, Can satisfy the longing in my heart. Nothing I do, Lord, Can take the place of drawing near to You.


[Verse 2] 
Only You can fill my deepest longing, Only You can breathe in me new life; Only You can fill my heart with laughter, Only You can answer my heart's cry.


[Verse 3] 
Father, I love You, Come satisfy the longing in my heart. Fill me, overwhelm me, Until I know Your love deep in my heart. 


[Verse 4] 
Only You can fill my deepest longing, Only You can breathe in me new life; Only You can fill my heart with laughter, Only You can answer my heart's cry.
