[Verse 1] 
When deep calls to deep There's a stirring inside of me, A feeling that words won't describe; Like I'm hearing Your song Touching my spirit, Calling me deeper with You.


[Verse 2] 
And the thirst in my soul Just to meet with You, God, I'm feeling the pull of Your love; Like the crash of Your waves, Like the roar or Your waterfalls, Drawing me on into You.


[Verse 3] 
And all I know is it's You. And I cry out to You.


[Verse 4] 
Give me oil for my wounds, Give me wine for my heart, Give me strength for today, And I will stand. Give me salve for my eyes, Give me truth for the lies, Give me love in my life And I will run with You.
