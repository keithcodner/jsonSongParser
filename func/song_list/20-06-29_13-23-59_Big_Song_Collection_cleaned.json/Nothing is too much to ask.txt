[Verse 1] 
Nothing is too much to ask Now that I have said I'm Yours, Jesus, take the whole of me Unreservedly.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, take me deeper now That I might go further too, I've received so much from You Undeservedly.


[Verse 3] 
I was made to love You, Lord, I was saved to worship You. You will be the focus Of all eternity.
