[Verse 1] 
Ride on, ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp ride on to die! O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin O'er captive death and conquered sin.


[Verse 2] 
Ride on, ride on in majesty! Hark all the tribes 'hosanna' cry; Thine humble beast pursues his road With palms and scattered garments strowed.


[Verse 3] 
Ride on, ride on in majesty! Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh; The Father on His sapphire throne Expects His own anointed Son.


[Verse 4] 
Ride on, ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp ride on to die! Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain, Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign!
