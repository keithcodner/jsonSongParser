[Verse 1] 
[G]Caught a glimpse of Your [Bm]splendor in the [D]corner [A]of my [G]eye, The most beautiful [Bm]thing I'd ever [A]seen;[G] [G]It was like a flash of [Bm]lightning re[D]flected [A]off the [G]sky, And I know I'll [Bm]never be the [A]same.[D]


[Verse 2] 
[D]Show me Your [Bm]glory, [G]Send down Your presence, I wanna see Your [A]face;[D] [D]Show me Your [Bm]glory, [G]Majesty shines about You and [G]I can't go on without You, Lord.


[Verse 3] 
[G]When I climb down the [Bm]mountain and [D]get back [A]to my [G]life, I won't settle for [Bm]ordinary [A]things;[G] [G]I'm gonna follow You [Bm]forever, for [D]all of [A]my [G]days; I won't rest until I [Bm]see You a[A]gain.[D]
