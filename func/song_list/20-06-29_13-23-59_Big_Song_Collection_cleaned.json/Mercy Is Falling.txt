Your [D]mercy is [G]falling, Is [D]falling, is [A]falling Your [D]mercy, it [G]falls Like the [Bm]sweet spring [A]rain; Your [D]mercy is [G]falling, Is [D]falling all [A]over [D]me.

[D]Hey-oh! I re[G]ceive Your [A]mercy! [D]Hey-oh! I re[Bm]ceive Your [A]grace! [D]Hey-oh! I will [G]dance for[A]ever[D]more!
