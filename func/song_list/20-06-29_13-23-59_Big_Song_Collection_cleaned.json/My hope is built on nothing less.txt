[Verse 1] 
My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus’ Name.


[Verse 2] 
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand; All other ground is sinking sand.


[Verse 3] 
When darkness hides His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil.


[Verse 4] 
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand; All other ground is sinking sand.


[Verse 5] 
His oath, His covenant, His blood, Support me in the 'whelming flood. When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.


[Verse 6] 
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand; All other ground is sinking sand.


[Verse 7] 
When He shall come with trumpet sound, Oh may I then in Him be found. Clothed in His righteousness alone, Faultless to stand before the throne.


[Verse 8] 
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand; All other ground is sinking sand.
