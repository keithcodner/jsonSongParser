[Verse 1] 
You are worthy to receive All the honour and praise. Lamb of God, Prince of Peace, We lift high Your name.


[Verse 2] 
For Yours is the greatness, The power and the glory; Lord of the nations, Have mercy on us. Though heaven be shaken, And earth's kingdoms fall, We will still worship You.


[Verse 3] 
In the footsteps of our King, We walk unafraid; Though the battle may rage, Our praises will ring. 


[Verse 4] 
For Yours is the greatness, The power and the glory; Lord of the nations, Have mercy on us. Though heaven be shaken, And earth's kingdoms fall, We will still worship You.
