[Verse 1] 
I thank You for the cross Where all my shame was laid, Broken by Your power, Banished to the grave. You gave Yourself for me, A sinner for a King, Offering Your death And suffering my sin.


[Verse 2] 
And I will give my life To You, Lord, For with grace You came To pay the ransom for my soul. And I will live my life For You, Lord. You brought me back from death, Into Your mercy on the cross.
