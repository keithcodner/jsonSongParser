[Verse 1] 
Whatever I have gained, Whatever I have done, I leave it all behind to follow You. The things that I attained, The goals I may have gained, A prize or any glory of my own.


[Verse 2] 
For I am lost without Your love, All things are loss without Your love; For I am lost without Your love, All things are loss without Your love.


[Verse 3] 
The wonder of Your love, The wonder of Your grace; To gain You and to know You as my Lord. That I am found in You, Your righteousness alone, Is more than I could dream or ever ask. 


[Verse 4] 
For I am lost without Your love, All things are loss without Your love; For I am lost without Your love, All things are loss without Your love.
