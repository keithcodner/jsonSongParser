[Verse 1] 
Hear my prayer, O Lord, From the ends of the earth I cry. Your peace will lead me to The Rock that is higher than I. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
For You have been my strength in times of trouble, A tower above my enemies. And Lord, I will abide with you forever In the shelter of Your wings. (Repeat)
