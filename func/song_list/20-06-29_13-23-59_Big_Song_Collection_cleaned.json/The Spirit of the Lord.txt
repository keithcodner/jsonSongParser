[Verse 1] 
The Spirit of the Lord, The sovereign Lord, is on me, Because He has anointed me To preach good news to the poor:


[Verse 2] 
Proclaiming Jesus, only Jesus - It is Jesus, Saviour, healer and baptiser, And the mighty King, The victor and deliverer - He is Lord, He is Lord, He is Lord!


[Verse 3] 
And He has called on me To bind up all the broken hearts, To minister release To every captivated soul:


[Verse 4] 
Proclaiming Jesus, only Jesus - It is Jesus, Saviour, healer and baptiser, And the mighty King, The victor and deliverer - He is Lord, He is Lord, He is Lord!


[Verse 5] 
Let| righteousness arise And blossom as a garden; Let praise begin to spring In every tongue and nation: 


[Verse 6] 
Proclaiming Jesus, only Jesus - It is Jesus, Saviour, healer and baptiser, And the mighty King, The victor and deliverer - He is Lord, He is Lord, He is Lord!
