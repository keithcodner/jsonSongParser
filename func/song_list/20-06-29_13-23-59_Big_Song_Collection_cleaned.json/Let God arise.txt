[Verse 1] 
Let God arise And let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him Flee before Him. Let God arise, And let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him Flee away.


[Verse 2] 
(Men) But let the righteous be glad, Let them exult before God, Let them rejoice with gladness, Building up a highway for the King. We go in the name of the Lord, Let the shout go up In the name of the Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Let God arise And let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him Flee before Him. Let God arise, And let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him Flee away.


[Verse 4] 
(Women) The righteous be glad, Let them exult before God, O let them rejoice For the King, In the name of the Lord. 


[Verse 5] 
Let God arise And let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him Flee before Him. Let God arise, And let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him Flee away.
