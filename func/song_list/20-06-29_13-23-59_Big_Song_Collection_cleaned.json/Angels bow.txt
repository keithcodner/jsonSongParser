[Verse 1] 
Angels bow before You, Kings fall at Your command. And yet Your love comes down to earth To fallen man. How can I know Your workings, Eternal mystery? I must bow down and give my life, Must follow You.


[Verse 2] 
And I love You, Lord, Everything belongs to You, Is known by You, And made for Your eternal glory. You, my Lord, receive the praise Of my thankful heart.
