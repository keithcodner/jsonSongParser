[Verse 1] 
I come, wanting just to be with You; Today let me hear Your voice. I come, wanting just to give to You, To say, You are everything.


[Verse 2] 
Don't ever let my heart grow cold, Don't ever let me lose sight of Your truth. Draw near that I may drink from eternal water.


[Verse 3] 
You are the Fountain of all life, You are the peace unto my soul. You are the Way, the Truth, the Light; Jesus, into Your arms I run. ||You are the holy Son of God, You gave up Your life to save my soul. You have redeemed me through the cross; Jesus, with thankfulness I come.
