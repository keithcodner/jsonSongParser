[Verse 1] 
Your love is amazing, Steady and unchanging; Your love is a mountain, Firm beneath my feet. Your love is a mystery, How You gently lift me; When I am surrounded, Your love carries me.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing. Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.


[Verse 3] 
Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising, All the joy that's growing Deep inside of me. Every time I see You, All Your goodness shines through, And I can feel this God song Rising up in me. 


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing. Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
