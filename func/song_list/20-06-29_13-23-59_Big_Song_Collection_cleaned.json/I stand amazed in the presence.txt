[Verse 1] 
I stand amazed in the presence Of Jesus the Nazarene, And wonder how He could love me, A sinner, condemned, unclean.


[Verse 2] 
How marvellous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be: How marvellous! How wonderful! Is my Saviour's love for me!


[Verse 3] 
For me it was in the garden He prayed, 'Not My will, but Thine': He had no tears for His own griefs, But sweat drops of blood for mine.


[Verse 4] 
How marvellous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be: How marvellous! How wonderful! Is my Saviour's love for me!


[Verse 5] 
In pity angels beheld Him, And came from the world of light To comfort Him in the sorrows He bore for my soul that night.


[Verse 6] 
How marvellous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be: How marvellous! How wonderful! Is my Saviour's love for me!


[Verse 7] 
He took my sins and my sorrows, He made them His very own; He bore the burden of Calvary, And suffered and died alone.


[Verse 8] 
How marvellous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be: How marvellous! How wonderful! Is my Saviour's love for me!


[Verse 9] 
When with the ransomed in glory His face I at last shall see, 'Twill be my joy through the ages To sing of His love for me. 


[Verse 10] 
How marvellous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be: How marvellous! How wonderful! Is my Saviour's love for me!
