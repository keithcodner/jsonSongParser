[Verse 1] 
Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest. Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest. Lord we lift up Your name, With hearts full of praise, Be exalted, O Lord, my God, Hosanna in the highest.


[Verse 2] 
Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings. Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings. Lord, we lift up Your name, With hearts full of praise, Be exalted, O Lord, my God, Glory to the King of kings.
