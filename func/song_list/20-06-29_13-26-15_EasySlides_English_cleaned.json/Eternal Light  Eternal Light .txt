[Verse 1] 
Eternal Light! Eternal Light! How pure the soul must be, when, placed within Thy searching sight, it shrinks not, but, with calm delight, can live, and look on Thee!


[Verse 2] 
The spirits that surround Thy throne may bear the burning bliss; but that is surely theirs alone, since they have never, never known a fallen world like this.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere is dark, whose mind is dim, before the Ineffable appear, and on my naked spirit bear the uncreated beam?


[Verse 4] 
There is a way for man to rise to that sublime abode: an offering and a sacrifice, a Holy Spiritâ€™s energies, an advocate with God;


[Verse 5] 
These, these prepare us for the sight of holiness above: the sons of ignorance and night may dwell in the eternal light, through the eternal love!
