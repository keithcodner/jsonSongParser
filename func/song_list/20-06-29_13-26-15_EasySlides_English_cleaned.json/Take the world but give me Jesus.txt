[Verse 1] 
Take the world, but give me Jesus! All its joys are but a name, but His love abideth ever, through eternal years the same.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, the height and depth of mercy! Oh, the length and breadth of love! Oh, the fullness of redemption, pledge of endless life above!


[Verse 3] 
Take the world, but give me Jesus, sweetest comfort of my soul; with my Saviour watching oâ€™er me I can sing, though billows roll.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, the height and depth of mercy! Oh, the length and breadth of love! Oh, the fullness of redemption, pledge of endless life above!


[Verse 5] 
Take the world, but give me Jesus! Let me view His constant smile; then throughout my pilgrim journey light will cheer me all the while.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, the height and depth of mercy! Oh, the length and breadth of love! Oh, the fullness of redemption, pledge of endless life above!


[Verse 7] 
Take the world, but give me Jesus! In His cross my trust shall be, till, with clearer, brighter vision, face to face my Lord I see.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, the height and depth of mercy! Oh, the length and breadth of love! Oh, the fullness of redemption, pledge of endless life above!
