[Verse 1] 
Church of God, beloved and chosen, church of God for whom Christ died, claim thy gifts and praise the Giver! Ye are washed and sanctified! Sanctified by God the Father, and by Jesus Christ His Son, and by God the Holy Spirit, holy, holy, Three in One.


[Verse 2] 
By His will He sanctifieth, by the Spirit’s power within; by the loving hand that chasteneth, fruits of righteousness to win; by His truth, and by His promise, by His Word, His gift unpriced, by His blood, and by our union With the risen life of Christ.


[Verse 3] 
Holiness by faith in Jesus. Not by effort of thine own, sin’s dominion crushed and broken, by the power of grace alone; God’s own holiness within thee, His own beauty on thy brow, this shall be thy pilgrim brightness, this thy blessed portion now.


[Verse 4] 
He will sanctify thee wholly; body, spirit, soul shall be blameless till thy Saviour’s coming in His glorious majesty: He hath perfected for ever those whom He hath sanctified; spotless, glorious and holy is the Church, His chosen Bride.
