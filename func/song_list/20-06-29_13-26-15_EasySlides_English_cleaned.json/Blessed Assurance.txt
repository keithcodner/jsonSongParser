[Verse 1] 
Bless√®d assurance, Jesus is mine: O what a foretaste of glory divine! Heir of salvation, purchase of God; Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.


[Verse 2] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Saviour all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Saviour all the day long.


[Verse 3] 
Perfect submission, perfect delight, Visions of rapture burst on my sight; Angels descending bring from above Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.


[Verse 4] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Saviour all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Saviour all the day long.


[Verse 5] 
Perfect submission, all is at rest, I in my Saviour am happy and blessed; Watching and waiting, looking above, Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.


[Verse 6] 
This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Saviour all the day long. This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Saviour all the day long.
