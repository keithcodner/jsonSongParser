[Verse 1] 
Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus daily let me go; higher, higher in the school of wisdom, more of grace to know.


[Verse 2] 
O deeper yet I pray, and higher every day, and wiser, blessed Lord, in Thy precious, holy word.


[Verse 3] 
Deeper, deeper! blessed Holy Spirit, take me deeper still, till my life is wholly lost in Jesus and His perfect will.


[Verse 4] 
O deeper yet I pray, and higher every day, and wiser, blessed Lord, in Thy precious, holy word.


[Verse 5] 
Deeper, deeper! though it cost hard trials, deeper let me go! Rooted in the holy love of Jesus, let me fruitful grow.


[Verse 6] 
O deeper yet I pray, and higher every day, and wiser, blessed Lord, in Thy precious, holy word.


[Verse 7] 
Deeper, higher every day in Jesus, till all conflict past, finds me conqueror, and in His own image perfected at last.


[Verse 8] 
O deeper yet I pray, and higher every day, and wiser, blessed Lord, in Thy precious, holy word.
