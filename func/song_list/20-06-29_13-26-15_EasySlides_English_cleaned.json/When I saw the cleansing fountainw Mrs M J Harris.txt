[Verse 1] 
When I saw the cleansing fountain open wide for all my sin, I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing when He said “Wilt thou be clean?”


[Verse 2] 
I will praise Him, I will praise Him, praise Him, praise the Lamb for sinners slain! Give Him glory all ye people, for His blood has washed away my stain.


[Verse 3] 
Though the way seemed straight and narrow, all I claimed was swept away; my ambition, plans and wishes, at my feet in ashes lay.


[Verse 4] 
I will praise Him, I will praise Him, praise Him, praise the Lamb for sinners slain! Give Him glory all ye people, for His blood has washed away my stain.


[Verse 5] 
Then God’s fire upon the altar of my heart was set aflame; I shall never cease to praise Him: glory! glory! to His name.


[Verse 6] 
I will praise Him, I will praise Him, praise Him, praise the Lamb for sinners slain! Give Him glory all ye people, for His blood has washed away my stain.


[Verse 7] 
Blessed be the name of Jesus, I’m so glad He took me in; He has pardoned my transgressions, He has cleansed my heart from sin.


[Verse 8] 
I will praise Him, I will praise Him, praise Him, praise the Lamb for sinners slain! Give Him glory all ye people, for His blood has washed away my stain.
