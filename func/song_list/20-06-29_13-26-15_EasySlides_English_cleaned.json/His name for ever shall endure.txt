[Verse 1] 
His name for ever shall endure; last like the sun it shall: men shall be blessed in Him, and blessed all nations shall Him call.


[Verse 2] 
Now blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel, for He alone doth wondrous works, in glory that excel.


[Verse 3] 
And blessed be His glorious name to all eternity: the whole earth let His glory fill. Amen, so let it be.
