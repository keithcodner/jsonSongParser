[Verse 1] 
I'm pressing on the upward way New heights I'm gaining every day Still praying as I onward bound "Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."


[Verse 2] 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand By faith on heaven's table land A higher plane than I have found Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.


[Verse 3] 
My heart has no desire to stay Where doubts arise and fears dismay Tho' some may dwell where these abound My prayer, my aim is higher ground.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand By faith on heaven's table land A higher plane than I have found Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.


[Verse 5] 
I want to live above the world Tho' satan's darts at me are hurled For faith has caught the joyful sound The song of saints on higher ground.


[Verse 6] 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand By faith on heaven's table land A higher plane than I have found Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.


[Verse 7] 
I want to scale the utmost height And catch a gleam of glory bright But still I'll pray till heaven I've found "Lord, lead me on to higher ground."


[Verse 8] 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand By faith on heaven's table land A higher plane than I have found Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
