[Verse 1] 
Am I a soldier of the cross a follower of the Lamb? And shall I fear to own His cause or blush to speak His name?


[Verse 2] 
In the name, the precious name of Him who died for me, through grace I’ll win the promised crown, whate’er my cross may be.


[Verse 3] 
Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the prize, and sailed through bloody seas?


[Verse 4] 
In the name, the precious name of Him who died for me, through grace I’ll win the promised crown, whate’er my cross may be.


[Verse 5] 
Are there no foes for me to face? Must I not stem the flood? Is this vile world a friend to grace, to help me on to God?


[Verse 6] 
In the name, the precious name of Him who died for me, through grace I’ll win the promised crown, whate’er my cross may be.


[Verse 7] 
Since I must fight if I would reign, increase my courage, Lord! I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain supported by Thy word.


[Verse 8] 
In the name, the precious name of Him who died for me, through grace I’ll win the promised crown, whate’er my cross may be.
