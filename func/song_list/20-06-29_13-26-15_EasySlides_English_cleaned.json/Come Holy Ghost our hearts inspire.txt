[Verse 1] 
Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire, let us Thine influence prove: source of the old prophetic fire, fountain of life and love.


[Verse 2] 
Come, Holy Ghost, for moved by Thee the prophets wrote and spoke; unlock the truth, Thyself the key, unseal the sacred book.


[Verse 3] 
Expand Thy wings, celestial Dove, brood o’er our nature’s night; on our disordered spirits move, and let there now be light.


[Verse 4] 
God, through Himself, we then shall know if Thou within us shine, and sound with all Thy saints below, the depths of love divine.
