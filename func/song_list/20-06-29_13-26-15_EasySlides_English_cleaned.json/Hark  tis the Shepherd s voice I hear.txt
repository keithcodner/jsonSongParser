[Verse 1] 
Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear, out in the desert dark and drear, calling the lambs who've gone astray, far from the Shepherd's fold away.


[Verse 2] 
Bring them in, bring them in, bring them in from the fields of sin; bring them in, bring them in, bring the wandering ones to Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind, help Him the wandering lambs to find? Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold, where they'll be sheltered from the cold?


[Verse 4] 
Bring them in, bring them in, bring them in from the fields of sin; bring them in, bring them in, bring the wandering ones to Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
Out in the desert hear their cry; out on the mountains wild and high; hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee, “Go, find My lambs, where'er they be.”


[Verse 6] 
Bring them in, bring them in, bring them in from the fields of sin; bring them in, bring them in, bring the wandering ones to Jesus.
