[Verse 1] 
Your only Son, no sin to hide But You have sent Him from Your side To walk upon this guilty sod And to become the Lamb of God


[Verse 2] 
Oh Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God I love the Holy Lamb of God Oh wash me in His precious blood My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God


[Verse 3] 
Your gift of Love they crucified They laughed and scorned Him as He died The humble King they named a fraud And sacrificed the Lamb of God


[Verse 4] 
Oh Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God I love the Holy Lamb of God Oh wash me in His precious blood My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God


[Verse 5] 
I was so lost, I should have died But You have brought me to Your side To be led by Your staff and rod And to be called the Lamb of God


[Verse 6] 
Oh Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God I love the Holy Lamb of God Oh wash me in His precious blood My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
