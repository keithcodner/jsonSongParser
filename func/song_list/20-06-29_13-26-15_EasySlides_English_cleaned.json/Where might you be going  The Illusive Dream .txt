[Verse 1] 
Where might you be going this fine day my friend, Off along an aimless road that soon must end, Chasing and illusive dream that shines so fair, But when found, it isn't there.


[Verse 2] 
I can understand your weary sigh, my friend, There, but the grace of God go I, my friend, Come and let Him lead you to your journey's end, Oh come along and walk with Him.


[Verse 3] 
If without the grace of God your life should end, And before the face of God you'd stand, my friend, What would your illusive dream avail you then? So come along and walk with Him.
