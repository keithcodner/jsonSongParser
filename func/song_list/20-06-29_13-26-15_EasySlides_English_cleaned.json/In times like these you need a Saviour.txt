[Verse 1] 
In times like these you need a Saviour, in times like these you need an anchor; be very sure, be very sure your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!


[Verse 2] 
This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One; this Rock is Jesus, The only One! Be very sure, be very sure your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!


[Verse 3] 
In times like these you need the Bible, in times like these O be not idle; be very sure, be very sure your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!


[Verse 4] 
In times like these I have a Saviour, in times like these I have an anchor; I’m very sure, I’m very sure my anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!


[Verse 5] 
This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One; this Rock is Jesus, The only One! I’m very sure, I’m very sure my anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!
