[Verse 1] 
The sands of time are sinking, the dawn of heaven breaks; the summer morn I’ve sighed for, the fair sweet morn awakes; dark, dark hath been the midnight, but dayspring is at hand, and glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, Christ, He is the fountain - the deep sweet well of love! The streams on earth I’ve tasted, more deep I’ll drink above; there to an ocean fullness His mercy doth expand, and glory, glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land.


[Verse 3] 
With mercy and with judgement my web of time He wove, and aye the dews of sorrow were lustred by His love; I’ll bless the hand that guided, I’ll bless the heart that planned, when throned where glory dwelleth in Immanuel’s land.


[Verse 4] 
The bride eyes not her garment, but her dear bridegroom’s face; I will not gaze at glory but on my King of grace, not at the crown He giveth, but on His pierced hand; the Lamb is all the glory of Immanuel’s land.


[Verse 5] 
I’ve wrestled on towards heaven, ‘gainst storm and wind and tide; now like a weary traveller that leaneth on his guide, amid the shades of evening, while sinks life’s lingering sand. I hail the glory, dawning in Immanuel’s land.
