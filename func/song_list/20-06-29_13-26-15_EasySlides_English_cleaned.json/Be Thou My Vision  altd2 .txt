[Verse 1] 
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart, Be all else but naught to me, save that Thou art; Be Thou my best thought in the day and the night, Both waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.


[Verse 2] 
Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word, Be Thou ever with me, and I with Thee, Lord; Be Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son; Be Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.


[Verse 3] 
Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight; Be Thou my whole armour, be Thou my true might; Be Thou my soul's shelter, be Thou my strong tower: O raise Thou me heavenward, great Power of my power.


[Verse 4] 
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise: Be Thou mine inheritance now and always; Be Thou and Thou only the first in my heart: O Sovereign of heaven, my treasure Thou art.


[Verse 5] 
High King of heaven, Thou heaven's bright Sun, O grant me its joys after victory is won; Great Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, Still be Thou my vision, O Ruler of all.
