[Verse 1] 
Jesus! I am resting, resting in the joy of what thou art; I am finding out the greatness of thy loving heart. Thou hast bid me gaze upon thee, and thy beauty fills my soul, for, by thy transforming power, thou hast made me whole.


[Verse 2] 
O how great thy loving-kindness, vaster, broader than the sea! O how marvellous thy goodness, lavished all on me! Yes, I rest in thee, Beloved, know what wealth of grace is thine, know thy certainty of promise, and have made it mine.


[Verse 3] 
Simply trusting thee, Lord Jesus, I behold thee as thou art, and thy love so pure, so changeless, satisfies my heart; satisfies its deepest longings, meets, supplies its every need, compasseth me round with blessings; thine is love indeed!


[Verse 4] 
Ever lift thy face upon me as I work and wait for thee; resting 'neath thy smile, Lord Jesus, earth's dark shadows flee. Brightness of my Father's glory, sunshine of my Father's face, keep me ever trusting, resting, fill me with thy grace.
