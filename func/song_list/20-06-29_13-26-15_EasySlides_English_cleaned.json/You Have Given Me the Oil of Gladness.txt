[Verse 1] 
You have given me the oil of gladness The garment of praise instead of mourning, A shining crown instead of ashes, And glory in the place of despair.


[Verse 2] 
I delight greatly in You, My soul rejoices and sings For You took my empty life, And filled it with every good thing.


[Verse 3] 
You have given me the oil of gladness The garment of praise instead of mourning, A shining crown instead of ashes, And glory in the place of despair.


[Verse 4] 
When my life was without purpose, You gave me a reason to live Now my heart is full of thanksgiving, For all of the riches You give.


[Verse 5] 
You have given me the oil of gladness The garment of praise instead of mourning, A shining crown instead of ashes, And glory in the place of despair.
