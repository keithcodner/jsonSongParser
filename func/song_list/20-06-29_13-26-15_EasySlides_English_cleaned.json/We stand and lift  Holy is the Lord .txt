[Verse 1] 
We stand and lift up our hands, For the joy of the Lord is our strength. We bow down and worship him now, How great, how awesome is He. And together we sing: (Everyone sing)


[Verse 2] 
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty, The earth is filled with his glory. Holy is the Lord, God Almighty, The earth is filled with his glory, The earth is filled with his glory.


[Verse 3] 
It's rising up all around, It's the anthem of the Lord's renown.
