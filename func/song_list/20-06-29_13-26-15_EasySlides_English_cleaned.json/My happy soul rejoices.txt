[Verse 1] 
My happy soul rejoices, the sky is bright above; I’ll join the heavenly voices and sing redeeming love.


[Verse 2] 
For there’s power in Jesus’ blood, power in Jesus’ blood, there’s power in Jesus’ blood to wash me white as snow.


[Verse 3] 
I heard the blessed story of Him who died to save; the love of Christ swept o’er me, my all to Him I gave.


[Verse 4] 
For there’s power in Jesus’ blood, power in Jesus’ blood, there’s power in Jesus’ blood to wash me white as snow.


[Verse 5] 
His gracious words of pardon were music to my heart; He took away my burden, and bade my fears depart.


[Verse 6] 
For there’s power in Jesus’ blood, power in Jesus’ blood, there’s power in Jesus’ blood to wash me white as snow.


[Verse 7] 
I plunge beneath this fountain, that cleanseth white as snow; it pours from Calvary’s mountain, with blessings in its flow.


[Verse 8] 
For there’s power in Jesus’ blood, power in Jesus’ blood, there’s power in Jesus’ blood to wash me white as snow.


[Verse 9] 
Oh, crown Him King for ever, my Saviour and my Friend! By Zion’s crystal river His praise shall never end.


[Verse 10] 
For there’s power in Jesus’ blood, power in Jesus’ blood, there’s power in Jesus’ blood to wash me white as snow.
