[Verse 1] 
There is one body, We have one Lord, United in the spirit, We are going forth.


[Verse 2] 
With His praises on our lips, And a sword in our hands, We are marching on with power, As we possess this land.


[Verse 3] 
We are the people of the Lord, We're a holy nation, A chosen generation, Called to show forth His praise.


[Verse 4] 
We are the people of the Lord, We're a holy nation, Believers in Jesus, Lifting up our voices to the Lord.
