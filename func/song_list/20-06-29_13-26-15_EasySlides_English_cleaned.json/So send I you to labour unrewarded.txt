[Verse 1] 
So send I you to labour unrewarded, to serve unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown, to bear rebuke, to suffer scorn and scoffing, so send I you, to toil for Me alone.


[Verse 2] 
So send I you to bind the bruised and broken, o'er wandering souls to work, to weep, to wake, to bear the burdens of a world aweary, so send I you, to suffer for My sake.


[Verse 3] 
So send I you to loneliness and longing, with heart a-hungering for the loved and known, forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one, so send I you, to know My love alone.


[Verse 4] 
So send I you to leave your life's ambition, to die to dear desire, self-will resign, to labour long and love where men revile you, so send I you, to lose your life in Mine.


[Verse 5] 
So send I you to hearts made hard by hatred, to eyes made blind because they will not see, to spend, though it be blood, to spend and spare not, so send I you, to taste of Calvary. “As the Father hath sent Me, so send I you.”
