[Verse 1] 
There’s peace in the heart that has Christ for its king; for His reign and His peace have no end: in His shelter secure and at rest we can sing, for His foes to His sceptre must bend.


[Verse 2] 
Then welcome, O Lord, to the throne of my heart! I’d hail Thee my Saviour and King! Be Thine all my service, for worthy Thou art, and forever Thy praise I will sing, and forever Thy praise I will sing.


[Verse 3] 
There’s truth in the heart when the Lord reigns within, in the heart and the life, day by day, with a conscience that seeks to be blameless from sin and His bidding alone to obey.


[Verse 4] 
Then welcome, O Lord, to the throne of my heart! I’d hail Thee my Saviour and King! Be Thine all my service, for worthy Thou art, and forever Thy praise I will sing, and forever Thy praise I will sing.


[Verse 5] 
There’s strength in the heart when the Lord is its king; not a task, but His grace will empower; not a foe, but His hand will deprive of its sting; blessed Shield and Protector and Tower!


[Verse 6] 
Then welcome, O Lord, to the throne of my heart! I’d hail Thee my Saviour and King! Be Thine all my service, for worthy Thou art, and forever Thy praise I will sing, and forever Thy praise I will sing.


[Verse 7] 
There’s joy in the heart that has Christ on the throne, such as none but Himself can impart; ‘tis a joy that remaineth when earth’s joys are flown, ‘tis a fullness of joy in the heart.


[Verse 8] 
Then welcome, O Lord, to the throne of my heart! I’d hail Thee my Saviour and King! Be Thine all my service, for worthy Thou art, and forever Thy praise I will sing, and forever Thy praise I will sing.
