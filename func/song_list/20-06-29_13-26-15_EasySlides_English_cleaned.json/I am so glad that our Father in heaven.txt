[Verse 1] 
I am so glad that our Father in heaven tells of His love in the Book He has given: wonderful things in the Bible I see: this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.


[Verse 2] 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus loves me and I know I love Him; love brought Him down my lost soul to redeem, yes, it was love made Him die on the tree; oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!


[Verse 4] 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.


[Verse 5] 
In this assurance I find sweetest rest, trusting in Jesus I know I am blest; Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee, when I just tell him that Jesus loves me.


[Verse 6] 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.


[Verse 7] 
Oh, if there's only one song I can sing, when in His beauty I see the great King, this shall my song in eternity be, “Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!”


[Verse 8] 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.
