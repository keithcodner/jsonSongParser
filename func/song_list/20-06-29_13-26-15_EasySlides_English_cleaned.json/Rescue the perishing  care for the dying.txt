[Verse 1] 
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, snatch them in pity from sin and the grave: weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen, tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.


[Verse 2] 
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying; Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.


[Verse 3] 
Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting, waiting the penitent child to receive. Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently: He will forgive if they only believe.


[Verse 4] 
Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter, feelings lie buried that grace can restore: touched by a loving hand, wakened by kindness, chords that were broken will vibrate once more.


[Verse 5] 
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it! Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide; back to the narrow way patiently win them; tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.
