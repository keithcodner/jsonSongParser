[Verse 1] 
O what a wonderful, wonderful day, day I will never forget; after I’d wandered in darkness away, Jesus my Saviour I met. O what a tender, compassionate friend He met the need of my heart; shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling, He made all the darkness depart!


[Verse 2] 
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, when at the cross the Saviour made me whole; my sins were washed away and my night was turned to day; heaven came down and glory filled my soul!


[Verse 3] 
Born of the Spirit with life from above into God’s family divine, justified fully through Calvary’s love, O what a standing is mine! And the transaction so quickly was made when as a sinner I came, took of the offer of grace He did proffer; He saved me, O praise His dear name!


[Verse 4] 
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, when at the cross the Saviour made me whole; my sins were washed away and my night was turned to day; heaven came down and glory filled my soul!


[Verse 5] 
Now I’ve a hope that will surely endure after the passing of time; I have a future in Heaven for sure, there in those mansions sublime. And it’s because of that wonderful day, when at the cross I believed; riches eternal and blessings supernal from His precious hand I received.


[Verse 6] 
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, when at the cross the Saviour made me whole; my sins were washed away and my night was turned to day; heaven came down and glory filled my soul!
