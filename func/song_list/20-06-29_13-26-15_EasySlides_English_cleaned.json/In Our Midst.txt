[Verse 1] 
Be magnified and lifted high Open up our eyes to see your glory Give us sight for we are blind but long to see the wonder of your beauty


[Verse 2] 
Holy spirit come Glorify the son Holy spirit come Glorify the son in our midst be glorified in our praise reveal your life in your love alone we're satisifed


[Verse 3] 
Be magnified and lifted high Only You alone are so worthy Take my life and make it yours and fill it with the wonder of your glory


[Verse 4] 
Holy spirit come Glorify the son Holy spirit come Glorify the son in our midst be glorified in our praise reveal your life in your love alone we're satisifed
