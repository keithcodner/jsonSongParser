[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me over life’s tempestuous sea! Unknown waves before me roll, hiding rocks and treacherous shoal; chart and compass come from Thee; Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!


[Verse 2] 
As a mother stills her child, Thou canst hush the ocean wild; boisterous waves obey Thy will when Thou say’st to them, “Be still!” Wondrous Sovereign of the sea, Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!


[Verse 3] 
When at last I near the shore, and the fearful breakers roar ‘twixt me and the peaceful rest, then, while leaning on Thy breast, may I hear Thee say to me, “Fear not, I will pilot thee!”
