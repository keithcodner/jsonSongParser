[Verse 1] 
As little children, we would dream of Christmas morn And all the gifts and toys we knew we'd find But we never realized a baby born one blessed night Gave us the greatest gift of our lives 


[Verse 2] 
We were the reason that He gave His life We were the reason that He suffered and died To a world that was lost He gave all He could give To show us the reason to live


[Verse 3] 
As the years went by, we learnt more about gifts The giving of ourselves and what that means On a dark and cloudy day a man hung crying in the rain Because of love, because of love 


[Verse 4] 
We were the reason that He gave His life We were the reason that He suffered and died To a world that was lost He gave all He could give To show us the reason to live


[Verse 5] 
I've finally found the reason for living It's in giving every part of my heart to Him In all that I do, every word that I say I'll be giving my all just for Him, just for Him 


[Verse 6] 
We were the reason that He gave His life We were the reason that He suffered and died To a world that was lost He gave all He could give To show us the reason to live
