[Verse 1] 
Lord, I believe a rest remains to all Thy people known; a rest where pure enjoyment reigns, and Thou art loved alone.


[Verse 2] 
A rest where all our soulâ€™s desire is fixed on things above; where fear and sin and grief expire, cast out by perfect love.


[Verse 3] 
Oh that I now the rest might know, believe, and enter in; now, Saviour, now the power bestow, and let me cease from sin.


[Verse 4] 
Remove this hardness from my heart, this unbelief remove: to me the rest of faith impart, the Sabbath of Thy love.


[Verse 5] 
I would be Thine, Thou knowest I would, and have Thee all my own; Thee, O my all-sufficient Good, I want, and Thee alone.
