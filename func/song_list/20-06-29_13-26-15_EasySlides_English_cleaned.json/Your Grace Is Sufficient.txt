[Verse 1] 
Your grace is sufficient for me Your strength is made perfect when I am weak All that I cling to I lay at your feet Your grace is sufficient for me


[Verse 2] 
I'm no longer striving to merit Your love I rest in your promise to me That all of my sins have been washed in Your blood Your mercy is all that I need


[Verse 3] 
Your grace is sufficient for me Your strength is made perfect when I am weak All that I cling to I lay at your feet Your grace is sufficient for me


[Verse 4] 
You see me as righteous because of the blood That made the atonement for me Your mercy has triumphed where I should be judged So now by your grace I am free.


[Verse 5] 
Your grace is sufficient for me Your strength is made perfect when I am weak All that I cling to I lay at your feet Your grace is sufficient for me
