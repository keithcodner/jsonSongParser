[Verse 1] 
I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord; no tender voice like Thine can peace afford.


[Verse 2] 
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee, every hour I need Thee; oh, bless me now, my Saviour! I come to Thee!


[Verse 3] 
I need Thee every hour, stay Thou near by; temptations lose their power when Thou art nigh.


[Verse 4] 
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee, every hour I need Thee; oh, bless me now, my Saviour! I come to Thee!


[Verse 5] 
I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain; come quickly and abide, or life is vain.


[Verse 6] 
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee, every hour I need Thee; oh, bless me now, my Saviour! I come to Thee!


[Verse 7] 
I need Thee every hour, teach me Thy will; and Thy rich promises in me fulfil.


[Verse 8] 
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee, every hour I need Thee; oh, bless me now, my Saviour! I come to Thee!


[Verse 9] 
I need Thee every hour, most Holy One: oh, keep me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son!


[Verse 10] 
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee, every hour I need Thee; oh, bless me now, my Saviour! I come to Thee!
