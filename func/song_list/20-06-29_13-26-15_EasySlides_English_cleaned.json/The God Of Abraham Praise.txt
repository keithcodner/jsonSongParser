[Verse 1] 
The God of abraham praise, Who reigns enthroned above, Ancient of everlasting days, and God of love. Jehovah! Great I AM! By earth and heaven confessed; I bow and bless the sacred name Forever blessed.


[Verse 2] 
The God of Abraham praise, At whose supreme command From earth I rise, and seek the joys At His right hand. I all on earth forsake- Its wisdom, fame, and power- And Him my only portion make, Mmy shield and tower.


[Verse 3] 
The God of Abraham praise, Whose all-sufficient grace Shall guide me all my happy days In all my ways. He calls a worm His friend, He calls Himself my God; And He shall save me to the end Through Jesu's blood.


[Verse 4] 
He by Himself hath sworn, I on His oath depend: I shall, on eagles' wings upborne, To heaven ascend; I shall behold His face, I shall His power adore, And sing the wonders of His grace Forever more.


[Verse 5] 
There dwells the Lord our King, The Lord our Righteousness, Triumphant o'er the world and sin, The Prince of Peace; On Zion's sacred height His kingdom still maintains, And glorious with His saints in light Forever reigns.


[Verse 6] 
The God who reigns on high The great archangels sing; And, holy, holy, holy, cry, Almighty King. Who was and is the same, And ever more shall be; Jehovah, Father, Great I AM, We worship Thee.


[Verse 7] 
Before the Saviour's face The ransomed nations bow; O'erwhelmed at His almighty grace, Forever new: He shows His prints of love, They kindle to a flame, And sound through all the worlds above The slaughtered Lamb.


[Verse 8] 
The whole triumphant host Give thanks to God on high; Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! They ever cry. Hail, Abraham's God, and mine! I join the heavenly lays; All might and majesty are Thine, And endless praise.
