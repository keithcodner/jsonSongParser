[Verse 1] 
While shepherds watched their flocks by night, All seated on the ground, The angel of the Lord came down And glory shone around.


[Verse 2] 
'Fear not' said he, for mighty dread Had seized their troubled mind; 'Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind.


[Verse 3] 
'To you in David's town this day Is born of David's line A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, And this shall be the sign.


[Verse 4] 
'The heavenly babe you there shall find To human view displayed, All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands, And in a manger laid.'


[Verse 5] 
Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith Appeared a shining throng Of angels, praising God, who thus Addressed their joyful song:


[Verse 6] 
'All glory be to God on high And on the earth be peace; Goodwill henceforth from heaven to men Begin and never cease.'
