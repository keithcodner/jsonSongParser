[Verse 1] 
I once was a stranger to grace and to God, I knew not my danger and felt not my load; though friends spoke in rapture of Christ on the tree, Jehovah Tsidkenu was nothing to me.


[Verse 2] 
Like tears from the daughters of Zion that roll, I wept when the waters went over His soul; yet thought not that my sins had nailed to the tree Jehovah Tsidkenu; ‘twas nothing to me.


[Verse 3] 
When free grace awoke me by light from on high, then legal fears shook me, I trembled to die; no refuge, no safety in self could I see, Jehovah Tsidkenu my Saviour must be.


[Verse 4] 
My terrors all vanished before the sweet name, my guilty fears banished, with boldness I came to drink at the fountain, life-giving and free, Jehovah Tsidkenu is all things to me.


[Verse 5] 
E’en treading the valley, the shadow of death, this watchword shall rally my faltering breath; for when from life’s fever my God sets me free, Jehovah Tsidkenu my deathsong shall be.
