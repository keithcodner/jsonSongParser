[Verse 1] 
It's not often I feel like lifting my hands in worship It's not often I feel like singing a song of joy But I'm often reminded of His ways and how He's so faithful So I'll offer Him this sacrifice of praise


[Verse 2] 
All that is in me, all that I am, there's nothing I withhold from Him All that is in me, all that I am will glorify the Lamb


[Verse 3] 
It's not often enough my heart and spirit are broken It's not often enough that He finds me on my knees But so often He comes in His cleansing love and forgives me So I'll offer Him this sacrifice of praise


[Verse 4] 
All that is in me, all that I am, there's nothing I withhold from Him All that is in me, all that I am will glorify the Lamb


[Verse 5] 
It's not often enough I seek Him through all He's given It's not often enough I seek him in His Word But so often I stand amazed that I'm one He's chosen So I'll offer Him this sacrifice of praise


[Verse 6] 
All that is in me, all that I am, there's nothing I withhold from Him All that is in me, all that I am will glorify the Lamb
