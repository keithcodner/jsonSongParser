[Verse 1] 
God is here, and that to bless us with the Spirit's quickening power; see, the cloud already bending, waits to drop the grateful shower.


[Verse 2] 
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee, let the shower of blessing fall; we are waiting, we are waiting, oh, revive the hearts of all.


[Verse 3] 
God is here! We feel His presence in this consecrated place: but we need the soul refreshing of His free, unbounded grace.


[Verse 4] 
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee, let the shower of blessing fall; we are waiting, we are waiting, oh, revive the hearts of all.


[Verse 5] 
God is here! Oh, then, believing, bring to Him our one desire, that His love may now be kindled, till its flame each heart inspire.


[Verse 6] 
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee, let the shower of blessing fall; we are waiting, we are waiting, oh, revive the hearts of all.


[Verse 7] 
Saviour, grant the prayer we offer, while in simple faith we bow! From the windows of Thy mercy pour us out a blessing now.


[Verse 8] 
Let it come, O Lord, we pray Thee, let the shower of blessing fall; we are waiting, we are waiting, oh, revive the hearts of all.
