Love the Lord your God with all your heart, Love the Lord your God with all of your soul, Love the Lord your God with all your strength, Love the Lord your God with everything.

So I'll love the Lord my God with all my heart, Love the Lord my God with all of my soul, Love the Lord my God with all my strength, Love the Lord my God with everything.

We'll love the Lord our God with all our hearts, Love the Lord our God with all of our souls, Love the Lord our God with all our strength, Love the Lord our God with everything.
