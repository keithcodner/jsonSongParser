[Verse 1] 
There’s a wideness in God’s mercy like the wideness of the sea; there’s a kindness in His justice which is more than liberty.


[Verse 2] 
There is plentiful redemption in the blood that has been shed; there is joy for all the members in the sorrows of the Head.


[Verse 3] 
There is grace enough for thousands of new worlds as great as this; there is room for fresh creations in that upper home of bliss.


[Verse 4] 
For the love of God is broader than the measures of man’s mind; and the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.


[Verse 5] 
But we make His love too narrow by false limits of our own; and we magnify His strictness with a zeal He will not own.


[Verse 6] 
If our love were but more simple we should take Him at His word; and our lives would be illumined by the presence of our Lord.
