[Verse 1] 
Here in Thy name we are gathered, come and revive us, O Lord; “There shall be showers of blessing,” Thou hast declared in Thy Word.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, graciously hear us, graciously hear us, we pray; pour from Thy windows upon us showers of blessing to-day.


[Verse 3] 
Oh! that the showers of blessing now on our souls may descend, while at the footstool of mercy pleading Thy promise we bend.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, graciously hear us, graciously hear us, we pray; pour from Thy windows upon us showers of blessing to-day.


[Verse 5] 
There shall be showers of blessing, promise that never can fail; Thou wilt regard our petition; surely our faith will prevail.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, graciously hear us, graciously hear us, we pray; pour from Thy windows upon us showers of blessing to-day.


[Verse 7] 
Showers of blessing, we need them, showers of blessing from Thee; showers of blessing, oh, grant them! Thine all the glory shall be.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, graciously hear us, graciously hear us, we pray; pour from Thy windows upon us showers of blessing to-day.
