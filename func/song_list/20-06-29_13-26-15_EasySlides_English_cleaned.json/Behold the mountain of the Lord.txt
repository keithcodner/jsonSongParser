[Verse 1] 
Behold! the mountain of the Lord in latter days shall rise on mountain tops above the hills, and draw the wondering eyes.


[Verse 2] 
To this the joyful nations round, all tribes and tongues, shall flow; up to the hill of God, they’ll say, and to His house we’ll go.


[Verse 3] 
The beam that shines from Zion hill shall lighten every land; the King who reigns in Salem’s towers shall all the world command.


[Verse 4] 
Among the nations He shall judge; His judgements truth shall guide; His sceptre shall protect the just, and quell the sinner’s pride.


[Verse 5] 
No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds disturb those peaceful years; to ploughshares men shall beat their swords, to pruning-hooks their spears.


[Verse 6] 
No longer hosts encountering hosts shall crowds of slain deplore: they hang the trumpet in the hall, and study war no more.


[Verse 7] 
Come then, O house of Jacob! come to worship at His shrine; and, walking in the light of God, with holy beauties shine.
