[Verse 1] 
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord, a wonderful Saviour to me: he hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, where rivers of pleasure I see.


[Verse 2] 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, that shadows a dry, thirsty land; he hideth my life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there with his hand.


[Verse 3] 
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord, he taketh my burden away; he holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved, he giveth me strength as my day.


[Verse 4] 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, that shadows a dry, thirsty land; he hideth my life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there with his hand.


[Verse 5] 
With numberless blessings each moment he crowns, and, filled with his goodness divine, I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God for such a Redeemer as mine!


[Verse 6] 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, that shadows a dry, thirsty land; he hideth my life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there with his hand.


[Verse 7] 
When clothed in his brightness transported I rise to meet him in clouds of the sky, his perfect salvation, his wonderful love, I'll shout with the millions on high.


[Verse 8] 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, that shadows a dry, thirsty land; he hideth my life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there with his hand.
