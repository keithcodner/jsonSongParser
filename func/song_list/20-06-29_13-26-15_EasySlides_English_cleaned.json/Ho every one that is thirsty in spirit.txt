[Verse 1] 
Ho, every one that is thirsty in spirit, ho, every one that is weary and sad; come to the fountain, there’s fullness in Jesus, all that you’re longing for, come and be glad.


[Verse 2] 
“I will pour water on him that is thirsty, I will pour floods upon the dry ground; open your heart for the gift I am bringing; while ye are seeking Me, I will be found.”


[Verse 3] 
Child of the world, are you tired of your bondage? weary of earth-joys, so false, so untrue? thirsting for God and His fullness of blessing? List to the promise, a message for you!


[Verse 4] 
“I will pour water on him that is thirsty, I will pour floods upon the dry ground; open your heart for the gift I am bringing; while ye are seeking Me, I will be found.”


[Verse 5] 
Child of the Kingdom, be filled with the Spirit! Nothing but fullness thy longing can meet: ‘tis the enduement for life and for service; Thine is the promise, so certain, so sweet.


[Verse 6] 
“I will pour water on him that is thirsty, I will pour floods upon the dry ground; open your heart for the gift I am bringing; while ye are seeking Me, I will be found.”
