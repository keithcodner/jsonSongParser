[Verse 1] 
Be still my soul Be still my soul Cease from the labour and the toil Refreshing springs of peace await To troubled minds and hearts that ache


[Verse 2] 
Be still my soul God knows your way And He will guide For His name's sake Plunge in the rivers of His grace Rest in the arms of His embrace


[Verse 3] 
Be still my soul Be still my soul Though battle round you rage and roar One thing you need and nothing more To hear the whisper of the Lord


[Verse 4] 
Be still my child I know your ways And I will guide For My name's sake Plunge in the rivers of My grace Rest in the arms of My embrace
