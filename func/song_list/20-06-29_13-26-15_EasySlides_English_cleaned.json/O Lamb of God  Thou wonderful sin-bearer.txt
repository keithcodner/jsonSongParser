[Verse 1] 
O Lamb of God! Thou wonderful sin-bearer, hard after Thee my soul doth follow on; as pants the hart for streams in desert dreary, so pants my soul for Thee, O Thou life-giving One.


[Verse 2] 
At Thy feet I fall, yield Thee up my all, to suffer, live, or die for my Lord crucified.


[Verse 3] 
I mourn, I mourn the sin that drove Thee from me, and blackest darkness brought into my soul; now I renounce the accursed thing that hindered, and come once more to Thee, to be made fully whole.


[Verse 4] 
At Thy feet I fall, yield Thee up my all, to suffer, live, or die for my Lord crucified.


[Verse 5] 
Descend the heavens, Thou whom my soul adoreth! Exchange Thy throne for my poor longing heart; for Thee, for Thee I watch as for the morning; no rest or peace is mine from my Saviour apart.


[Verse 6] 
At Thy feet I fall, yield Thee up my all, to suffer, live, or die for my Lord crucified.


[Verse 7] 
Come, Holy Ghost, Thy mighty aid bestowing, destroy the works of sin, the self, the pride; burn, burn in me, my idols overthrowing, prepare my heart for Him, for my Lord crucified!


[Verse 8] 
At Thy feet I fall, yield Thee up my all, to suffer, live, or die for my Lord crucified.
