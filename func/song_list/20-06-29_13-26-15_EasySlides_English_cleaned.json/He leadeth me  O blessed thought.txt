[Verse 1] 
He leadeth me! O blessed thought, O words with heavenly comfort fraught; whate’er I do, where’er I be, still ‘tis God’s hand that leadeth me.


[Verse 2] 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me! By His own hand He leadeth me; His faithful follower I would be, for by His hand He leadeth me.


[Verse 3] 
Sometimes ‘mid scenes of deepest gloom, sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom, by waters still, o’er troubled sea, still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me.


[Verse 4] 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me! By His own hand He leadeth me; His faithful follower I would be, for by His hand He leadeth me.


[Verse 5] 
Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine, nor ever murmur or repine; content, whatever lot I see, since ‘tis my God that leadeth me.


[Verse 6] 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me! By His own hand He leadeth me; His faithful follower I would be, for by His hand He leadeth me.


[Verse 7] 
And when my task on earth is done, when, by Thy grace, the victory’s won, e’en death’s cold wave I will not flee, since Thou through Jordan leadest me.


[Verse 8] 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me! By His own hand He leadeth me; His faithful follower I would be, for by His hand He leadeth me.
