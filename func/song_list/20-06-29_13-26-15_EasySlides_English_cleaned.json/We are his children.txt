[Verse 1] 
We are his children, the fruit of his suffering, saved and redeemed by his blood; called to be holy, a light to the nations: clothed with his power, filled with his love.


[Verse 2] 
Go forth in his name, proclaiming, 'Jesus reigns!' Now is the time for the church to arise and proclaim him 'Jesus, Saviour, Redeemer and Lord'. (Repeat)


[Verse 3] 
Countless the souls that are stumbling in darkness; why do we sleep in the light? Jesus commands us to go make disciples, this is our cause, this is our fight.


[Verse 4] 
Go forth in his name, proclaiming, 'Jesus reigns!' Now is the time for the church to arise and proclaim him 'Jesus, Saviour, Redeemer and Lord'. (Repeat)


[Verse 5] 
Listen, the wind of the Spirit is blowing, the end of the age is so near; powers in the earth and heavens are shaking, Jesus our Lord soon shall appear.


[Verse 6] 
Go forth in his name, proclaiming, 'Jesus reigns!' Now is the time for the church to arise and proclaim him 'Jesus, Saviour, Redeemer and Lord'. (Repeat)
