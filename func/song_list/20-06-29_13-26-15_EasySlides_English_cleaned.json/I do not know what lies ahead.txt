[Verse 1] 
I do not know what lies ahead, the way I cannot see; yet One stands near to be my guide, He’ll show the way to me:


[Verse 2] 
I know who holds the future, and He’ll guide me with His hand; with God things don’t just happen, everything by Him is planned. So as I face tomorrow, with its problems large and small, I’ll trust the God of miracles, give to Him my all.


[Verse 3] 
I do not know how many days of life are mine to spend; but One who knows and cares for me will keep me to the end:


[Verse 4] 
I know who holds the future, and He’ll guide me with His hand; with God things don’t just happen, everything by Him is planned. So as I face tomorrow, with its problems large and small, I’ll trust the God of miracles, give to Him my all.


[Verse 5] 
I do not know the course ahead, what joys and griefs are there; but One is near who fully knows, I’ll trust His loving care:


[Verse 6] 
I know who holds the future, and He’ll guide me with His hand; with God things don’t just happen, everything by Him is planned. So as I face tomorrow, with its problems large and small, I’ll trust the God of miracles, give to Him my all.
