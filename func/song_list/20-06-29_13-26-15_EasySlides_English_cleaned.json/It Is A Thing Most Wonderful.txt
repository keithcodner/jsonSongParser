[Verse 1] 
It is a thing most wonderful, Almost too wonderful to be, That God's own Son should come from heaven And die to save a child like me.


[Verse 2] 
And yet I know that it is true; He came to this poor world below, And wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died, Only because He loved us so.


[Verse 3] 
I cannot tell how He could love A child so weak and full of sin; His love must be most wonderful, If He could die my love to win.


[Verse 4] 
It is most wonderful to know His love for me so free and sure; But 'tis more wonderful to see My love for Him so faint and poor.


[Verse 5] 
And yet I want to love Thee, Lord; O light the flame within my heart, And I will love Thee more and more, Until I see Thee as Thou art.
