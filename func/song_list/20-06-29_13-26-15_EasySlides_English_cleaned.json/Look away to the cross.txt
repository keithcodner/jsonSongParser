[Verse 1] 
Look away to the cross of the Crucified One, where he purchased salvation for you; when he laid down his life, and completed the work that the Father had sent him to do.


[Verse 2] 
Room at the cross, there is room at the cross, and a welcome that all may receive; there is room at the cross of the Crucified One, and redemption for all who believe.


[Verse 3] 
Look away to the cross of the Crucified One, to the cross where he suffer'd and bled; and today he invites you to come if you will, and be cleansed in the blood that he shed.


[Verse 4] 
Room at the cross, there is room at the cross, and a welcome that all may receive; there is room at the cross of the Crucified One, and redemption for all who believe.


[Verse 5] 
Look away to the cross of the Crucified One, where the winepress alone he hath trod; where he cried in his anguish, 'Tis finish'd, 'tis done!' And commended his Spirit to God.


[Verse 6] 
Room at the cross, there is room at the cross, and a welcome that all may receive; there is room at the cross of the Crucified One, and redemption for all who believe.


[Verse 7] 
There is life at the cross of the Crucified One, and its hope is abiding and sure; for the rapture that flows from the love he bestows shall for ever and ever endure.


[Verse 8] 
Room at the cross, there is room at the cross, and a welcome that all may receive; there is room at the cross of the Crucified One, and redemption for all who believe.
