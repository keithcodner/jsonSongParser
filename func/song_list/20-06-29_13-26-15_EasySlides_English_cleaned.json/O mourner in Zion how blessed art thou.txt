[Verse 1] 
O mourner in Zion, how blessed art thou, for Jesus is waiting to comfort thee now; fear not to rely on the word of thy God;


[Verse 2] 
step out on the promise, step out on the promise, step out on the promise, get under the blood.


[Verse 3] 
O ye that are hungry and thirsty, rejoice! For ye shall be filled; do you hear that sweet voice, inviting you now to the banquet of God?


[Verse 4] 
Who sighs for a heart from iniquity free? O, poor troubled soul! There’s a promise for thee; there’s rest, weary one, in the bosom of God;


[Verse 5] 
The promise can’t save, though the promise is true; ‘tis the blood we get under that cleanses us through; it cleanses me now, hallelujah to God!


[Verse 6] 
I rest on the promise, I rest on the promise, I rest on the promise, I’m under the blood.
