[Verse 1] 
Wash me, O Lamb of God, wash me from sin! By Thine atoning blood, oh, make me clean! Purge me from every stain, let me Thine image gain, in love and mercy reign o'er all within.


[Verse 2] 
Wash me, O Lamb of God, wash me from sin! I long to be like Thee, all pure within. Now let the crimson tide, shed from Thy wounded side, be to my heart applied, and make me clean.


[Verse 3] 
Wash me, O Lamb of God, wash me from sin! I will not, cannot, rest till pure within. All human skill is vain, but Thou canst cleanse each stain till not a spot remain, made wholly clean.


[Verse 4] 
Wash me, O Lamb of God, wash me from sin! By faith Thy cleansing blood now makes me clean. So near art Thou to me, so sweet my rest in Thee, oh, blessed purity, saved, saved from sin!


[Verse 5] 
Wash me, O Lamb of God, wash me from sin! Thou while I trust in Thee, wilt keep me clean. Each day to Thee I bring heart, life, yea, everything; saved, while to Thee I cling, saved from all sin!
