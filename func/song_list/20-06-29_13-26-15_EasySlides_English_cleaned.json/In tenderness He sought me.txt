[Verse 1] 
In tenderness He sought me, weary and sick with sin, and on His shoulders brought me back to His fold again; while angels in His presence sang until the courts of heaven rang.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold, wondrous grace, that brought me to the fold!


[Verse 3] 
He washed the bleeding sin-wounds, and poured in oil and wine; He whispered to assure me, “I’ve found thee, thou art Mine.” I never heard a sweeter voice; it made my aching heart rejoice.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold, wondrous grace, that brought me to the fold!


[Verse 5] 
He pointed to the nail-prints, for me His blood was shed, a mocking crown so thorny was placed upon His head; I wondered what He saw in me, to suffer such deep agony.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold, wondrous grace, that brought me to the fold!


[Verse 7] 
I’m sitting in His presence, the sunshine of His face, while with adoring wonder His blessings I retrace. It seems as if eternal days are far too short to sound His praise.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold, wondrous grace, that brought me to the fold!


[Verse 9] 
So, while the hours are passing, all now is perfect rest; I’m waiting for the morning, the brightest and the best, when He will call us to His side, to be with Him, His spotless bride.


[Verse 10] 
Oh, the love that sought me! Oh, the blood that bought me! Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold, wondrous grace, that brought me to the fold!
