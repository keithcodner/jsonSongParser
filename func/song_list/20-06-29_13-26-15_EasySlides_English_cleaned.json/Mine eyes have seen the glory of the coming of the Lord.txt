[Verse 1] 
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible, swift sword: our God is marching on.


[Verse 2] 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah Our God is marching on.


[Verse 3] 
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgement-seat: oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! our God is marching on.


[Verse 4] 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah Our God is marching on.


[Verse 5] 
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea, with a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me: as He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free, while God is marching on.


[Verse 6] 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah Our God is marching on.
