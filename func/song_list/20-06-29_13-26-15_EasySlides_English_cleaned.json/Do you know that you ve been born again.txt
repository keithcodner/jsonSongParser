[Verse 1] 
Do you know that you've been born again? Do you know that you've been born again? Does the Spirit dwell within, bearing witness that you've been cleansed from ev'ry sin and stain? Are you ready if the Lord should come, Or today your soul should claim? Can you face eternal years free from doubt and dread and fears? Do you know, know, know, that you've been born again?


[Verse 2] 
Yes I know that I've been born again. Yes I know that I've been born again. For the Spirit dwells within, bearing witness that I've been cleansed from ev'ry sin and stain; I am ready if the Lord should come. Or today my soul should claim; I can face eternal years free from doubt and dread and fears. Yes, I know, know, know, that I've been born again!
