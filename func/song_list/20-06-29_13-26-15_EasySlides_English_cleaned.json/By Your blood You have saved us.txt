[Verse 1] 
By Your blood You have saved us, by Your blood you have feed us, by Your blood we can enter into Your holy place; by Your blood You have raised us, by Your blood, precious blood of the Lamb.   Father God in heaven, precious Lamb of God, we humbly bow before You and cry holy, holy. All of heavenâ€™s singing the song of the redeemed, giving glory to the Lamb.   By Your blood You have saved us, by Your blood you have feed us, by Your blood we can enter into Your holy place; by Your blood You have raised us, by Your blood, precious blood of the Lamb.
