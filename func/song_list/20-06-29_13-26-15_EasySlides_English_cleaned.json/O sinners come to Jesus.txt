[Verse 1] 
O sinners, come to Jesus! All other trust is vain; your every hope must fail you unless you’re born again. You need the cleansing fountain to purge your heart within, and purify your conscience from all the stains of sin.


[Verse 2] 
You need to come to Jesus and find in Him your rest, confiding in His goodness, reclining on His breast. You need the voice of Jesus to whisper “Go in peace!” To calm the inward tempest and bid the conflict cease.


[Verse 3] 
You need the power of Jesus to keep you day by day, to guard amid temptations and be your strength and stay. You need the love of Jesus: you need this faithful Friend, to cheer you and to bless you and guide you to the end.


[Verse 4]
