[Verse 1] 
My spirit, soul, and body, Jesus, I give to Thee, a consecrated offering, Thine evermore to be.


[Verse 2] 
My all is on the altar, Lord, I am all Thine own; oh, may my faith ne’er falter! Lord, keep me Thine alone.


[Verse 3] 
O Jesus, mighty Saviour, I trust in Thy great name; I look for Thy salvation, Thy promise now I claim.


[Verse 4] 
My all is on the altar, Lord, I am all Thine own; oh, may my faith ne’er falter! Lord, keep me Thine alone.


[Verse 5] 
Now, Lord, I yield my members, from sin’s dominion free, for warfare and for triumph, as weapons unto Thee.


[Verse 6] 
My all is on the altar, Lord, I am all Thine own; oh, may my faith ne’er falter! Lord, keep me Thine alone.


[Verse 7] 
I’m Thine, O blessed Jesus, washed in Thy precious blood, sealed by Thy Holy Spirit, a sacrifice to God.


[Verse 8] 
My all is on the altar, Lord, I am all Thine own; oh, may my faith ne’er falter! Lord, keep me Thine alone.
