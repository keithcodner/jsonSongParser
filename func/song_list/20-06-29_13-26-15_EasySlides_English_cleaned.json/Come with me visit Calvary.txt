[Verse 1] 
Come with me, visit Calvary, where our Redeemer died; His blood, it fills the fountain, ‘tis full, ‘tis deep, ‘tis wide. He died from sin to sever our hearts and lives complete; He saves and keeps for ever those lying at His feet.


[Verse 2] 
To the uttermost He saves, to the uttermost He saves, dare you now believe and His love receive, to the uttermost Jesus saves.


[Verse 3] 
I will surrender fully, and do His blessed will; His blood doth make me holy, His presence me doth fill. He’s saving, I’m believing, this blessing now I claim; His Spirit I’m receiving, my heart is in a flame.


[Verse 4] 
To the uttermost He saves, to the uttermost He saves, dare you now believe and His love receive, to the uttermost Jesus saves.


[Verse 5] 
I’ve wondrous peace through trusting, a well of joy within; this rest is everlasting, each day I triumph win. He gives me heavenly measure pressed down and running o’er, oh, what a priceless treasure, glory for evermore!


[Verse 6] 
To the uttermost He saves, to the uttermost He saves, dare you now believe and His love receive, to the uttermost Jesus saves.
