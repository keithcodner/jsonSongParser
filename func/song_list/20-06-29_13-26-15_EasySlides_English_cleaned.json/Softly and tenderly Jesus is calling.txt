[Verse 1] 
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me; see, on the portals Heâ€™s waiting and watching, watching for you and for me.


[Verse 2] 
Come home, come home; you who are weary, come home! Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, calling, O sinner, come home!


[Verse 3] 
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading, pleading for you and for me? Why should we linger and heed not His mercies, mercies for you and for me?


[Verse 4] 
Come home, come home; you who are weary, come home! Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, calling, O sinner, come home!


[Verse 5] 
Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing, passing from you and from me; shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming, coming for you and for me.


[Verse 6] 
Come home, come home; you who are weary, come home! Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, calling, O sinner, come home!


[Verse 7] 
Oh, for the wonderful love He has promised, promised for you and for me; though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon, pardon for you and for me.


[Verse 8] 
Come home, come home; you who are weary, come home! Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, calling, O sinner, come home!
