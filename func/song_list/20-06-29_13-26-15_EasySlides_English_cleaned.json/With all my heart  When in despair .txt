[Verse 1] 
With all my heart, I will put my trust in you. With all my heart, I will put my trust in you. I will lean on you, depend on you, I will look to the one I love with all my heart.


[Verse 2] 
When in despair, and no one else cares, storms all around, no friends can be found; you're always there, you're always there for me.


[Verse 3] 
With all my heart, I will put my trust in you. With all my heart, I will put my trust in you. I will lean on you, depend on you, I will look to the one I love with all my heart.


[Verse 4] 
Nothing compares to your faithfulness, no greater love in earth or above: so I'll declare, my heart is safe in your arms. 


[Verse 5] 
With all my heart, I will put my trust in you. With all my heart, I will put my trust in you. I will lean on you, depend on you, I will look to the one I love with all my heart.
