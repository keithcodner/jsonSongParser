[Verse 1] 
A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; our helper He amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing. For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe; His craft and power are great, and, armed with cruel hate, on earth is not His equal.


[Verse 2] 
With force of arms we nothing can, full soon were we down ridden; but for us fights the proper Man whom God Himself has bidden. Ask ye: Who is this same? Christ Jesus is His name, the Lord Sabaoth’s Son; He, and no other one, shall conquer in the battle.


[Verse 3] 
And were this world all devils o’er, and watching to devour us, we lay it not to heart so sore; not they can overpower us. And let the prince of ill look grim as e’er he will, he harms us not a whit; for why? His doom is writ; a word shall quickly slay him.


[Verse 4] 
God’s word, for all their craft and force, one moment will not linger, but, spite of hell, shall have its course; ‘tis written by His finger. And though they take our life, goods, honour, children, wife, yet is their profit small; these things shall vanish all, the city of God remaineth.
