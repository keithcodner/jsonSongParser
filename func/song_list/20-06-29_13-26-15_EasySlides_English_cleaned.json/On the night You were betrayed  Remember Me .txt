[Verse 1] 
On the night You were betrayed, You took the bread, After giving thanks, You broke it and said, This is My body, broken for you, And as you eat it, remember Me, This is My body, broken for you, And as you eat it, remember Me.


[Verse 2] 
On the night You were betrayed, You held the cup, After giving thanks, You lifted it up, This is My blood, poured out for you, And as you drink it, remember me, This is My blood, poured out for you, And as you drink it, remember Me.


[Verse 3] 
So we thank You for the wine, And for the bread, For we see the life You gave, And the blood You shed. And we remember, Your wondrous love, You gave Your body, You shed Your blood. And we remember, Your wondrous love You gave Your body, You shed Your blood.


[Verse 4] 
Yes we remember, Your wondrous love, You gave Your body, You shed Your blood, Yes we remember, Your wondrous love, You gave Your body, You shed Your blood.
