[Verse 1] 
This is My body, broken for you, bringing you wholeness, making you free. Take it and eat it, and when you do, do it in love for Me.


[Verse 2] 
This is My blood poured out for you, bringing forgiveness, making you free. Take it and drink it, and when you do, do it in love for Me.


[Verse 3] 
Back to My father soon I shall go. Do not forget Me; then you will see I am still with you, and you will know you're very close to Me.


[Verse 4] 
Filled with My Spirit, how you will grow! You are My branches; I am the tree. If you are faithful, others will know you are alive in Me.


[Verse 5] 
Love one another - I have loved you, and I have shown you how to be free; serve one another, and when you do, do it in love for Me.
