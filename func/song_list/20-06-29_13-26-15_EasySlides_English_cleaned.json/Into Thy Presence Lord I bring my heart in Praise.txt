[Verse 1] 
Into Thy presence Lord, I bring my heart in praise I give my life to Thee, My hands I raise And as I worship Thee, I feel you close to me Lord make my eyes to see Thee face to face


[Verse 2] 
Within Thy Presence Lord, I bow my heart in praise I give my song to Thee, the song you gave For on the cross for me, you poured out all so free And I now worship Thee, My Lord and King
