[Verse 1] 
He has brought us this far by His grace He has led us by fire and by cloud He will bring us to Zion to look on His face O blessed, O blessed be God


[Verse 2] 
Blessed be God, Blessed be God Blessed, O blessed be God


[Verse 3] 
He has sheltered us under His wings And He planned every path that we've trod To bring us to Zion, His praises to sing O blessed, O blessed be God


[Verse 4] 
Blessed be God, Blessed be God Blessed, O blessed be God
