[Verse 1] 
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak in living echoes of Thy tone; as Thou hast sought, so let me seek Thy erring children lost and lone.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead the wandering and the wavering feet; oh, feed me, Lord, that I may feed Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, strengthen me, that, while I stand firm on the Rock and strong in Thee, I may stretch out a loving hand to wrestlers with the troubled sea.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach the precious things Thou dost impart, and wing my words that they may reach the hidden depths of many a heart.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, give Thine own sweet rest to me, that I may speak with soothing power a word in season, as from Thee, to weary ones in needful hour.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, fill me with Thy fullness, Lord, until my very heart o'erflow in kindling thought and glowing word, Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.


[Verse 7] 
Oh, use me, Lord, use even me, just as Thou wilt, and when and where; until Thy blessed face I see, Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
