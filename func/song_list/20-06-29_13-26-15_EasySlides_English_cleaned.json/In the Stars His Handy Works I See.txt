[Verse 1] 
In the stars His handiwork I see On the winds He speaks of majesty Though He ruleth over land and sea What is that to me I will celebrate nativity For it has its place in history Sure He came to set His people free What is that to me


[Verse 2] 
Till one day I met Him face to face And I sought the wonder of His grace Then I knew that He was more than Just a God who didn't care That lived away up there, and Now He walks beside me day by day Ever watching o'er me lest I stray Helping me to find that narrow way He's everything to me
