[Verse 1] 
Jesus hath died and hath risen again, pardon and peace to bestow; fully I trust Him; from sin’s guilty stain Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus saves me now! Jesus saves me now! Yes, Jesus saves me all the time, Jesus saves me now!


[Verse 3] 
Sin’s condemnation is over and gone, Jesus alone knoweth how; life and salvation my soul hath put on; Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus is stronger than Satan and sin, Satan to Jesus must bow, therefore I triumph without and within; Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 5] 
Sorrow and pain may beset me about, nothing can darken my brow; battling in faith I can joyfully shout: Jesus saves me now.
