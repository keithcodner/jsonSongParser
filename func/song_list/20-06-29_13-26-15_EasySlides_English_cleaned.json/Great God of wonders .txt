[Verse 1] 
Great God of wonders! all thy ways are worthy of thyself divine; and the bright glories of thy grace among thine other wonders shine:


[Verse 2] 
Who is a pard'ning God like thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?


[Verse 3] 
Pardon from an offended God! Pardon for sins of deepest dye! Pardon bestowed through Jesus' blood! Pardon that brings the rebel nigh!


[Verse 4] 
Who is a pard'ning God like thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?


[Verse 5] 
O may this glorious, matchless love, this God-like miracle of grace, teach mortal tongues, like those above, to raise this song of lofty praise: 


[Verse 6] 
Who is a pard'ning God like thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?
