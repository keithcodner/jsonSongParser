[Verse 1] 
Is your life a channel of blessing? Is the love of God flowing through you? Are you telling the lost of the Saviour? Are you ready His service to do?


[Verse 2] 
Make me a channel of blessing today, make me a channel of blessing, I pray: my life possessing, my service blessing, make me a channel of blessing today.


[Verse 3] 
Is your life a channel of blessing? Are you burdened for those that are lost? Have you urged upon those who are straying, the Saviour who died on the cross?


[Verse 4] 
Make me a channel of blessing today, make me a channel of blessing, I pray: my life possessing, my service blessing, make me a channel of blessing today.


[Verse 5] 
Is your life a channel of blessing? Is it daily telling for Him? Have you spoken the word of salvation To those who are dying in sin?


[Verse 6] 
Make me a channel of blessing today, make me a channel of blessing, I pray: my life possessing, my service blessing, make me a channel of blessing today.


[Verse 7] 
We cannot be channels of blessing if our lives are not free from all sin; we will barriers be and a hindrance to those we are trying to win.


[Verse 8] 
Make me a channel of blessing today, make me a channel of blessing, I pray: my life possessing, my service blessing, make me a channel of blessing today.
