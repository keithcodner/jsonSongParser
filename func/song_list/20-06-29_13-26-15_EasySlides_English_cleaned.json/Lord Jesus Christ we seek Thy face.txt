[Verse 1] 
Lord Jesus Christ, we seek thy face within the veil we bow the knee. Oh, let thy glory fill the place, and bless us while we wait on thee.


[Verse 2] 
We thank thee for the precious blood that purged our sins and brought us nigh. All cleansed and sanctified to God, thy holy name to magnify.


[Verse 3] 
The brow that once with thorns was bound, thy hands, thy side we fain would see; draw near, Lord Jesus, glory crowned, and bless us while we wait on thee.
