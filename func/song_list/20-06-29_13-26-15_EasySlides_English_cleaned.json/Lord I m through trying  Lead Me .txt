[Verse 1] 
Lord, I'm through trying to take the upper hand. I never knew, but now I think I understand. On my own, wanting it in black and white. On my knees, things are in a different light. 


[Verse 2] 
Lead me along the path. Lead me along the winding way. I trust enough to never need the why if You'll take me to the where. Lead me along the path. Lead me along the winding way. I don't know what's around the corner Lord, but I know that You'll be there. 


[Verse 3] 
Lord I'm through wondering what lies in store. It's up to You, You've never let me down before. Bubbles burst when I'm the one who knows what's best. When You're first, I'm never gonna second-guess. 


[Verse 4] 
Helpless alone Blest be the ties. My point of view points to You. You've become my eyes.
