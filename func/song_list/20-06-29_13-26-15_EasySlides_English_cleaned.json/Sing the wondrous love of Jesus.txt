[Verse 1] 
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, sing His mercy and His grace; in the mansions, bright and blessed, He’ll prepare for us a place.


[Verse 2] 
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be! When all see Jesus, we’ll sing and shout the victory.


[Verse 3] 
While we walk the pilgrim pathway, clouds will over-spread the sky; but when travelling days are over, not a shadow, not a sigh.


[Verse 4] 
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be! When all see Jesus, we’ll sing and shout the victory.


[Verse 5] 
Let us, then, be true and faithful, trusting, serving every day; just one glimpse of Him in glory, will the toils of life repay.


[Verse 6] 
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be! When all see Jesus, we’ll sing and shout the victory.


[Verse 7] 
Onward to the prize before us! Soon His beauty we’ll behold; soon the pearly gates will open, we shall tread the streets of gold.


[Verse 8] 
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be! When all see Jesus, we’ll sing and shout the victory.
