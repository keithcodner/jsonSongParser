[Verse 1] 
When spirits separate, Hurt and pain will follow But amidst look up to Him For He has taken control


[Verse 2] 
A time to stay, A time to go, We may never knowâ€¦ But do His will Follow Him In Heaven we shall meet again


[Verse 3] 
He has called you to leave here Be not afraid.. A glorious mission awaits You Cast light into the dark


[Verse 4] 
Days will come Days will go Days will come and go. One glorious day in Heaven We will meet again!
