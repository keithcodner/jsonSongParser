[Verse 1] 
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! He loved me ere I knew Him; He drew me with the cords of love, and thus He bound me to Him. And round my heart still closely twine those ties which nought can sever, for I am His, and He is mine, for ever and for ever!


[Verse 2] 
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! He bled, He died to save me; and not alone the gift of life, but His own self He gave me, nought that I have my own I call, I hold it for the Giver: my heart, my strength, my life, my all are His, and His for ever!


[Verse 3] 
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! All power to Him is given to guard me on my onward course, and bring me safe to heaven. The eternal glories gleam afar to nerve my faint endeavour! So now to watch! to work! to war! And then to rest for ever!


[Verse 4] 
I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! So kind, and true, and tender; so wise a Counsellor and Guide, so mighty a Defender! From Him who loves me now so well, what power my soul can sever? Shall life or death? or earth or hell? No! I am His for ever!
