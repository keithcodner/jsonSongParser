[Verse 1] 
I don't know about tomorrow, I just live from day to day. I don't borrow from it's sunshine, For it's skies may turn to gray. I don't worry o'er the future, For I know what Jesus said, And today I'll walk beside Him, For He knows what is ahead. 


[Verse 2] 
Many things about tomorrow, I don't seem to understand; But I know Who holds tomorrow, And I know Who holds my hand.


[Verse 3] 
Ev'ry step is getting brighter, As the golden stairs I climb; Ev'ry burden's getting lighter; Ev'ry cloud is silver lined. There the sun is always shining, There no tear will dim the eyes, At the ending of the rainbow, Where the mountains touch the sky.


[Verse 4] 
Many things about tomorrow, I don't seem to understand; But I know Who holds tomorrow, And I know Who holds my hand.


[Verse 5] 
I don't know about tomorrow, It may bring me poverty; But the One Who feeds the sparrow, Is the One Who stands by me. And the path that be my portion, May be through the flame or flood, But His presence goes before me, And I'm covered with His blood. 


[Verse 6] 
Many things about tomorrow, I don't seem to understand; But I know Who holds tomorrow, And I know Who holds my hand.
