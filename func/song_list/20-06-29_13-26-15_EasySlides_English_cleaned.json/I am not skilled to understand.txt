[Verse 1] 
I am not skilled to understand what God hath willed, what God hath planned; I only know at His right hand stands One who is my Saviour.


[Verse 2] 
I take Him at His word indeed; “Christ died for sinners,” this I read; for in my heart I find a need of Him to be my Saviour.


[Verse 3] 
That He should leave His place on high, and come for sinful man to die, you count it strange? so once did I before I knew my Saviour!


[Verse 4] 
And oh, that He fulfilled may see the travail of His soul in me, and with His work contented be, as I with my dear Saviour!


[Verse 5] 
Yea, living, dying, let me bring my strength, my solace, from this spring, that He who lives to be my King once died to be my Saviour.
