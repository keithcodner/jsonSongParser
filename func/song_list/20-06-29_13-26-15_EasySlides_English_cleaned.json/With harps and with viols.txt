[Verse 1] 
With harps and with viols there stands a great throng in the presence of Jesus, and sings this new song:


[Verse 2] 
Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin, unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.


[Verse 3] 
All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight; now arrayed in pure garments, in praise they unite.


[Verse 4] 
Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin, unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.


[Verse 5] 
He maketh the rebel a priest and a king, He hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing.


[Verse 6] 
Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin, unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.


[Verse 7] 
How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been, if He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin.


[Verse 8] 
Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin, unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.


[Verse 9] 
Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring, so that others, believing, this new song shall sing.


[Verse 10] 
Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin, unto Him be the glory for ever! Amen.
