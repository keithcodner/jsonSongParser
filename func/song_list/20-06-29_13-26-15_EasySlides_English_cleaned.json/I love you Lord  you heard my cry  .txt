[Verse 1] 
I love you, Lord because you heard my cry for mercy. I love you, Lord because you heard my voice and answered me. Though the fears of death surround me I won't be afraid if you are there. When I call your name you hear me, when I am brought low I find you near. It is to you I lift up my eyes, only you.


[Verse 2] 
What can I give for all you've done for me so freely? I will make known your overwhelming love that rescued me. I'll complete all I have promised in the presence of your people here, calling on your name for ever, living always in your house of prayer. It is to you I lift up my eyes, only you. It is to you I lift up my eyes, only you.
