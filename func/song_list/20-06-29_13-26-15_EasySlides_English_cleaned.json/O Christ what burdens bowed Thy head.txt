[Verse 1] 
O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head! Our load was laid on Thee; Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead, didst bear all ill for me. A victim led, Thy blood was shed; now there’s no load for me.


[Verse 2] 
Death and the curse were in our cup: O Christ, ‘twas full for Thee! But Thou hast drained the last dark drop, ‘tis empty now for me: that bitter cup, love drank it up: now blessing’s draught for me.


[Verse 3] 
The tempest’s awful voice was heard, O Christ, it broke on Thee! Thy open bosom was my ward, it braved the storm for me. Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred, now cloudless peace for me.


[Verse 4] 
For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died, and I have died in Thee: Thou’rt risen, my bands are all untied; and now Thou livest in me: when purified, made white and tried, Thy glory then for me!
