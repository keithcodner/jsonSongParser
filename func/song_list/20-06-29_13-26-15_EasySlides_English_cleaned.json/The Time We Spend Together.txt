[Verse 1] 
The time we spend together What a joy to remember The love we share together Is the love from above The time we spend together I will ever remember It's the love of God, That's what love's based on I will praise Him evermore


[Verse 2] 
The time we sing together Is the time that you smile The joy we share together Is the joy from the Lord The time we departed Is the time that we find our love It's the love of God That's what love's based on I will praise Him evermore
