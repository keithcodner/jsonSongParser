[Verse 1] 
“Take up thy cross and follow Me,” I heard my Master say; “I gave My life to ransom thee surrender your all today.”


[Verse 2] 
Wherever He leads I’ll go, wherever He leads I’ll go; I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so, wherever He leads I’ll go.


[Verse 3] 
He drew me closer to His side, I sought His will to know; and in that will I now abide wherever He leads I’ll go.


[Verse 4] 
Wherever He leads I’ll go, wherever He leads I’ll go; I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so, wherever He leads I’ll go.


[Verse 5] 
It may be through the shadows dim or o’er the stormy sea; I take my cross and follow Him wherever He leadeth me.


[Verse 6] 
Wherever He leads I’ll go, wherever He leads I’ll go; I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so, wherever He leads I’ll go.


[Verse 7] 
My heart, my life, my all I bring to Christ who loves me so; He is my Master, Lord, and King wherever He leads I’ll go.


[Verse 8] 
Wherever He leads I’ll go, wherever He leads I’ll go; I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so, wherever He leads I’ll go.
