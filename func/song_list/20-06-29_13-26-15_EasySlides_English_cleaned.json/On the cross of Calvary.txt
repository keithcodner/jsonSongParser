[Verse 1] 
On the cross of Calvary, Jesus died for you and me, there He shed His precious blood, that from sin we might be free. Oh, the cleansing stream doth flow, and it washes white as snow; it was for me that Jesus died, on the cross of Calvary.


[Verse 2] 
Clouds and darkness veiled the sky when the Lord was crucified, “It is finished,” was His cry, when He bowed His head, and died, it is finished! - yes, indeed, all the world may now go free. It was for this that Jesus died, on the cross of Calvary.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, what wondrous, wondrous love, brought me down at Jesus’ feet! Oh, such wondrous dying love, asks a sacrifice complete. Here I give myself to Thee, soul and body, Thine to be, it was for me Thy blood was shed, on the cross of Calvary.


[Verse 4] 
Take me, Lord, and seal me Thine, wholly Thine, for evermore, sweet assurance, Thou art mine, and the night of death is o’er. Cleanse, oh, cleanse my heart from sin, make and keep me pure within! It was for this Thy blood was shed on the cross of Calvary.
