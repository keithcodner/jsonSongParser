[Verse 1] 
How I long to sing Your praise Worship You Lord in Your presence Father of mercy and grace Come and abide in me


[Verse 2] 
Jesus Lord of glory Brings me to my knees Crush the 'I' Lord Crush the 'pride' Be glorified in me


[Verse 3] 
I will fly like an eagle Soaring on the breezes of Your love Hear Your whisper Draw me closer to You Fill me Lord with Holy fire You perfect will, my heart's desire And I will fly, Lord And I will soar like an eagle Like an eagle
