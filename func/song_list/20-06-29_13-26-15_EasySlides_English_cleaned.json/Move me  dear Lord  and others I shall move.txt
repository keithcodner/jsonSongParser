[Verse 1] 
Move me, dear Lord, and others I shall move to do Thy will; mould Thou this life into a vessel fair Thyself to fill; no charm with which to draw do I possess, in Thee I find the secret of success.


[Verse 2] 
O touch these yielded lips and through them pour Thy living thought; I would not give to hungry souls the words that man hath taught; shall they who seek the bread a stone receive? It is God's Word alone that can relieve.


[Verse 3] 
How wonderful a channel thus to be, to those forlorn, a messenger of peace and joy and hope, to them that mourn; O grant that I Thy risen life may share, the virtue of Thy name to others bear.


[Verse 4] 
Under the anointing daily let me live, a priest and king; relying not on fleshly energy Thy smile to win; a simple soul in contact with my Lord, in whom all fullness is forever stored.


[Verse 5] 
O teach me, Lord, henceforth with Thee to walk in union deep; whilst tending other souls not to neglect my own to keep; a separated soul unto the One whose grace and love for me so much have done.
