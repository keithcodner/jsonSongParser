[Verse 1] 
Come, Saviour Jesus, from above, assist me with Thy heavenly grace, empty my heart of earthly love, and for Thyself prepare the place.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, let Thy sacred presence fill, and set my longing spirit free to have, henceforth, no other will, but day and night to follow Thee.


[Verse 3] 
While in this region here below, no other good will I pursue; I bid this world of noise and show, with all its glittering snares, adieu.


[Verse 4] 
Wealth, honour, pleasure, and what else this short-enduring world can give, tempt as ye will, my soul repels, to Christ alone resolved to live.


[Verse 5] 
Henceforth let no profane delight divide this consecrated soul; possess it Thou, who hast the right, as Lord and Master of the whole.


[Verse 6] 
Thee would I love, and Thee alone, with pure delight and inward bliss; to know Thou takest me for Thine own; oh, what a happiness is this!
