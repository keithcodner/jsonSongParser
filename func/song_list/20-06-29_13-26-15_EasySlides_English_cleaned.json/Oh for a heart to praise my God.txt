[Verse 1] 
Oh for a heart to praise my God, a heart from sin set free, a heart that always feels the blood so freely shed for me;


[Verse 2] 
A heart resigned, submissive, meek, my great Redeemerâ€™s throne, where only Christ is heard to speak, where Jesus reigns alone!


[Verse 3] 
A humble, lowly, contrite heart, believing, true, and clean, which neither life nor death can part from Him that dwells within:


[Verse 4] 
A heart in every thought renewed, and filled with love divine, perfect, and right, and pure, and good, a copy, Lord, of Thine!


[Verse 5] 
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart; come quickly from above; write Thy new name upon my heart, Thy new, best name of Love.
