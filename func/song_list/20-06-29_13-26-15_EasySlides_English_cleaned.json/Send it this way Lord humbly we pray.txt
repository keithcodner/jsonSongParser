[Verse 1] 
Send it this way, Lord, humbly we pray! A mighty revival, send it this way! Remove every hindrance, my spirit set free, that I in revival Thy channel may be.   Coming this way, yes, coming this way, a mighty revival is coming this way! Keep on believing, trust and obey; a mighty revival is coming this way.
