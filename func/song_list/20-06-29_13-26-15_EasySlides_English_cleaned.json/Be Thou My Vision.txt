[Verse 1] 
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart; Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art; Thou my best thought, by day or by night, Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.


[Verse 2] 
Be thou my wisdom, Thou my true Word; I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord; Thou my great Father, I Thy true son; Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.


[Verse 3] 
Be Thou my battle-shield, sword for the fight; Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight. Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower: Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.


[Verse 4] 
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise, Thou mine inheritance, now and always: Thou and Thou only, first in my heart, High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.


[Verse 5] 
High King of heaven, after victory won, May I reach heavenâ€™s joy, O bright heaven's Sun! Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
