[Verse 1] 
Oh, safe to the Rock that is higher than I, my soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly; so sinful, so weary, thine, thine would I be; thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.


[Verse 2] 
Hiding in thee, hiding in thee, thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.


[Verse 3] 
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour, in times when temptation casts o'er me its power; in the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea, thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.


[Verse 4] 
Hiding in thee, hiding in thee, thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.


[Verse 5] 
How oft in the conflict when press'd by the foe, I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe; how often when trails like sea billows roll, have I hidden in thee, O thou Rock of my soul.


[Verse 6] 
Hiding in thee, hiding in thee, thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in thee.
