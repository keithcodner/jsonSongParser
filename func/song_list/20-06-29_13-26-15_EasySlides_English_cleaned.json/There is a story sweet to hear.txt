[Verse 1] 
There is a story sweet to hear, I love to tell it too; it fills my heart with hope and cheer, ‘tis old yet ever new.


[Verse 2] 
‘tis old, yet ever new, ‘tis old, yet ever new; I know, I feel ‘tis true; ‘tis old, yet ever new.


[Verse 3] 
It tells me God the Son came down from glory’s throne to die, that I might live and wear a crown, and reign with Him on high.


[Verse 4] 
‘tis old, yet ever new, ‘tis old, yet ever new; I know, I feel ‘tis true; ‘tis old, yet ever new.


[Verse 5] 
It says He bore the Cross for me, and suffered in my place, that I from sin might ransomed be, and praise Him for His grace.


[Verse 6] 
‘tis old, yet ever new, ‘tis old, yet ever new; I know, I feel ‘tis true; ‘tis old, yet ever new.


[Verse 7] 
Oh wondrous love, so great, so vast, so boundless and so free! Lord, at Thy feet myself I cast; my all I give to Thee!


[Verse 8] 
‘tis old, yet ever new, ‘tis old, yet ever new; I know, I feel ‘tis true; ‘tis old, yet ever new.
