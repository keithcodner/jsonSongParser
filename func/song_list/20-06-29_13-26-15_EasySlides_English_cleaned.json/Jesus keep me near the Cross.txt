[Verse 1] 
Jesus, keep me near the Cross! There a precious fountain, free to all, a healing stream flows from Calvary’s mountain.


[Verse 2] 
In the Cross, in the Cross be my glory ever, till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river!


[Verse 3] 
Near the Cross, a trembling soul, love and mercy found me; there the bright and morning star shed its beams around me.


[Verse 4] 
In the Cross, in the Cross be my glory ever, till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river!


[Verse 5] 
Near the Cross! - O Lamb of God, bring its scenes before me! Help me walk from day to day with its shadow o’er me.


[Verse 6] 
In the Cross, in the Cross be my glory ever, till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river!


[Verse 7] 
Near the Cross I’ll watch and wait, hoping, trusting ever, till I reach the golden strand, just beyond the river.


[Verse 8] 
In the Cross, in the Cross be my glory ever, till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river!
