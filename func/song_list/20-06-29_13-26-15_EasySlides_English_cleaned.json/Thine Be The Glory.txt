[Verse 1] 
Thine be the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won. Angels in bright raiment Rolled the stone away, Kept the folded grave-clothes Where Thy body lay.


[Verse 2] 
Thine be the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won!


[Verse 3] 
Lo, Jesus meets us, Risen from the tomb! Lovingly He greets us, Scatters fear and gloom. Let the church with gladness Hymns of triumph sing, For her Lord now liveth, Death hath lost its sting.


[Verse 4] 
Thine be the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won!


[Verse 5] 
No more we doubt Thee, Glorious Prince of life; Life is naught without Thee: Aid us in our strife; Make us more than conquerors, Through Thy deathless love; Lead us in Thy triumph To Thy home above.


[Verse 6] 
Thine be the glory, Risen, conquering Son; Endless is the victory Thou o'er death hast won!
