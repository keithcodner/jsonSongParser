[Verse 1] 
There's a river of life flowing out from me Makes the lame to walk and the blind to see Opens prison doors, sets the captives free There's a river of life flowing out from me   Spring up O well, within my soul Spring up O well, and make me whole Spring up O well, and give to me That life abundantly
