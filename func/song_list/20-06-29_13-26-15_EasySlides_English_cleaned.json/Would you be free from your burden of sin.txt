[Verse 1] 
Would you be free from your burden of sin? There’s power in the blood, power in the blood, Would you o’er evil a victory win? There’s wonderful power in the blood.


[Verse 2] 
There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the blood of the Lamb; There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the precious blood of the Lamb.


[Verse 3] 
Would you be free from your passion and pride? Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide!


[Verse 4] 
There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the blood of the Lamb; There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the precious blood of the Lamb.


[Verse 5] 
Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow? Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow.


[Verse 6] 
There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the blood of the Lamb; There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the precious blood of the Lamb.


[Verse 7] 
Would you do service for Jesus your King? Would you live daily His praises to sing?


[Verse 8] 
There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the blood of the Lamb; There is power, power, wonder- working power, in the precious blood of the Lamb.
