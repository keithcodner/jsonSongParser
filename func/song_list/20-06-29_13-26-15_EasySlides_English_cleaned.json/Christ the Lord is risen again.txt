[Verse 1] 
Christ the Lord is ris'n again, Christ has broken ev'ry chain; hear the angel voices cry, singing evermore on high: alleluia!


[Verse 2] 
He who gave for us his life, who for us endured the strife, is our paschal lamb today; we too sing for joy and say: alleluia!


[Verse 3] 
He who bore all pain and loss comfortless upon the cross lives in glory now on high, pleads for us and hears our cry: alleluia!


[Verse 4] 
He who slumbered in the grave is exalted now to save; through the universe it rings that the Lamb is King of kings: alleluia!


[Verse 5] 
Now he bids us tell abroad how the lost may be restored, how the penitent forgiven, how we too may enter heaven: alleluia!


[Verse 6] 
Christ, our paschal lamb indeed, all your ransomed people feed! Take our sins and guilt away; let us sing by night and day: alleluia!
