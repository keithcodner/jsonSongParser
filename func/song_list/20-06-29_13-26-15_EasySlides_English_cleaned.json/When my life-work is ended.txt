[Verse 1] 
When my life-work is ended, and I cross the swelling tide, when the bright and glorious morning I shall see; I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side, and His smile will be the first to welcome me.


[Verse 2] 
I shall know Him, I shall know Him as redeemed by His side I shall stand, I shall know Him, I shall know Him by the print of the nails in His hand.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, the soul-thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face, and the lustre of His kindly beaming eye; how my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love, and grace that prepares me for a mansion in the sky.


[Verse 4] 
I shall know Him, I shall know Him as redeemed by His side I shall stand, I shall know Him, I shall know Him by the print of the nails in His hand.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they beckon me to come, and our parting at the river I recall; to the sweet vales of Eden they will sing my welcome home, but I long to meet my Saviour first of all.


[Verse 6] 
I shall know Him, I shall know Him as redeemed by His side I shall stand, I shall know Him, I shall know Him by the print of the nails in His hand.


[Verse 7] 
Through the gates to the city in a robe of spotless white, He will lead me where no tears shall ever fall; in the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight; but I long to meet my Saviour first of all.


[Verse 8] 
I shall know Him, I shall know Him as redeemed by His side I shall stand, I shall know Him, I shall know Him by the print of the nails in His hand.
