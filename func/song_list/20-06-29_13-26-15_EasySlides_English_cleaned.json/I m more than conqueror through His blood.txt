[Verse 1] 
I'm more than conqueror through His blood, Jesus saves me now; I rest beneath the shield of God, Jesus saves me now; I go a kingdom to obtain, I shall through Him the victory gain, Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 2] 
Before the battle lines are spread, before the boasting foe is dead, I win the fight though not begun, I'll trust and shout, still marching on, Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 3] 
I'll ask no more that I may see, His promise is enough for me, though foes be strong and walls be high, I'll shout, He gives the victory, Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 4] 
Why should I ask a sign from God? Can I not trust the precious blood? Strong in His word I meet the foe, and shouting, win without a blow, Jesus saves me now.


[Verse 5] 
Should Satan come like 'whelming waves, ere trials crush, my Father saves, He hides me till the storm is past, for me He tempers every blast, Jesus saves me now.
