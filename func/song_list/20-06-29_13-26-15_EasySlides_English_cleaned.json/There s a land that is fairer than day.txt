[Verse 1] 
There's a land that is fairer than day, and by faith we can see it afar, for the Father waits over the way, to prepare us a dwelling-place there.


[Verse 2] 
In the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore; by and by; in the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore.


[Verse 3] 
We shall sing on that beautiful shore the melodious songs of the blest, and our spirits shall sorrow no more not a sigh for the blessing of rest.


[Verse 4] 
In the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore; by and by; in the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore.


[Verse 5] 
To our bountiful Father above we will offer the tribute of praise, for the glorious gift of his love, and the blessings that hallow our days.


[Verse 6] 
In the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore; by and by; in the sweet by and by, in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore.
