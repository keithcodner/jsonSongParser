[Verse 1] 
Wonderful birth, to a manger He came, made in the likeness of man, to proclaim God’s boundless love for a world sick with sin, pleading with sinners to let Him come in.


[Verse 2] 
Wonderful name He bears, wonderful crown He wears, wonderful blessings His triumphs afford; wonderful Calvary, wonderful grace for me, wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!


[Verse 3] 
Wonderful life, full of service so free, friend to the poor and the needy was He; unfailing goodness on all He bestowed, undying faith in the vilest He showed.


[Verse 4] 
Wonderful name He bears, wonderful crown He wears, wonderful blessings His triumphs afford; wonderful Calvary, wonderful grace for me, wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!


[Verse 5] 
Wonderful death, for it meant not defeat, Calvary made His great mission complete, wrought our redemption, and when He arose, banished for ever the last of our foes.


[Verse 6] 
Wonderful name He bears, wonderful crown He wears, wonderful blessings His triumphs afford; wonderful Calvary, wonderful grace for me, wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!


[Verse 7] 
Wonderful hope, He is coming again, coming as King o’er the nations to reign; glorious promise, His word cannot fail, His righteous kingdom at last must prevail!


[Verse 8] 
Wonderful name He bears, wonderful crown He wears, wonderful blessings His triumphs afford; wonderful Calvary, wonderful grace for me, wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!
