[Verse 6] 
Then let us adore him, and praise his great love: to save us poor sinners he came from above.

[Verse 12] 
Then let us adore him, and praise his great love: to save us poor sinners he came from above.

[Verse 14] 
Then let us adore him, and praise his great love: to save us poor sinners he came from above.
