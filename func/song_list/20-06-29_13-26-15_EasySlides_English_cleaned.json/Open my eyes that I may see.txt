[Verse 1] 
Open my eyes that I may see glimpses of truth Thou hast for me; place in my hands the wonderful key that shall unclasp and set me free.


[Verse 2] 
Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see; open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit divine!


[Verse 3] 
Open my ears that I may hear voices of truth Thou sendest clear; and while the wave-notes fall on my ear, everything false will disappear.


[Verse 4] 
Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see; open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit divine!


[Verse 5] 
Open my mouth and let me bear tidings of mercy everywhere; open my heart and let me prepare love with Thy children thus to share.


[Verse 6] 
Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see; open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit divine!


[Verse 7] 
Open my mind, that I may read more of Thy love in word and deed: what shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead? Only for light from Thee I plead.


[Verse 8] 
Silently now I wait for Thee, ready, my God, Thy will to see; open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit divine!
