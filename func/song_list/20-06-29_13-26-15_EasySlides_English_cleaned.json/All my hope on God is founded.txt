[Verse 1] 
All my hope on God is founded; he doth still my trust renew, me through change and chance he guideth, only good and only true. God unknown, he alone calls my heart to be his own.


[Verse 2] 
Pride of man and earthly glory, sword and crown betray his trust; what with care and toil he buildeth, tower and temple, fall to dust. But God's pow'r, hour by hour, is my temple and my tower.


[Verse 3] 
God's great goodness aye endureth, deep his wisdom, passing thought: splendour, life, and light attend him, beauty springeth out of naught. Evermore from his store new-born worlds rise and adore.


[Verse 4] 
Daily doth th'almighty giver bounteous gifts on us bestow; his desire our soul delighteth, pleasure leads us where we go. Love doth stand at his hand; joy doth wait on his command.


[Verse 5] 
Still from man to God eternal sacrifice of praise be done, high above all praises praising for the gift of Christ his Son. Christ doth call one and all: ye who follow shall not fall.
