[Verse 1] 
Christmas is a time Christmas is a time to love Christmas is a time Christmas is a time Christmas is a time to love   We often start to worry And people get upset If things don't go alright on Christmas day What we should remember in all the push and shove Is Christmas is a time to love   Maybe things don't sound right Or look the way they should And maybe they're not perfectly in tune It really doesn't matter, let's keep our eyes above Cause Christmas is a time to love
