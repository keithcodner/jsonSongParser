[Verse 1] 
Above thine own ambitions here, another voice is sounding clear; it is the call of God to thee, “Oh, leave thine all and follow Me.”


[Verse 2] 
Go through with God, thy vows to pay, thy life upon the altar lay; the Holy Ghost will do the rest, and bring to thee God's very best!


[Verse 3] 
The call of God, it is so clear, but friendships call, and home is dear; ah, lonely was the path He trod; then wilt thou not go through with God?


[Verse 4] 
Go through with God, thy vows to pay, thy life upon the altar lay; the Holy Ghost will do the rest, and bring to thee God's very best!


[Verse 5] 
So soon Eternal Morn shall dawn, how fast the night is hastening on; so soon His lovely face to see, how sad to empty handed be!


[Verse 6] 
Go through with God, thy vows to pay, thy life upon the altar lay; the Holy Ghost will do the rest, and bring to thee God's very best!


[Verse 7] 
The price is high, severe the test, for those who would enjoy God's best; surrender all, then take the road, with those who will go through with God.


[Verse 8] 
Go through with God, thy vows to pay, thy life upon the altar lay; the Holy Ghost will do the rest, and bring to thee God's very best!
