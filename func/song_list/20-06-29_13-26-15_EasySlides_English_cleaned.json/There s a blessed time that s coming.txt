[Verse 1] 
There's a blessed time that's coming, coming soon, it may be evening, morning or at noon. There'll be a wedding of the Bride, united with the Groom. We shall see the King when he comes.


[Verse 2] 
We shall see the King, we shall see the King, we shall see the King when he comes. He is coming in pow'r, he'll hail the blessed hour. We shall see the King when he comes.


[Verse 3] 
Are you ready should the Saviour call today? Would Jesus say, 'Well done' or 'Go away'? He's building a home for the pure, the vile can never stay. We shall see the King when he comes.


[Verse 4] 
We shall see the King, we shall see the King, we shall see the King when he comes. He is coming in pow'r, he'll hail the blessed hour. We shall see the King when he comes.


[Verse 5] 
O my brother, are you ready for the call? We'll crown our Saviour King and Lord of all. All the kingdoms of this world shall soon before him fall. We shall see the King when he comes.


[Verse 6] 
We shall see the King, we shall see the King, we shall see the King when he comes. He is coming in pow'r, he'll hail the blessed hour. We shall see the King when he comes.
