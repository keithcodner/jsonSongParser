[Verse 1] 
My heart is fixed, eternal God, fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee, and my unchanging choice is made: Christ for me! He is my Prophet, Priest, and King, who did for me salvation bring; and while I’ve breath I mean to sing: Christ for me, Christ for me.


[Verse 2] 
Let others boast of heaps of gold, Christ for me, Christ for me. His riches never can be told, Christ for me. Their gold will waste and wear away, their honours perish in a day, my portion never can decay; Christ for me, Christ for me.


[Verse 3] 
At home, abroad, by night, by day, Christ for me, Christ for me, Where’er may lead my pilgrim way, Christ for me. Him first and last, Him all day long, my strength and shield, my fortress strong, this evermore my hope and song, Christ for me, Christ for me.


[Verse 4] 
Now who can sing my song and say - “Christ for me, Christ for me, my life and truth, my light and way Christ for me”? Then here’s my heart and here’s my hand, we’ll form a daring, happy band, and shout aloud throughout the land: Christ for me, Christ for me!
