[Verse 1] 
Come, O Thou Traveller unknown, whom still I hold, but cannot see! My company before is gone, and I am left alone with Thee; with Thee all night I mean to stay, and wrestle till the break of day.


[Verse 2] 
I need not tell Thee who I am, my misery and sin declare; Thyself hast called me by my name; look on Thy hands, and read it there: but who, I ask Thee, who art Thou? Tell me Thy name, and tell me now.


[Verse 3] 
In vain Thou strugglest to get free; I never will unloose my hold! Art Thou the Man that died for me? The secret of Thy love unfold: wrestling, I will not let Thee go, till I Thy name, Thy nature know.


[Verse 4] 
Yield to me now; for I am weak, but confident in self-despair; speak to my heart, in blessings speak, be conquered by my instant prayer; speak, or Thou never hence shalt move, and tell me if Thy name is Love.


[Verse 5] 
‘Tis Love! ‘tis Love! Thou diedst for me! I hear Thy whisper in my heart; the morning breaks, the shadows flee, pure, universal Love Thou art; to me, to all, Thy mercies move: Thy nature and Thy name is Love.


[Verse 6] 
I know Thee, Saviour, who Thou art, Jesus, the feeble sinner’s Friend; nor wilt Thou with the night depart, but stay and love me to the end; Thy mercies never shall remove: Thy nature and Thy name is Love.
