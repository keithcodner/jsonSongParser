[Verse 1] 
That man hath perfect blessedness who walketh not astray in counsel of ungodly men, nor stands in sinners’ way,


[Verse 2] 
nor sitteth in the scorner’s chair: but placeth his delight upon God’s law, and meditates on His law day and night.


[Verse 3] 
He shall be like a tree that grows near planted by a river, which in his season yields his fruit, and his leaf fadeth never:


[Verse 4] 
and all he doth shall prosper well. The wicked are not so; but like they are unto the chaff, which wind drives to and fro.


[Verse 5] 
In judgement therefore shall not stand such as ungodly are; nor in the assembly of the just shall wicked men appear.


[Verse 6] 
For why? The way of godly men unto the Lord is known: whereas the way of wicked men shall quite be overthrown.
