[Verse 1] 
O for a closer walk with God, A calm and heavenly frame, A light to shine upon the road That leads me to the Lamb.


[Verse 2] 
Where is the bless√®dness I knew When I first saw the Lord? Where is that soul-refreshing view Of Jesus and His word?


[Verse 3] 
What peaceful hours I once enjoyed! How sweet their memory still! But they have left an aching void The world can never fill.


[Verse 4] 
Return, O holy Dove! return, Sweet messenger of rest! I hate the sins that made Thee mourn, And drove Thee from my breast.


[Verse 5] 
The dearest idol I have known, Whate'er that idol be, Help me tear if from Thy throne, And worship only Thee.


[Verse 6] 
So shall my walk be close with God, Calm and serene my frame; So purer light shall mark the road That leads me to the Lamb.
