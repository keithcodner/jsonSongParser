[Verse 1] 
‘Tis finished! the Messiah dies, cut off for sin, but not His own; accomplished is the sacrifice, the great redeeming work is done. ‘Tis finished! all the debt is paid, justice divine is satisfied, the grand and full atonement made; God for a guilty world hath died.


[Verse 2] 
The veil is rent in Christ alone; the living way to heaven is seen; the middle wall is broken down, and all mankind may enter in. The types and figures are fulfilled, exacted is the legal pain, the precious promises are sealed; the spotless Lamb of God is slain.


[Verse 3] 
The reign of sin and death is o’er, and all may live from sin set free; Satan has lost his mortal power; ‘tis swallowed up in victory. Saved from the legal curse I am, my Saviour hangs on yonder tree: see there the meek, expiring Lamb! ‘Tis finished, He expires for me.


[Verse 4] 
Accepted in the well-beloved, and clothed in righteousness divine, I see the bar to heaven removed, and all Thy merits, Lord, are mine. Death, hell, and sin are now subdued, all grace is now to sinners given, and lo, I plead the atoning blood, and in Thy right I claim Thy heaven.
