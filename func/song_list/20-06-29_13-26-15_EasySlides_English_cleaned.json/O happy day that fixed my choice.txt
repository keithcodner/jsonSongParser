[Verse 1] 
O happy day, that fixed my choice, On Thee, my Saviour and my God ! Well may this glowing heart rejoice, And tell its raptures all abroad


[Verse 2] 
Happy day, happy day When Jesus washed my sins away ! He taught me how to watch and pray, And live rejoicing ev'ry day. Happy day, happy day, When Jesus washed my sins away


[Verse 3] 
'Tis done, the great transaction's done ! I am my Lord's and He is mine: He drew me and I followed on, Charmed to confess the voice divine


[Verse 4] 
Happy day, happy day When Jesus washed my sins away ! He taught me how to watch and pray, And live rejoicing ev'ry day. Happy day, happy day, When Jesus washed my sins away


[Verse 5] 
Now rest, my long-divided heart, Fixed on this blissful centre, rest: Nor ever from thy Lord depart, With Him of every good possessed.


[Verse 6] 
Happy day, happy day When Jesus washed my sins away ! He taught me how to watch and pray, And live rejoicing ev'ry day. Happy day, happy day, When Jesus washed my sins away


[Verse 7] 
High heaven, that heard the solemn vow, That vow renewed shall daily hear, Till in life's latest hour I bow, And bless in death a bond so dear.


[Verse 8] 
Happy day, happy day When Jesus washed my sins away ! He taught me how to watch and pray, And live rejoicing ev'ry day. Happy day, happy day, When Jesus washed my sins away
