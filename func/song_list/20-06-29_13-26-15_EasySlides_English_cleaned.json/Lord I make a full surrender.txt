[Verse 1] 
Lord, I make a full surrender, all I have I yield to Thee; for Thy love so great and tender asks the gift of me.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, I bring my whole affection, claim it, take it for Thine own, safely kept by Thy protection, fixed on Thee alone.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, my will I here present Thee, gladly now no longer mine: let no evil thing prevent me blending it with Thine.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, my life I lay before Thee, hear, this hour, the sacred vow! All Thine own I now restore Thee, Thine for ever now.


[Verse 5] 
Glory, glory, hallelujah! I have given my all to God; and I now have full salvation, through the precious blood.   Repeat last two lines of each verse
