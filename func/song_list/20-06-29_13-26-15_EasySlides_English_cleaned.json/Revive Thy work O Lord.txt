[Verse 1] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord! Thy mighty arm make bare! Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people hear!


[Verse 2] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord; give Pentecostal showers; be Thine the glory, Thine alone! The blessing, Lord, be ours.


[Verse 3] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord! Disturb this sleep of death; quicken the smouldering embers now by Thine almighty breath.


[Verse 4] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord; give Pentecostal showers; be Thine the glory, Thine alone! The blessing, Lord, be ours.


[Verse 5] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord! Create soul-thirst for Thee; and hungering for the bread of life, oh, may our spirits be!


[Verse 6] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord; give Pentecostal showers; be Thine the glory, Thine alone! The blessing, Lord, be ours.


[Verse 7] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord! And bless to all Thy word! Oh, may its pure and sacred truth in living faith be heard!


[Verse 8] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord; give Pentecostal showers; be Thine the glory, Thine alone! The blessing, Lord, be ours.


[Verse 9] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord! Exalt Thy precious name: and by the Holy Ghost, our love for Thee and Thine inflame.


[Verse 10] 
Revive Thy work, O Lord; give Pentecostal showers; be Thine the glory, Thine alone! The blessing, Lord, be ours.
