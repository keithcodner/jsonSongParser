[Verse 1] 
Look what You've done for me Your blood has set me free Jesus my Lord look what You've done for me


[Verse 2] 
I haven't been the same Ever since that day I called Your name Yahweh yahweh, look what You've done for me


[Verse 3] 
What can I do for You my Lord? I want You to know my heart is Yours. It's not a question of what You can do for me But what can I do for You my Lord?


[Verse 4] 
Up to Your cross I crawled Now I am standing ten feet tall Jesus my saviour look what You've done for me


[Verse 5] 
Free at last I am free I owe You my life completely Yahweh yahweh, look what You've done for me
