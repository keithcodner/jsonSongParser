[Verse 1] 
The Nazarene had come to live the life of every man And he felt the fascination of the stars And as He wandered through this weary world He wondered and He wept For there were so few who'd listen to His call


[Verse 2] 
He came, He saw, He surrendered all So that we might be born again And the fact of His humanity was there for all to see For He was unlike any other man And yet so much like me


[Verse 3] 
The Nazarene could hunger and the Nazarene could cry And He could laugh with all the fullness of His heart And those who hardly knew Him And those who knew Him well Could feel the contradiction from the start


[Verse 4] 
He came, He saw, He surrendered all So that we might be born again And the fact of His humanity was there for all to see For He was unlike any other man And yet so much like me


[Verse 5] 
He came, He saw, He surrendered all So that we might be born again And the fact of His humanity was there for all to see For He was unlike any other man And yet so much like me
