[Verse 1] 
God is the strength of my heart God is the strength of my heart God is the strength of my heart And my portion forever (2X) Forever 


[Verse 2] 
Whom have I in heaven but You There is nothing on earth I desire besides You My heart and my strength Many time they fail But there is one truth that always will prevail
