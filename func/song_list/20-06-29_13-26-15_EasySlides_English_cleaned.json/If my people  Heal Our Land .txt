[Verse 1] 
If my people will humble themselves, Humble themselves and pray, If they see my face and humble themselves, And turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from Heaven And forgive their sin, I will hear from Heaven And heal their land.


[Verse 2] 
Lord heal our land, Father heal our land, Hear our cry and turn our nation back to You. Lord heal our land, Hear us, O Lord, And heal our land, forgive our sin And heal our broken land.
