[Verse 1] 
O sing a new song to the Lord: sing all the earth to God. To God sing, bless His name, show still His saving health abroad.


[Verse 2] 
Among the heathen nations His glory do declare; and unto all the people show His works that wondrous are.


[Verse 3] 
For greatâ€™s the Lord, and greatly He is to be magnified; yea, worthy to be feared is He above all gods beside.


[Verse 4] 
For all the gods are idols dumb, which blinded nations fear; but our God is the Lord, by whom the heavens created were.


[Verse 5] 
Great honour is before His face, and majesty divine; strength is within His holy place, and there doth beauty shine.


[Verse 6] 
Do ye ascribe unto the Lord, of people every tribe, glory do ye unto the Lord, and mighty power ascribe.


[Verse 7] 
Give ye the glory to the Lord that to His name is due; come ye into His courts, and bring an offering with you.


[Verse 8] 
In beauty of His holiness, do the Lord adore; likewise let all the earth throughout tremble His face before.
