[Verse 1] 
What a fellowship, what a joy divine, leaning on the everlasting arms; what a blessedness, what a peace is mine, leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 2] 
Leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms; leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way! leaning on the everlasting arms. Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day! leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 4] 
Leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms; leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 5] 
What have I to dread, what have I to fear? leaning on the everlasting arms? I have blessed peace with my Lord so near. leaning on the everlasting arms.


[Verse 6] 
Leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms; leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.
