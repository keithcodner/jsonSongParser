[Verse 1] 
There’s a wideness in God’s mercy that is wider than the greatest sea; and so I know it covers even me. There’s a depth to His compassion that is deeper than I’ll understand; and so my life is safe within His hands. His love is deep enough for me, to cause these blinded eyes to see, to set this lowly captive free from sin. His grace is flowing from above, reflected in the Saviour’s love O precious Father, help me take it in.
