[Verse 1] 
I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken I'm accepted, You were condemned. I'm alive and well Your spirit is within me Because you died and rose again.


[Verse 2] 
Amazing love, how can it be? That You my King would die for me. Amazing love, I know its true And it's my joy to honour You In all I do, I honour You


[Verse 3] 
You are my King You are my King Jesus, You are my Kingâ€¦
