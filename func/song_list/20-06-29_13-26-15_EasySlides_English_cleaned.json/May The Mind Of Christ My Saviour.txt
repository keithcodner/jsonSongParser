[Verse 1] 
May the mind of Christ my saviour Live in me from day to day, By His love and power controlling All I do and say.


[Verse 2] 
May the word of God dwell richly In my heart from hour to hour, So that all may see I triumph Only through His power.


[Verse 3] 
May the peace of God my Father Rule my life in everything, That I may be calm to comfort Sick and sorrowing.


[Verse 4] 
May the love of Jesus fill me, As the waters fill the sea; Him exalting, self abasing, This is victory.


[Verse 5] 
May I run the race before me, Strong and brave to face the foe, Looking only unto Jesus, As I onward go.
