[Verse 1] 
Oh, now I see the cleansing wave, the fountain deep and wide; Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save, points to His wounded side.


[Verse 2] 
The cleansing stream I see, I see! I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me! Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me. It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.


[Verse 3] 
I see the new creation rise; I hear the speaking blood! It speaks! polluted nature dies! Sinks 'neath the cleansing flood.


[Verse 4] 
The cleansing stream I see, I see! I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me! Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me. It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.


[Verse 5] 
I rise to walk in heaven's own light, above the world and sin, with heart made pure and garments white, and Christ enthroned within.


[Verse 6] 
The cleansing stream I see, I see! I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me! Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me. It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.


[Verse 7] 
Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below to feel the blood applied; and Jesus, only Jesus know, my Jesus crucified.


[Verse 8] 
The cleansing stream I see, I see! I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me! Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me. It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.
