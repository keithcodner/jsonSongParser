[Verse 1] 
O love that wilt not let me go, I rest my weary soul in thee: I give thee back the life I owe, That in thine ocean depths its flow May richer, fuller be.


[Verse 2] 
O light that followest all my way, I yield my flickering torch to thee: My heart restores its borrowed ray, That in thy sunshine's blaze its day May brighter, fairer be.


[Verse 3] 
O joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee: I trace the rainbow through the rain, And feel the promise is not vain, That morn shall tearless be.


[Verse 4] 
O cross that liftest up my head, I dare not ask to fly from thee: I lay in dust life's glory dead, And from the ground there blossoms red Life that shall endless be.
