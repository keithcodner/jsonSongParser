[Verse 1] 
It came upon the midnight clear, That glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth To touch their harps of gold: 'Peace on the earth, goodwill to men From heaven's all gracious King!' The world in solemn stillness lay To hear the angels sing.


[Verse 2] 
Still through the cloven skies they come, With peaceful wings unfurled, And still their heavenly music floats O'er all the weary world: Above its sad and lowly plains They bend on hovering wing, And ever o'er its Babel sounds The bless√®d angels sing.


[Verse 3] 
Yet with woes of sin and strife The world has suffered long, Beneath the angel-strain have rolled Two thousand years of wrong; And man, at war with man, hears not The love-song which they bring: O hush the noise, ye men of strife, And hear the angels sing.


[Verse 4] 
For lo! the days are hastening on, By prophet bards foretold, When with the ever-circling years Comes round the age of gold; When peace shall over all the earth Its ancient splendours fling, And all the world send back the song Which now the angels sing.
