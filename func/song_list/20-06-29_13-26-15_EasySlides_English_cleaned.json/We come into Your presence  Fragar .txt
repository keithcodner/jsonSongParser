[Verse 1] 
We come into Your presence with singing, Come into Your presence with praise; And enter Your gates With thankful hearts, We are going to celebrate. All of Heaven's waiting, Pow'r is on its way; So, we shout, "Hallelujah!" Lifting to you a mighty roar of praise.


[Verse 2] 
You deserve the highest praise That we can give, and more; Lord, we give You our praise, That's what we came here for. (repeat) 


[Verse 3] 
Everthing within me; Reaches out to You Your power, Your majesty, Grace and mercy too. There'll be singing and dancing, Hearts and voices raised; You have set Your people free, Now the house is filled with praise.


[Verse 4] 
You deserve the highest praise
