[Verse 1] 
Love was when God became a man, Locked in time and space, without rank or place; Love was God born of Jewish kin; Just a carpenter with some fishermen;   Love was when Jesus walked in history, Lovingly He brought a new life that's free, Love was God nailed to bleed and die To reach and love one such as I. 


[Verse 2] 
Love was when God became a man, Down where I could see love that reached to me; Love was God dying for my sin And so trapped was I my whole world caved in.   Love was when Jesus met me, now it's real; Lovingly He came, I can feel He's real! Love was God, only He would try To reach and love one such as I.
