[Verse 1] 
I bind unto myself today the strong name of the Trinity, by invocation of the same, the Three in One and One in Three.


[Verse 2] 
I bind this day to me for ever, by pow'r of faith, Christ's incarnation, his baptism in the Jordan river, his death on cross for my salvation; his bursting from the spic√®d tomb, his riding up the heav'nly way, his coming at the day of doom, I bind unto myself today.


[Verse 3] 
I bind unto myself the pow'r of the great love of cherubim; the sweet 'Well done!' in judgement hour; the service of the seraphim, confessors' faith, apostles' word, the patriarchs' prayers, the prophets' scrolls, all good deeds done unto the Lord, and purity of faithful souls.


[Verse 4] 
PART TWO


[Verse 5] 
Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me. Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.


[Verse 6] 
DOXOLOGY


[Verse 7] 
I bind unto myself the name, the strong name of the Trinity, by invocation of the same, the Three in One and One in Three, of whom all nature hath creation, eternal Father, Spirit, Word. Praise to the Lord of my salvation: salvation is of Christ the Lord. Amen.
