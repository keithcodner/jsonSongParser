[Verse 1] 
My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus’ blood and righteousness; I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.


[Verse 2] 
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand; all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.


[Verse 3] 
When darkness seems to veil His face I rest on His unchanging grace; in every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.


[Verse 4] 
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand; all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.


[Verse 5] 
His oath, His covenant, and blood, support me in the ‘whelming flood; when all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.


[Verse 6] 
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand; all other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand.
