[Verse 1] 
Blessed be the Fountain of blood, to a world of sinners revealed: blessed be the dear Son of God; only by His stripes are we healed. Though I’ve wandered far from His fold, bringing to my heart pain and woe, wash me in the blood of the Lamb, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 2] 
Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, wash me in the blood of the Lamb, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 3] 
Thorny was the crown that He wore, and the cross His body o’ercame; grievous were the sorrows He bore, but He suffered thus not in vain. May I to that fountain be led, made to cleanse my sins here below; wash me in the blood that He shed, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 4] 
Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, wash me in the blood of the Lamb, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 5] 
Father, I have wandered from Thee, often has my heart gone astray; crimson do my sins seem to me: water cannot wash them away. Jesus, to that fountain of Thine, leaning on Thy promise I go, cleanse me by Thy washing divine, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 6] 
Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, wash me in the blood of the Lamb, and I shall be whiter than snow.
