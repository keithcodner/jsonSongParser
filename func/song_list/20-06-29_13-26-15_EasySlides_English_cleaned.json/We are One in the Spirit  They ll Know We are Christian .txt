[Verse 1] 
We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord, We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord, And we pray that all unity may one day be restored:


[Verse 2] 
And they'll know we are Christians By our love, by our love, Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.


[Verse 3] 
We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand, We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand, And together we'll spread the news that God is in our land:


[Verse 4] 
And they'll know we are Christians By our love, by our love, Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.


[Verse 5] 
We will work with each other, we will work side by side, We will work with each other, we will work side by side, And we'll guard each man's dignity and save each man's pride:


[Verse 6] 
And they'll know we are Christians By our love, by our love, Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
