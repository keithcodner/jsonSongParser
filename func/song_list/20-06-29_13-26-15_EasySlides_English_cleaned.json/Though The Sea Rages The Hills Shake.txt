[Verse 1] 
Though the sea rages, the hills shake, And I struggle, yet I hold on. 'Tis the grace of God that brings me through and cares for me all the way. Worldly snares abound, and 'gainst the tide I must go, but I move on. 'Tis the grace of God that brings me through And cares for me all the way.   E'en though life's troubles come, Yet your loving grace n'er falters. Though pain and hardship come my way, Yet I won't despair or fear. Though life's storms rage on, Yet I will not fear, for God cares for me. (Repeat)
