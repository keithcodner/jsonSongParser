[Verse 1] 
O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me, and all things else recede! My heart be daily nearer Thee, from sin be daily freed.


[Verse 2] 
Each day let Thy supporting might my weakness still embrace; my darkness vanish in Thy light, Thy life my death efface.


[Verse 3] 
In Thy bright beams which on me fall fade every evil thought; that I am nothing, Thou art all, I would be daily taught.


[Verse 4] 
More of Thy glory let me see, Thou Holy, Wise, and True! I would Thy living image be, in joy and sorrow too.


[Verse 5] 
Fill me with gladness from above, hold me by strength Divine; Lord, let the glow of Thy great love through my whole being shine.


[Verse 6] 
Make this poor self grow less and less, be Thou my life and aim; oh, make me daily through Thy grace more meet to bear Thy name!
