[Verse 1] 
One fine morning when this life is over I'll fly away To a land where joys will never end I'll fly away


[Verse 2] 
I'll fly away, O Lord singing, I'll fly away When I rise, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away


[Verse 3] 
When dark shadow of this life draw nigh I'll fly away Like a bird far from these prison walls I'll fly away


[Verse 4] 
I'll fly away, O Lord singing, I'll fly away When I rise, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away


[Verse 5] 
Just a few more weary days and then I'll fly away To a home secure and without end I'll fly away


[Verse 6] 
I'll fly away, O Lord singing, I'll fly away When I rise, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away
