[Verse 1] 
We never need be vanquished, we never need give in, though waging war with Satan, and compassed round by sin. Temptations will beset us, allurements oft assail, but in the name of Jesus we shall, we must prevail.


[Verse 2] 
God wills not that His people by sin enthralled should be, but that their lives, as ransomed, be lives of victory; and so at our disposal He places all His power, that we from its resources may draw in danger’s hour.


[Verse 3] 
Herein is hid the secret of an all-glorious life whereby we conquer Satan, and rise above sin’s strife. Abiding in the Saviour, self prostrate in the dust, we live to do His bidding in glad perpetual trust.


[Verse 4] 
We in ourselves are nothing, a small and feeble host, nor have we aught of prowess wherein to make our boast. Our stronghold is Christ Jesus, His grace alone we plead, His name our shield and banner, Himself, just all we need.
