“Suffer the children!” Oh, hear His voice, let every heart leap forth and rejoice; and let us freely make Him our choice. do not delay, but come.

Joyful, joyful will the meeting be, when from sin our hearts are pure and free, and we shall gather, Saviour, with Thee, in our eternal home.

Think once again, He’s with us today; heed now His blest command, and obey; hear now His accents tenderly say, “Will you, My children, come?”
