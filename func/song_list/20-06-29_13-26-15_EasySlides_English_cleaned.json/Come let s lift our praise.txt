[Verse 1] 
Come, let's lift our praise, Lord, to you our song we raise, we will shout and sing with joy to you our God. For you are our coming King, let us raise our voice and sing, Lord, we magnify your name on high.


[Verse 2] 
How good is it to praise and sing, with thanksgiving we lift our hearts. All the heavens above will declare his love and his enemies depart.


[Verse 3] 
Let us praise his name, people now proclaim his victorious majesty. Shout your praises high, all the earth and sky. Joy that lasts for eternity
