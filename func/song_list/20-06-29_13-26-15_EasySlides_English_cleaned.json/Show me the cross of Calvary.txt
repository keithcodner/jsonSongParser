[Verse 1] 
Show me the cross of Calvary, open my eyes to see Thy dying form in agony - Lord, make it real to me.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, make Calvary real to me! Jesus, dying in agony, Thy great sacrifice let me see: Lord, make Calvary real to me!


[Verse 3] 
Show me the cross of Calvary, open my ears to Thy plea: “Father, forgive them!” - can it be? Lord, make it real to me.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, make Calvary real to me! Jesus, dying in agony, Thy great sacrifice let me see: Lord, make Calvary real to me!


[Verse 5] 
Low at the cross of Calvary, bowed is my heart as I see grace that can save eternally - Lord, make it real to me.


[Verse 6] 
Lord, make Calvary real to me! Jesus, dying in agony, Thy great sacrifice let me see: Lord, make Calvary real to me!
