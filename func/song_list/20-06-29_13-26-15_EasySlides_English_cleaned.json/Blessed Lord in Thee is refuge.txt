[Verse 1] 
Blessed Lord, in Thee is refuge, safety for my trembling soul, power to lift my head when drooping, ‘midst the angry billows’ roll. I will trust Thee, I will trust Thee, I will trust Thee, all my life Thou shalt control.


[Verse 2] 
In the past too unbelieving ‘midst the tempest I have been, and my heart has slowly trusted what my eyes have never seen. Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, teach me on Thine arm to lean.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, for trust that brings the triumph, when defeat seems strangely near! Oh, for faith that changes fighting into victory’s ringing cheer! Faith triumphant! faith triumphant! faith triumphant! knowing not defeat or fear.


[Verse 4] 
Faith triumphant - blessed victory! Every barrier swept away! Heaven descending, joy and fullness, dawn of everlasting day! Jesus only, Jesus only, Jesus only, Him to love and Him obey.
