[Verse 1] 
We have heard the joyful sound, Jesus saves; spread the gladness all around, Jesus saves; bear the news to every land, climb the steeps and cross the waves, onward, 'tis our Lord's command, Jesus saves.


[Verse 2] 
Waft it on the rolling tide, tell to sinners far and wide, sing, ye islands of the sea, echo back, ye ocean caves, earth shall keep her jubilee, Jesus saves.


[Verse 3] 
Sing above the battle's strife, by His death and endless life, sing it softly through the gloom, when the heart for mercy craves, sing in triumph o'er the tomb, Jesus saves.


[Verse 4] 
Give the winds a mighty voice, let the nations now rejoice, shout salvation full and free, highest hills and deepest caves, this our song of victory, Jesus saves.
