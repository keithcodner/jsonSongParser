[Verse 1] 
When none was found to ransom me He was found worthy; to set a world of sinners free, He was found worthy.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! He was found worthy.


[Verse 3] 
To take the book and loose the seal, to bruise the head that bruised His heel.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! He was found worthy.


[Verse 5] 
To bridge the gulf ‘twixt man and God, and save the rebels by His blood.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! He was found worthy.


[Verse 7] 
To open wide the gates of heaven; to Him all majesty is given.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! He was found worthy.


[Verse 9] 
To reign o’er all the ransomed race; I’ve tasted of His saving grace.


[Verse 10] 
Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! He was found worthy.


[Verse 11] 
His blood has washed me white as snow, and all His fullness I shall know.


[Verse 12] 
Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! Oh, the bleeding Lamb! He was found worthy.
