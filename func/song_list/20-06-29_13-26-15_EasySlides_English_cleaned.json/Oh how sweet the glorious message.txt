[Verse 1] 
Oh, how sweet the glorious message simple faith may claim; yesterday, today, for ever, Jesus is the same. Still He loves to save the sinful, heal the sick and lame; cheer the mourner, still the tempest; glory to His name!


[Verse 2] 
Yesterday, today, for ever, Jesus is the same. All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His name.


[Verse 3] 
He who was the Friend of sinners seeks you, lost one, now; sinner, come, and at His footstool penitently bow. He who said, “I’ll not condemn you, go, and sin no more,” speaks to you that word of pardon, as in days of yore.


[Verse 4] 
Yesterday, today, for ever, Jesus is the same. All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His name.


[Verse 5] 
He who pardoned erring Peter, never need you fear; He that came to faithless Thomas, all your doubt will clear. He who let the loved disciple on His bosom rest, bids you still, with love as tender, lean upon His breast.


[Verse 6] 
Yesterday, today, for ever, Jesus is the same. All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His name.


[Verse 7] 
He who, ‘mid the raging billows, walked upon the sea, still can hush our wildest tempest, as on Galilee. He who wept and prayed in anguish in Gethsemane, drinks with us each cup of trembling in our agony.


[Verse 8] 
Yesterday, today, for ever, Jesus is the same. All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His name.


[Verse 9] 
As of old He walked to Emmaus, with them to abide; so through all life’s way He walketh ever near our side. Soon again shall we behold Him, hasten, Lord, the day! But ‘twill still be “this same Jesus,” as He went away.


[Verse 10] 
Yesterday, today, for ever, Jesus is the same. All may change, but Jesus never! Glory to His name.
