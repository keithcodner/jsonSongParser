[Verse 1] 
I'm the property of Jesus, Satan has no right to me; for, to free me from his bondage, Jesus died on Calvary.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, I love, I love my Master, and I will not go out free. I am His today, for ever, His for all eternity.


[Verse 3] 
I'm the property of Jesus; I no longer am my own; all my heart to Him is yielded, and He sits upon the throne.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, I love, I love my Master, and I will not go out free. I am His today, for ever, His for all eternity.


[Verse 5] 
I'm the property of Jesus; oh, what joy the knowledge brings! I belong to Christ the Saviour, Christ, who is the King of kings.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, I love, I love my Master, and I will not go out free. I am His today, for ever, His for all eternity.
