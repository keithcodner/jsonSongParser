[Verse 1] 
I am coming to the cross, I am poor and weak and blind: I am counting all but dross; I shall full salvation find.


[Verse 2] 
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, blessed Lamb of Calvary; humbly at Thy cross I bow: Jesus saves me, saves me now.


[Verse 3] 
Long my heart has sighed for Thee, long has evil reigned within; Jesus sweetly speaks to me: “I will cleanse you from all sin.”


[Verse 4] 
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, blessed Lamb of Calvary; humbly at Thy cross I bow: Jesus saves me, saves me now.


[Verse 5] 
Here I give my all to Thee, friends and time and earthly store, soul and body, Thine to be, wholly Thine for evermore.


[Verse 6] 
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, blessed Lamb of Calvary; humbly at Thy cross I bow: Jesus saves me, saves me now.


[Verse 7] 
In the promises I trust, now I know the blood applied; I am prostrate in the dust, I with Christ am crucified.


[Verse 8] 
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, blessed Lamb of Calvary; humbly at Thy cross I bow: Jesus saves me, saves me now.


[Verse 9] 
Jesus comes! He fills my soul! Perfected in Him I am: I am every whit made whole: Glory, glory to the Lamb!


[Verse 10] 
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee, blessed Lamb of Calvary; humbly at Thy cross I bow: Jesus saves me, saves me now.
