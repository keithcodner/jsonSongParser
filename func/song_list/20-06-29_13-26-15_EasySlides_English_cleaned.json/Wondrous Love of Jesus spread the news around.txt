[Verse 1] 
Wondrous Love of Jesus! spread the news around, pardon freely offered, what a joyful sound! Jesus, loving Saviour, died to set me free; oh, that blessed “Whosoever,” that means me.


[Verse 2] 
Pardon freely offered all who will believe; whosoever cometh Jesus will receive; Jesus, loving Saviour, died to set us free: hallelujah! “Whosoever” that means me.


[Verse 3] 
Whosoever cometh may the promise claim, precious blood of Jesus cleanseth every stain. The Son of God has loved me, wonder can it be? “Whosoever,” saith the Saviour that means me.


[Verse 4] 
Pardon freely offered all who will believe; whosoever cometh Jesus will receive; Jesus, loving Saviour, died to set us free: hallelujah! “Whosoever” that means me.


[Verse 5] 
Do not trust your feeling, trust His word alone. Prayers can never save you, tears cannot atone. “Finished!” cried the Saviour, nothing now to do. Come, believe this “Whosoever” - that means you.


[Verse 6] 
Pardon freely offered all who will believe; whosoever cometh Jesus will receive; Jesus, loving Saviour, died to set us free: hallelujah! “Whosoever” that means me.
