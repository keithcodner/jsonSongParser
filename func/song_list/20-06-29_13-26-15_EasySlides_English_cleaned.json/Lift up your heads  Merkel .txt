[Verse 1] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, let the King of Glory come in; be lifted up, O ancient doors; let the King of Glory come in.


[Verse 2] 
The altars we've built and the works we have done can never compare to the Saviour's love; the hearts of the humble are temples of praise as we worship the Ancient of Days, as we worship the Ancient of Days.


[Verse 3] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, let the King of Glory come in; be lifted up, O ancient doors; let the King of Glory come in.


[Verse 4] 
Glory to the Lord our God; glory to the Lamb on the throne; we open wide the gates of our hearts, with our lips we rise up and praise as we worship the Ancient of Days.


[Verse 5] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, let the King of Glory come in; be lifted up, O ancient doors; let the King of Glory come in.


[Verse 6] 
Who can ascend to the hill of the Lord? People of clean hearts and hands. You, who are righteous and seeking his face, come and worship the Ancient of Days, come and worship the Ancient of Days.


[Verse 7] 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, let the King of Glory come in; be lifted up, O ancient doors; let the King of Glory come in.
