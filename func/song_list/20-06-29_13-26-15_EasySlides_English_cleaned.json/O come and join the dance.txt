[Verse 1] 
O come and join the dance that all began so long ago, when Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem. Through all the years of darkness still the dance goes on and on, oh, take my hand and come and join the song.


[Verse 2] 
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) O lift your voice and sing, and open up your heart to welcome him. Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) and welcome now your King, for Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem.


[Verse 3] 
Come, shed your heavy load and dance your worries all away, for Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem. He came to break the pow'r of sin and turn your night to day, oh, take my hand and come and join the song.


[Verse 4] 
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) O lift your voice and sing, and open up your heart to welcome him. Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) and welcome now your King, for Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem.


[Verse 5] 
Let laughter ring and angels sing and joy be all around, for Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem. And if you seek with all your heart he surely can be found, oh, take my hand and come and join the song.


[Verse 6] 
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) O lift your voice and sing, and open up your heart to welcome him. Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) and welcome now your King, for Christ the Lord was born in Bethlehem.
