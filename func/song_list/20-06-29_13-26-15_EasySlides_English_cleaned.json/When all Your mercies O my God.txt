[Verse 1] 
When all Your mercies, O my God, my rising soul surveys, transported with the view, I’m lost in wonder, love, and praise.


[Verse 2] 
Unnumbered comforts on my soul Your tender care bestowed, before my infant heart conceived from whom those comforts flowed.


[Verse 3] 
Ten thousand thousand precious gifts my daily thanks employ, nor is the least a cheerful heart that tastes those gifts with joy.


[Verse 4] 
Through every period of my life Your goodness I’ll pursue and, after death, in distant worlds, the glorious theme renew.


[Verse 5] 
Through all eternity to You a joyful song I’ll raise; for, oh, eternity’s too short to utter all Your praise!
