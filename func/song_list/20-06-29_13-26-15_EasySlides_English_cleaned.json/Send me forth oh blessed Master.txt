[Verse 1] 
Send me forth, oh, blessed Master, where are souls in sorrow bowed; send me forth to homes of want and homes of care; and with joy I will obey the call, and in Thy blessed name I will take the blessed light of the gospel there.


[Verse 2] 
Call me forth...to active service, and my prompt response shall be, “Here am I! send me.” I am ready to report for orders, Master, summon me, and I'll go on any errand of love for Thee.


[Verse 3] 
There are lives that may be brightened by a word of hope and cheer, there are souls with whom life's blessings I should share, there are hearts that may be lightened of the burdens which they bear; let me take the blessed hope of the gospel there.


[Verse 4] 
Call me forth...to active service, and my prompt response shall be, “Here am I! send me.” I am ready to report for orders, Master, summon me, and I'll go on any errand of love for Thee.


[Verse 5] 
There is work within the vineyard, there is service to be done, there's a message of salvation to declare; send me forth to tell the story to the hearts of sinful men; let me take the blessed Christ of the gospel there.


[Verse 6] 
Call me forth...to active service, and my prompt response shall be, “Here am I! send me.” I am ready to report for orders, Master, summon me, and I'll go on any errand of love for Thee.


[Verse 7] 
Oh, I would not be an idler in the vineyard of the Lord; with the Christ the vineyard labour I would share; into hearts that know not Jesus I would speak the saving word; let me take the blessed joy of the gospel there.


[Verse 8] 
Call me forth...to active service, and my prompt response shall be, “Here am I! send me.” I am ready to report for orders, Master, summon me, and I'll go on any errand of love for Thee.
