[Verse 1] 
I hear angels singing praises, I see men from every nation, Bowing down - before the throne. Like the sound of many waters, Like a rushing wind around us, Multitudes - join the song.   And a symphony of praise arises; Tears are wiped away from eyes, As men from ev'ry tongue and tribe, All sing……


[Verse 2] 
Holy Holy, God Almighty, who was, Who is and is to come; All the angels are crying 'Holy', To the Lamb who sits upon the throne. Holy Holy, God Almighty, who was, Who is and is to come; All creation is bringing glory, To the Lamb who sits upon the throne.


[Verse 3] 
I see one who's full of wonder, Eyes of fire and voice of thunder, Shining bright - His majesty. All the colours of the rainbow, Circles Him - and fill - His temple, So beautiful - this is to me.   And a symphony of praise arises; Tears are wiped away from eyes, As men from ev'ry tongue and tribe, All sing……


[Verse 4] 
Holy Holy, God Almighty, who was, Who is and is to come; All the angels are crying 'Holy', To the Lamb who sits upon the throne. Holy Holy, God Almighty, who was, Who is and is to come; All creation is bringing glory, To the Lamb who sits upon the throne.
