[Verse 1] 
On bended knee I come, with a humble heart I come, bowing down before your holy throne; lifting holy hands to you, as I pledge my love anew, I worship you in spirit, I worship you in truth, make my life a holy praise unto you.


[Verse 2] 
On bended knee we come, with a humble heart we come, bowing down before your holy throne; lifting holy hands to you, as we pledge our love anew, we worship you in spirit, we worship you in truth, make our lives a holy praise unto you, make our lives a holy praise unto you.
