[Verse 1] 
There is life for a look at the Crucified One, there is life at this moment for thee; then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved, unto Him who was nailed to the tree.


[Verse 2] 
Look, look, look and live, there is life for a look at the Crucified One, there is life at this moment for thee.


[Verse 3] 
It is not thy tears of repentance nor prayers, but the blood that atones for the soul; on Him then believe, and a pardon receive, for His blood now can make thee quite whole.


[Verse 4] 
Look, look, look and live, there is life for a look at the Crucified One, there is life at this moment for thee.


[Verse 5] 
We are healed by His stripes; wouldst thou add to the word? And He is our righteousness made; the best robe of heaven He bids thee to wear, oh, couldst thou be better arrayed?


[Verse 6] 
Look, look, look and live, there is life for a look at the Crucified One, there is life at this moment for thee.


[Verse 7] 
Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared there remaineth no more to be done; that once in the end of the world He appeared, and completed the work He begun.


[Verse 8] 
Look, look, look and live, there is life for a look at the Crucified One, there is life at this moment for thee.


[Verse 9] 
But take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at once, the life everlasting He gives: and know with assurance thou never canst die, since Jesus thy righteousness lives.


[Verse 10] 
Look, look, look and live, there is life for a look at the Crucified One, there is life at this moment for thee.
