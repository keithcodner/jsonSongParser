[Verse 1] 
There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come, no more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye; all is peace forever more on that happy golden shore, what a day, glorious day that will be!


[Verse 2] 
What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see, and I look upon His face, the One who saved me by His grace; when He takes me be the hand and leads me through the promised Land, what a day, glorious day that will be!


[Verse 3] 
Thereâ€™ll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear, no more sickness, no pain, no more parting over there; and for ever I will be with the One who died for me what a day, glorious day that will be!


[Verse 4] 
What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see, and I look upon His face, the One who saved me by His grace; when He takes me be the hand and leads me through the promised Land, what a day, glorious day that will be!
