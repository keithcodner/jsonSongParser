[Verse 1] 
I have a Friend so precious, so very dear to me, He loves me with such tender love, He loves so faithfully; I could not live apart from Him, I love to feel Him nigh, and so we dwell together, my Lord and I.


[Verse 2] 
He knows how much I love Him, He knows I love Him well; but with what love He loveth me my tongue can never tell; it is an everlasting love, in ever rich supply, and so we love each other, my Lord and I.


[Verse 3] 
He knows how I am longing some weary soul to win, and so He bids me go and speak the loving word for Him; He bids me tell His wondrous love, and why He came to die, and so we work together, my Lord and I.


[Verse 4] 
So up into the mountains of heaven’s cloudless light, or away into the valleys of darkness or of night. Though round us tempests gather and storms are raging high, we’ll travel on together, my Lord and I.


[Verse 5] 
And when the journey’s ended, in rest and peace at last, when every thought of danger and weariness is past, in the Kingdom of the future, in the glory by and by, we’ll live and reign together, my Lord and I.
