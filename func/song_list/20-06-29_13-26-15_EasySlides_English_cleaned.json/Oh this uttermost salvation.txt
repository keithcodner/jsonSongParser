[Verse 1] 
Oh, this uttermost salvation! ‘Tis a fountain full and free, pure, exhaustless, ever flowing, wondrous grace! it reaches me!


[Verse 2] 
It reaches me! it reaches me! wondrous grace! it reaches me! Pure, exhaustless, ever flowing, wondrous grace! it reaches me!


[Verse 3] 
How amazing God’s compassion, that so vile a worm should prove this stupendous bliss of heaven, this unmeasured wealth of love!


[Verse 4] 
It reaches me! it reaches me! wondrous grace! it reaches me! Pure, exhaustless, ever flowing, wondrous grace! it reaches me!


[Verse 5] 
Jesus, Saviour, I adore Thee! Now Thy love I will proclaim; I will tell the blessed story, I will magnify Thy name!


[Verse 6] 
It reaches me! it reaches me! wondrous grace! it reaches me! Pure, exhaustless, ever flowing, wondrous grace! it reaches me!
