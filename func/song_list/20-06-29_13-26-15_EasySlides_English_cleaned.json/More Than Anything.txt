[Verse 1] 
More than anything, more than anything, I love You, Jesus, more than anything, More than anything, more than anything, I love You, Jesus, more than anything.


[Verse 2] 
More than anything, more than anything, I love You, Jesus, more than anything, More than worldly wealth, more than life itself, I love You, Jesus, more than anything.


[Verse 3] 
Nothing in this world can take Your place, Or ever take Your love away, Someday I will see You face to face, Look into Your eyes and say


[Verse 4] 
More than anything, more than anything, I love You, Jesus, more than anything, More than worldly wealth, more than life itself, I love You, Jesus, more than anything.
