[Verse 1] 
I am weak but thou art strong, Jesus keep me from all wrong. I'll be satisfied as long, As I walk, let me walk, close with thee.


[Verse 2] 
Just a closer walk with thee; Grant it, Jesus, this my plea. Daily walking close with thee; Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.


[Verse 3] 
Through the world of toils and snares; If I flatter, Lord, who cares? Who with me, my burden shares? None but thee, dear Lord, none but thee.


[Verse 4] 
Just a closer walk with thee; Grant it, Jesus, this my plea. Daily walking close with thee; Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.


[Verse 5] 
When my feeble life is o'er, Time for me will be no more. Guide me gently, safely home, To thy kingdom's shore, to thy shore.


[Verse 6] 
Just a closer walk with thee; Grant it, Jesus, this my plea. Daily walking close with thee; Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
