[Verse 1] 
It may not be on the mountain's height, or over the stormy sea; it may not be at the battle's front my Lord will have need of me; but if by a still, small voice He calls to paths that I do not know, I'll answer, “Dear Lord, with my hand in Thine, I'll go where You want me to go.”


[Verse 2] 
I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord, over mountain, or plain, or sea; I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord, I'll be what You want me to be.


[Verse 3] 
Perhaps today there are loving words which Jesus would have me speak; there may be now in the paths of sin some wanderer whom I should seek; O Saviour, if Thou wilt be my guide, though dark and rugged the way, my voice shall echo the message sweet, I'll say what You want me to say.


[Verse 4] 
I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord, over mountain, or plain, or sea; I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord, I'll be what You want me to be.


[Verse 5] 
There's surely somewhere a lowly place, in earth's harvest fields so wide, where I may labour through life's short day for Jesus the crucified. So trusting my all to Thy tender care, and knowing Thou lovest me, I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere, I'll be what You want me to be.


[Verse 6] 
I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord, over mountain, or plain, or sea; I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord, I'll be what You want me to be.
