[Verse 1] 
How I praise Thee, precious Saviour, that Thy love laid hold of me! Thou hast saved, and cleansed, and filled me, that I may Thy channel be.


[Verse 2] 
Channels only, blessed Master, yet, with all Thy wondrous power flowing through us, Thou canst use us every day and every hour.


[Verse 3] 
Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me, a clean vessel in Thine hand, with no power but as Thou givest, graciously, with each command.


[Verse 4] 
Channels only, blessed Master, yet, with all Thy wondrous power flowing through us, Thou canst use us every day and every hour.


[Verse 5] 
Witnessing Thy power to save me, setting free from self and sin; Thou who boughtest me to possess me, in Thy fullness, Lord, come in.


[Verse 6] 
Channels only, blessed Master, yet, with all Thy wondrous power flowing through us, Thou canst use us every day and every hour.


[Verse 7] 
Just a channel full of blessing, to the thirsty hearts around; to tell out Thy full salvation, all Thy loving message sound.


[Verse 8] 
Channels only, blessed Master, yet, with all Thy wondrous power flowing through us, Thou canst use us every day and every hour.


[Verse 9] 
Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit hearts that full surrender know, that the streams of living water from our inner man may flow.


[Verse 10] 
Channels only, blessed Master, yet, with all Thy wondrous power flowing through us, Thou canst use us every day and every hour.
