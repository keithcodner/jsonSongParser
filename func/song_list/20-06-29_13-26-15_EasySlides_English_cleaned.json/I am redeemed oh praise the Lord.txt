[Verse 1] 
I am redeemed, oh, praise the Lord! My soul, from bondage free, has found at last a resting place in Him who died for me!


[Verse 2] 
I am redeemed! I am redeemed! I’ll sing it o’er and o’er; I am redeemed! oh, praise the Lord! Redeemed for ever more!


[Verse 3] 
I looked, and lo, from Calvary’s cross a healing fountain streamed; it cleansed my heart, and now I sing, praise God, I am redeemed!


[Verse 4] 
I am redeemed! I am redeemed! I’ll sing it o’er and o’er; I am redeemed! oh, praise the Lord! Redeemed for ever more!


[Verse 5] 
The debt is paid, my soul is free; and by His mighty power, the blood that washed my sins away still cleanseth every hour.


[Verse 6] 
I am redeemed! I am redeemed! I’ll sing it o’er and o’er; I am redeemed! oh, praise the Lord! Redeemed for ever more!


[Verse 7] 
All glory be to Jesus’ name! I know that He is mine! For on my heart the Spirit seals His pledge of love Divine.


[Verse 8] 
I am redeemed! I am redeemed! I’ll sing it o’er and o’er; I am redeemed! oh, praise the Lord! Redeemed for ever more!


[Verse 9] 
And when I reach that world more bright than mortal ever dreamed, I’ll cast my crown at Jesus’ feet and cry, “Redeemed, redeemed!”


[Verse 10] 
I am redeemed! I am redeemed! I’ll sing it o’er and o’er; I am redeemed! oh, praise the Lord! Redeemed for ever more!
