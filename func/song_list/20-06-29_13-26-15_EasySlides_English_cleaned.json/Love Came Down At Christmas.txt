[Verse 1] 
Love came down at christmas, Love all lovely, Love divine; Love was born at Christmas, Star and angels gave the sign.


[Verse 2] 
Worship we the Godhead, Love Incarnate, Love divine; Worship we our Jesus: But wherewith for sacred sign?


[Verse 3] 
Love shall be our token, Love be yours and love be mine, Love to God and all men, Love for plea and gift and sign.
