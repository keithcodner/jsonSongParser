[Verse 1] 
Is there a mountain in your way? Do doubts and fears abound Press on, oh, hear the Spirit say, 'This mountain shall come down.'


[Verse 2] 
Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed By my Spirit saith the Lord


[Verse 3] 
Is there a river in your path? A river deep and wide Step in, the waters will roll back You'll reach the other side


[Verse 4] 
Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed By my Spirit saith the Lord


[Verse 5] 
Is there a fiery furnace trial Far more than you can bear? Behold the blessed Son of God Is walking with you there.


[Verse 6] 
Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed By my Spirit saith the Lord


[Verse 7] 
Then trust alone the Mighty God He speaks the winds obey Take courage then, Oh fainting heart For you He'll make a way


[Verse 8] 
Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts Not by might, not by pow'r By my Spirit saith the Lord This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed This mountain shall be removed By my Spirit saith the Lord
