[Verse 1] 
You life laid down crucified Your arms stretched out and open wide To rescue me so I can be a child of God From nail pierced hands to Thorn pierced brow Your blood flows down to me somehow It cleanses me so I can be a child of God


[Verse 2] 
Praise to the lamb that was slain Praise to the Father who gave his son away The proof of love, the price of grace You traded all to take my place You died for me so I can be A child of God
