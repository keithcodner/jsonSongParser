[Verse 1] 
God holds the key of all unknown and I am glad; if other hands should hold the key or if he trusted it to me, I might be sad.


[Verse 2] 
What if tomorrow's cares were here without its rest! I'd rather he unlocked the day, and, as the hours swing open, say, my will is best.


[Verse 3] 
I cannot read his future plans; but this I know: I have the smiling of his face and all the refuge of his grace while here below.


[Verse 4] 
Enough; this covers all my wants and so I rest; for what I cannot, he can see and in his care I saved shall be for ever blest.
