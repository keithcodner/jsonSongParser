[Verse 1] 
He's given me a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. He's given me a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
A crown of beauty, instead of ashes. The oil of gladness, instead of mourning. My soul rejoices as I delight myself in God. He's given me a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair
