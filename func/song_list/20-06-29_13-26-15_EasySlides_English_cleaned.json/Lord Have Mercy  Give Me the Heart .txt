Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on Your people. Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on Your people.

Give me the heart of stone within you, all I'll give you a heart of flesh. Clean water I will use to cleanse all you wounds, My spirit I give to you.

Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on Your people. Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on Your people.

You'll find Me near the broken-hearted, those crushed in spirit I will save. So turn to Me for My pardon is great, My word will heal all your wounds.


[Verse 5] 
Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on Your people. Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy on Your people.
