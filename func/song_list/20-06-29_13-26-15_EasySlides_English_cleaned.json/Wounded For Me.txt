[Verse 1] 
Wounded for me, wounded for me, There on the cross He was wounded for me; Gone my transgressions and now I am free, All because Jesus was wounded for me.


[Verse 2] 
Risen for me, risen for me, Up from the grave He has risen for me; Now evermore from death's sting I am free, All because Jesus has risen for me.


[Verse 3] 
Living for me, living for me, There on the Throne He is living for me; Saved to the uttermost now I shall be, All because Jesus is living for me.


[Verse 4] 
Coming for me, coming for me, One day to earth He is coming for me; Then with what joy His dear face I shall see, Oh, how I praise Him ? He's coming for me.
