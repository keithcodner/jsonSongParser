[Verse 1] 
Father we ask of You this day Come and heal our land Knit our hearts together That Your glory might be seen in us Then the world will know That Jesus Christ is Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Let us be one voice, That glorifies Your name Let us be one voice, Declaring that You reign Let us be one voice, In love and harmony, And we pray, O God, Grant us unity.


[Verse 3] 
Now is the time for you and I To join our hearts in praise That the name of Jesus Will be lifted high above the earth Then the world will know That Jesus Christ is Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Let us be one voice, That glorifies Your name Let us be one voice, Declaring that You reign Let us be one voice, In love and harmony, And we pray, O God, Grant us unity.
