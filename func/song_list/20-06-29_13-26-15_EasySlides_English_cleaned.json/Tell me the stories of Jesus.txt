[Verse 1] 
Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear; things I would ask him to tell me if he were here: scenes by the wayside, tales of the sea, stories of Jesus, tell them to me.


[Verse 2] 
First let me hear how the children stood round his knee, and I shall fancy his blessing resting on me; words full of kindness, deeds full of grace, all in the lovelight of Jesus' face.


[Verse 3] 
Into the city I'd follow, there take my stand, waving a branch of the palm tree high in my hand; one of his heralds, yes, I would sing loudest hosannas, Jesus is King!
