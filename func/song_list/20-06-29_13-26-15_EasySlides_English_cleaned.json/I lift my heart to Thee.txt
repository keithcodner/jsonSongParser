[Verse 1] 
I lift my heart to Thee, Saviour divine; for Thou art all to me, and I am Thine. Is there on earth a closer bond than this, that my Beloved's mine, and I am His?


[Verse 2] 
Thine am I by all ties; but chiefly Thine, that through Thy sacrifice Thou, Lord, art mine. By Thine own cords of love so sweetly wound around me, I to Thee am closely bound.


[Verse 3] 
To Thee, Thou bleeding Lamb, I all things owe; all that I have and am, and all I know. All that I have is now no longer mine, and I am not my own; Lord, I am Thine.


[Verse 4] 
How can I, Lord, withhold life's brightest hour from Thee, or gathered gold, or any power? Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee, when Thou hast given Thine own dear Self for me?
