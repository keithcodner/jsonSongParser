[Verse 1] 
Mirrors hanging in their place show the dirt upon my face. God's Word shows me that within I am deeply stained with sin.


[Verse 2] 
I love the Bible, I love the Bible, I love the Bible, it is the Word of God.


[Verse 3] 
Milk is good for babies small and for grown-ups, great and tall. Milk is likened to God's Word, helps me grow to please the Lord.


[Verse 4] 
I love the Bible, I love the Bible, I love the Bible, it is the Word of God.


[Verse 5] 
After dark we take a light, making daylight out of night. If we read God's Word each day, it will guide us on our way.


[Verse 6] 
I love the Bible, I love the Bible, I love the Bible, it is the Word of God.


[Verse 7] 
Satan is my enemy but he runs away from me, if I use the Spirit's sword. Great and mighty is God's Word.


[Verse 8] 
I love the Bible, I love the Bible, I love the Bible, it is the Word of God.
