[Verse 1] 
One thing I of the Lord desire, for all my path hath miry been: be it by water or by fire, oh, make me clean, oh, make me clean!


[Verse 2] 
So wash me, Thou, without within, or purge with fire, if that must be; no matter how, if only sin die out in me, die out in me.


[Verse 3] 
I watch to shun the miry way, and staunch the springs of guilty thought; but, watch and struggle as I may, pure I am not, pure I am not.


[Verse 4] 
So wash me, Thou, without within, or purge with fire, if that must be; no matter how, if only sin die out in me, die out in me.


[Verse 5] 
If clearer vision Thou impart, grateful and glad my soul shall be, but yet to have a purer heart is more to me, is more to me.


[Verse 6] 
So wash me, Thou, without within, or purge with fire, if that must be; no matter how, if only sin die out in me, die out in me.


[Verse 7] 
Yea, only as this heart is clean may larger vision yet be mine, for mirrored in the depths are seen the things divine, the things divine.


[Verse 8] 
So wash me, Thou, without within, or purge with fire, if that must be; no matter how, if only sin die out in me, die out in me.
