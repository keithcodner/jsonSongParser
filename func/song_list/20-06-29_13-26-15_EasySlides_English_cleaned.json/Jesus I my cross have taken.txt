[Verse 1] 
Jesus, I my cross have taken, all to leave and follow Thee, destitute, despised, forsaken, Thou from hence, my all shalt be. Perish every fond ambition, all I've sought, and hoped and known: yet how rich is my condition! God and heaven are still my own.


[Verse 2] 
Let the world despise and leave me: they have left my Saviour too - human hearts and looks deceive me: Thou art not, like them, untrue. And whilst Thou shalt smile upon me, God of wisdom, love, and might, foes may hate, and friends disown me: show Thy face and all is bright.


[Verse 3] 
Man may trouble and distress me, 'twill but drive me to Thy breast; life with trials hard may press me, heaven will bring me sweeter rest. Oh! 'tis not in grief to harm me, while Thy love is left to me; oh! 'twere not in joy to charm me, were that joy unmixed with Thee.
