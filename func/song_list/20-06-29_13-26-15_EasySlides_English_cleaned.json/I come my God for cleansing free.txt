[Verse 1] 
I come, my God, for cleansing, free from sin’s defiling stains, I see, oh God, I weep to see the sinfulness corrupting me which in my heart remains.


[Verse 2] 
I hate my envy and my pride, my failure and my sin, to think that all these things could hide within, where blood had been applied, and stay concealed therein.


[Verse 3] 
Oh, let me not side-step the cross in this my crisis hour, excuse so subtly selfish dross, and gain my life when death seems loss, and miss Your path, Your power.


[Verse 4] 
I come, Lord Jesus, hear my cry, oh cleanse my heart today, I come to Calvary to die, and with your death identify, this is the only way.


[Verse 5] 
I come, I trust, and now I see the power of Jesus’ blood; grace channels in His purity, and in Him I find liberty and rest and joy in God.
