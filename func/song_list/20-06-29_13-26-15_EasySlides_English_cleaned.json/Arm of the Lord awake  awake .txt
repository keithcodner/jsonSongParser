[Verse 1] 
Arm of the Lord, awake, awake! Thy power unconquerable take; Thy strength put on, assert Thy might, and triumph in the dreadful fight.


[Verse 2] 
Why dost Thou tarry, mighty Lord? Why slumbers in its sheath Thy sword? O rouse Thee, for Thine honour’s sake; arm of the Lord, awake, awake!


[Verse 3] 
Behold, what numbers still withstand Thy sovereign rule and just command, reject Thy grace, Thy threats despise, and hurl defiance at the skies.


[Verse 4] 
Haste then, but come not to destroy; mercy is Thine, Thy crown, Thy joy: their hatred quell, their pride remove, but melt with grace, subdue with love.


[Verse 5] 
Why dost Thou from the conquest stay? Why do Thy chariot wheels delay? Lift up Thyself, hell’s kingdom shake; arm of the Lord, awake, awake!
