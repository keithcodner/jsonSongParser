[Verse 1] 
It's all about You, Jesus For Your glory and Your fame It's not about me As if you should do things my way You alone are God and I surrender To Your ways


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, lover of my soul All consuming fire is in your gaze Jesus, I want You to know I will follow You all of my days For no one else in history is like You And history itself belongs to You Alpha and Omega, You have loved me And I will share eternity with You
