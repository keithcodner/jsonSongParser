[Verse 1] 
Once in royal David's city stood a lowly cattle shed, where a mother laid her baby in a manger for his bed: Mary was that mother mild, Jesus Christ her little child.


[Verse 2] 
He came down to earth from heaven, who is God and Lord of all, and his shelter was a stable, and his cradle was a stall; with the poor and meek and lowly, lived on earth our Saviour holy.


[Verse 3] 
And through all his wondrous childhood day by day like us he grew; he was little, weak and helpless, tears and smiles like us he knew; and he feeleth for our sadness, and he shareth in our gladness.


[Verse 4] 
Still among the poor and lowly hope in Christ is brought to birth, with the promise of salvation for the nations of the earth; still in him our life is found and our hope of heav'n is crowned.


[Verse 5] 
And our eyes at last shall see him through his own redeeming love, for that child so dear and gentle is our Lord in heav'n above; and he leads his children on to the place where he is gone.


[Verse 6] 
Not in that poor lowly stable, with the oxen standing by, we shall see him, but in heaven, set at God's right hand on high; when like stars his children crowned, all in white shall wait around.
