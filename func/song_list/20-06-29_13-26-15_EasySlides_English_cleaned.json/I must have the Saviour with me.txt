[Verse 1] 
I must have the Saviour with me for I dare not walk alone, I must feel His presence near me, and His arm around me thrown.


[Verse 2] 
Then my soul shall fear no ill, let Him lead me where He will, I will go without a murmur, and His footsteps follow still.


[Verse 3] 
I must have the Saviour with me for my faith at best is weak; He can whisper words of comfort, that no other voice can speak.


[Verse 4] 
Then my soul shall fear no ill, let Him lead me where He will, I will go without a murmur, and His footsteps follow still.


[Verse 5] 
I must have the Saviour with me in the onward march of life, through the tempest and the sunshine, through the battle and the strife.


[Verse 6] 
Then my soul shall fear no ill, let Him lead me where He will, I will go without a murmur, and His footsteps follow still.


[Verse 7] 
I must have the Saviour with me, and His eye the way must guide, till I reach the vale of Jordan, till I cross the rolling tide.


[Verse 8] 
Then my soul shall fear no ill, let Him lead me where He will, I will go without a murmur, and His footsteps follow still.
