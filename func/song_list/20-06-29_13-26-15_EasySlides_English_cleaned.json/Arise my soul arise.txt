[Verse 1] 
Arise, my soul, arise, shake off thy guilty fears, the bleeding Sacrifice in my behalf appears; before the throne my Surety stands, my name is written on His Hands.


[Verse 2] 
He ever lives above, for me to intercede, His all redeeming love, His precious blood to plead; His blood atoned for all our race, and sprinkles now the throne of grace.


[Verse 3] 
Five bleeding wounds He bears, received on Calvary: they pour effectual prayers, they strongly speak for me. “Forgive him, oh, forgive,” they cry, “Nor let the ransomed sinner die.”


[Verse 4] 
My God is reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear; He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear: with confidence I now draw nigh, and “Father, Abba Father!” cry.
