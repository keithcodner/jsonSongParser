[Verse 1] 
We sing the praise of Him who died, of Him who died upon the cross; the sinner’s hope let men deride, for this we count the world but lost.


[Verse 2] 
Inscribed upon the cross we see, in shining letters, “God is love”; He bears our sins upon the tree, He brings us mercy from above.


[Verse 3] 
The cross! it takes our guilt away, it holds the fainting spirit up; it cheers with hope the gloomy day and sweetens every bitter cup.


[Verse 4] 
It makes the coward spirit brave, and nerves the feeble arm for fight; it takes the terror from the grave, and gilds the bed of death with light.


[Verse 5] 
The balm of life, the cure of woe, the measure and the pledge of love; the sinner’s refuge here below, the angels’ theme in heaven above.
