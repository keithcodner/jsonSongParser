[Verse 1] 
Standing by a purpose true, heeding God's command, honour them the faithful few all hail to Daniel's band. Dare to be a Daniel! Dare to stand alone! Dare to have a purpose firm! Dare to make it known.


[Verse 2] 
Many mighty men are lost, daring not to stand, who for God had been a host by joining Daniel's band.


[Verse 3] 
Many giants, great and small, stalking through the land, headlong to the earth would fall, if met by Daniel's band.


[Verse 4] 
Hold the gospel banner high! On to victory grand! Satan and his host defy, and shout for Daniel's band!
