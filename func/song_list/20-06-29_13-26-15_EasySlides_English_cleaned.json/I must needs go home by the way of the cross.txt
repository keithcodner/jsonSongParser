[Verse 1] 
I must needs go home by the way of the cross, there’s no other way but this; I shall ne’er get sight of the Gates of Light, if the way of the cross I miss.


[Verse 2] 
The way of the cross leads home, the way of the cross leads home, it is sweet to know, as I onward go, the way of the cross leads home.


[Verse 3] 
I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way. The path that the Saviour trod, if I ever climb to the heights sublime, where the soul is at home with God.


[Verse 4] 
The way of the cross leads home, the way of the cross leads home, it is sweet to know, as I onward go, the way of the cross leads home.


[Verse 5] 
Then I bid farewell to the way of the world, to walk in it never more; for my Lord says “Come,” and I seek my home, where He waits at the open door.


[Verse 6] 
The way of the cross leads home, the way of the cross leads home, it is sweet to know, as I onward go, the way of the cross leads home.
