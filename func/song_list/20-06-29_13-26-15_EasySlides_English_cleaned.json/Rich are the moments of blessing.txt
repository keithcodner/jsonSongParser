[Verse 1] 
Rich are the moments of blessing Jesus my Saviour bestows; pure is the well of salvation fresh from His mercy that flows.


[Verse 2] 
Ever He walketh beside me, brightly His sunshine appears, spreading a beautiful rainbow over the valley of tears.


[Verse 3] 
Rich are the moments of blessing, lovely, and hallowed, and sweet, when from my labour at noon-tide calmly I rest at His feet.


[Verse 4] 
Ever He walketh beside me, brightly His sunshine appears, spreading a beautiful rainbow over the valley of tears.


[Verse 5] 
Why should I ever grow weary? Why should I faint by the way? Has He not promised to give me strength for the toils of the day?


[Verse 6] 
Ever He walketh beside me, brightly His sunshine appears, spreading a beautiful rainbow over the valley of tears.


[Verse 7] 
Though by the mist and the shadow sometimes my sky may be dim, rich are the moments of blessing spent in communion with Him.


[Verse 8] 
Ever He walketh beside me, brightly His sunshine appears, spreading a beautiful rainbow over the valley of tears.
