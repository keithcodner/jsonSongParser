[Verse 1] 
I have one deep, supreme desire, that I may be like Jesus. To this I fervently aspire, that I may be like Jesus. I want my heart His throne to be, so that a watching world may see His likeness shining forth in me. I want to be like Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
He spent His life in doing good; I want to be like Jesus. In lowly paths of service trod; I want to be like Jesus. He sympathised with hearts distressed, He spoke the words that cheered and blessed, He welcomed sinners to His breast. I want to be like Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
A holy, harmless life He led; I want to be like Jesus. The Father’s will, His drink and bread; I want to be like Jesus. And when at last He comes to die, “Forgive them, Father,” hear Him cry for those who taunt and crucify. I want to be like Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
O perfect life of Christ, my Lord! I want to be like Jesus. My recompense and my reward, that I may be like Jesus. His Spirit fill my hungering soul, His power all my life control. My deepest prayer, my highest goal, that I may be like Jesus.
