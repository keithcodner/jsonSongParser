[Verse 1] 
Give me a sight, O Saviour, of Thy wondrous love to me, of the love that brought Thee down to earth, to die on Calvary.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, make me understand it, help me to take it in, what it meant to Thee, the Holy One, to bear away my sin.


[Verse 3] 
Was it the nails, O Saviour, that bound Thee to the tree? Nay, â€˜twas Thine everlasting love, Thy love for me, for me.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, make me understand it, help me to take it in, what it meant to Thee, the Holy One, to bear away my sin.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, wonder of all wonders, that through Thy death for me, my open sins, my secret sins, can all forgiven be.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, make me understand it, help me to take it in, what it meant to Thee, the Holy One, to bear away my sin.


[Verse 7] 
Then melt my heart, O Saviour, bend me, yea, break me down, until I own Thee Conqueror, and Lord and Sovereign crown.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, make me understand it, help me to take it in, what it meant to Thee, the Holy One, to bear away my sin.
