[Verse 1] 
Son of God, you reign in heaven's glory, yet you chose to come to earth and save me, humbled yourself to die the cruellest death; no other act of love compares to this.


[Verse 2] 
The greatest gift I've ever received is the cross, the cross. For there you gave yourself up for me on the cross, the cross. And with the blood you poured out for me you have saved my soul. You have given me the greatest gift of all.


[Verse 3] 
Your heart aches for all the lost and hurting. At the cross you wait to take our burdens, longing to heal our wounds and make us whole; longing to hear us sing with thankful souls.


[Verse 4] 
The greatest gift I've ever received is the cross, the cross. For there you gave yourself up for me on the cross, the cross. And with the blood you poured out for me you have saved my soul. You have given me the greatest gift of all.
