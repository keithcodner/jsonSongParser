[Verse 1] 
My times are in Thy hand; my God, I wish them there; my life, my friends, my soul I leave entirely to Thy care.


[Verse 2] 
My times are in Thy hand, whatever they may be, pleasing or painful, dark or bright, as best may seem to Thee.


[Verse 3] 
My times are in Thy hand; why should I doubt or fear? My Father’s hand will never cause His child a needless tear.


[Verse 4] 
My times are in Thy hand, Jesus, the crucified! Those hands my cruel sins had pierced are now my guard and guide.


[Verse 5] 
My times are in Thy hand; I’ll always trust in Thee; and, after death, at Thy right hand I shall for ever be.
