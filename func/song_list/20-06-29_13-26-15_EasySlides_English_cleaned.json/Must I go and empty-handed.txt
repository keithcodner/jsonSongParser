[Verse 1] 
Must I go and empty-handed, Thus my dear Redeemer meet? Not one day of service give Him, Lay no trophy at His feet?


[Verse 2] 
Must I go and empty-handed, Must I meet my Saviour so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty-handed go?


[Verse 3] 
Not at death I shrink or falter, for my Saviour saves me now; but to meet Him empty-handed, thought of that now clouds my brow.


[Verse 4] 
Must I go and empty-handed, Must I meet my Saviour so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty-handed go?


[Verse 5] 
Oh, the years of sinning wasted! Could I but recall them now I would give them to my Saviour; to His will I gladly bow.


[Verse 6] 
Must I go and empty-handed, Must I meet my Saviour so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty-handed go?


[Verse 7] 
Oh, ye saints, arouse, be earnest! Up and work while yet 'tis day; ere the night of death o'ertake you, strive for souls while yet you may.


[Verse 8] 
Must I go and empty-handed, Must I meet my Saviour so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty-handed go?
