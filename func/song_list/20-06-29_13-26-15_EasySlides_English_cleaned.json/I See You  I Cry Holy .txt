[Verse 1] 
I see You sitting on Your throne, O Lord, You are high and lifted up, Above the highest worship, I can offer You.


[Verse 2] 
I cry Holy, I cry worthy, I cry Holy to the Lamb, I cry Holy, worthy, Holy is the Lamb, I cry Holy, worthy, Holy is the Lamb.


[Verse 3] 
I bow myself before Your throne, O Lord, Lifting high and Holy hands, For beside You Lord, in heaven, There's no other.


[Verse 4] 
I cry Holy, I cry worthy, I cry Holy to the Lamb, I cry Holy, worthy, Holy is the Lamb, I cry Holy, worthy, Holy is the Lamb.
