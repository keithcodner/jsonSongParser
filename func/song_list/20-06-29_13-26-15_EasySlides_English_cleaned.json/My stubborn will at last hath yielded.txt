[Verse 1] 
My stubborn will at last hath yielded, I would be Thine and Thine alone; and this the prayer my lips are bringing, Lord, let in me Thy will be done.


[Verse 2] 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee; sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee.


[Verse 3] 
I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary, the darksome path hath dreary grown, but now a light has risen to cheer me! I find in Thee my Star, my Sun.


[Verse 4] 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee; sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Thy precious will, O conquering Saviour, doth now embrace and compass me; all discords hushed, my peace a river, my soul, a prisoned bird set free.


[Verse 6] 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee; sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee.


[Verse 7] 
Shut in with Thee, O Lord, for ever, my wayward feet no more to roam; what power from Thee my soul can sever? The centre of God's will my home.


[Verse 8] 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee; sweet will of God, still fold me closer, till I am wholly lost in Thee.
