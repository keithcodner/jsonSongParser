[Verse 1] 
Oh! the bitter shame and sorrow, that a time could ever be, when I let the Saviour’s pity plead in vain, and proudly answered, “All of self, and none of Thee.”


[Verse 2] 
Yet He found me: I beheld Him bleeding on the cursed tree, heard Him pray, “Forgive them, Father!” And my wistful heart said faintly: “Some of self, and some of Thee.”


[Verse 3] 
Day by day His tender mercy, healing, helping, full and free, sweet and strong, and ah! so patient brought me lower, while I whispered, “Less of self, and more of Thee.”


[Verse 4] 
Higher than the highest heavens, deeper than the deepest sea, Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered! Grant me now my soul’s petition: “None of self, and all of Thee.” (Tune 2 repeat last line of each verse.)
