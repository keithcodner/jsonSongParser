[Verse 1] 
God loved the world of sinners, lost and ruined by the Fall; salvation full, at highest cost, He offers free to all.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, ‘twas love, ‘twas wondrous love, the love of God to me; it brought my Saviour from above, to die on Calvary.


[Verse 3] 
E’en now, by faith, I claim Him mine, the risen Son of God! Redemption by His death I find, and cleansing through the Blood.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, ‘twas love, ‘twas wondrous love, the love of God to me; it brought my Saviour from above, to die on Calvary.


[Verse 5] 
Love brings the glorious fullness in, and to His saints makes known the blessed rest from inbred sin, through faith in Christ alone.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, ‘twas love, ‘twas wondrous love, the love of God to me; it brought my Saviour from above, to die on Calvary.


[Verse 7] 
Believing souls, rejoicing go! There shall to you be given a glorious foretaste, here below, of endless rest in heaven.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, ‘twas love, ‘twas wondrous love, the love of God to me; it brought my Saviour from above, to die on Calvary.


[Verse 9] 
Of victory now o’er Satan’s power let all the ransomed sing, and triumph in the dying hour, through Christ the Lord, our King.


[Verse 10] 
Oh, ‘twas love, ‘twas wondrous love, the love of God to me; it brought my Saviour from above, to die on Calvary.
