[Verse 1] 
Christ is made the sure foundation, Christ the head and cornerstone, chosen of the Lord, and precious, binding all the Church in one, holy Zion's help for ever, and her confidence alone.


[Verse 2] 
To this temple, where we call you, come, O Lord of hosts, today; you have promised loving kindness, hear your servants as we pray, bless your people now before you, turn our darkness into day.


[Verse 3] 
Hear the cry of all your people, what they ask and hope to gain; what they gain from you, for ever with your chosen to retain, and hereafter in your glory evermore with you to reign.


[Verse 4] 
Praise and honour to the Father, praise and honour to the Son, praise and honour to the Spirit, ever Three and ever One, One in might and One in glory, while unending ages run.
