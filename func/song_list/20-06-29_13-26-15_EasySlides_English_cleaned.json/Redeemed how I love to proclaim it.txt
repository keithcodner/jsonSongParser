[Verse 1] 
Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, redeemed through His infinite mercy; His child and for ever I am.


[Verse 2] 
Redeemed, Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; redeemed, redeemed, His child and for ever, I am.


[Verse 3] 
Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus, no language my rapture can tell; I know that the light of His presence with me doth continually dwell.


[Verse 4] 
Redeemed, Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; redeemed, redeemed, His child and for ever, I am.


[Verse 5] 
I know I shall see in His beauty the King in whose law I delight, who lovingly guardeth my footsteps, and giveth me songs in the night.


[Verse 6] 
Redeemed, Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; redeemed, redeemed, His child and for ever, I am.


[Verse 7] 
I know thereâ€™s a crown that is waiting in yonder bright mansion for me, and soon with the spirits made perfect, at home with the Lord I shall be.


[Verse 8] 
Redeemed, Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; redeemed, redeemed, His child and for ever, I am.
