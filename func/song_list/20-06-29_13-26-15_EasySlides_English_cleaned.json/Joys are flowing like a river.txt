[Verse 1] 
Joys are flowing like a river since the Comforter has come: He abides with us for ever, makes the trusting heart His home.


[Verse 2] 
Blessed quietness! holy quietness! What assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, speaking peace to me, how the billows cease to roll!


[Verse 3] 
Bringing life and health and gladness all around, this glorious Guest banished unbelief and sadness, changed our weariness to rest.


[Verse 4] 
Blessed quietness! holy quietness! What assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, speaking peace to me, how the billows cease to roll!


[Verse 5] 
Like the rain that falls from heaven, like the sunlight from the sky, so the Holy Ghost is given, coming on us from on high.


[Verse 6] 
Blessed quietness! holy quietness! What assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, speaking peace to me, how the billows cease to roll!


[Verse 7] 
See, a fruitful field is growing, blessed fruits of righteousness! And the streams of life are flowing in the lonely wilderness.


[Verse 8] 
Blessed quietness! holy quietness! What assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, speaking peace to me, how the billows cease to roll!


[Verse 9] 
What a wonderful salvation, where we always see His face! What a peaceful habitation, what a quiet resting place!


[Verse 10] 
Blessed quietness! holy quietness! What assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, speaking peace to me, how the billows cease to roll!
