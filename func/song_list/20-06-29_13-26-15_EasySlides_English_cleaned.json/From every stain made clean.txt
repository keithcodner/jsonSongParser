[Verse 1] 
From every stain made clean, from every sin set free; oh, blessed Lord, this is the gift that Thou hast promised me. And pressing through the past of failure, fault, and fear, before Thy cross my all I cast, and dare to leave it there.


[Verse 2] 
From Thee I would not hide my sin because of fear what men may think; I hate my pride, and as I am appear. Just as I am, O Lord, not what I'm thought to be; just as I am, a struggling soul for life and liberty.


[Verse 3] 
While in Thy light I stand, my heart, I seem to see, has failed to take from Thine own hand the gifts it offers me. O Lord, Thy plenteous grace, Thy wisdom and Thy power, I here proclaim before Thy face, can keep me every hour.


[Verse 4] 
Upon the altar here I lay my treasure down; I only want to have Thee near, King of my heart to crown. The fire doth surely burn my every selfish claim; and while from them to Thee I turn, I trust in Thy great name.


[Verse 5] 
A heart by blood made clean, in every wish and thought; a heart that by God's power has been into subjection brought; to walk, to weep, to sing, within the light of heaven; this is the blessing, Saviour, King, that Thou to me hast given!
