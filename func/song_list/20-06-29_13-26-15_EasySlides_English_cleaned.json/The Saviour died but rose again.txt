[Verse 1] 
The Saviour died, but rose again triumphant from the grave; and pleads our cause at God’s right hand, omnipotent to save.


[Verse 2] 
Who then can e’er divide us more from Jesus and his love, or break the sacred chain that binds the earth to heaven above?


[Verse 3] 
Let troubles rise, and terrors frown, and days of darkness fall; through Him all dangers we’ll defy, and more than conquer all.


[Verse 4] 
Nor death nor life, nor earth nor hell, nor time’s destroying sway, can e’er efface us from His heart, or make His love decay.


[Verse 5] 
Each future period that will bless, as it has blessed the past; He loved us from the first of time, He loves us to the last.
