[Verse 1] 
Not I, but Christ, be honoured, loved, exalted; not I, but Christ, be seen, be known, be heard; not I, but Christ, in ev'ry look and action; not I, but Christ, in ev'ry thought and word.


[Verse 2] 
Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow; not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear; not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden; not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.


[Verse 3] 
Not I, but Christ, in lowly, silent labour; not I, but Christ, in humble earnest toil; Christ, only Christ, no show, no ostentation; Christ, none but Christ, the gatherer of the spoil.


[Verse 4] 
Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision; glory excelling, soon, full soon, I'll see - Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling - Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.
