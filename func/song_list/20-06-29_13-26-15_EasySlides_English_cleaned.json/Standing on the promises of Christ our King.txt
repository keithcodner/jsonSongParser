Standing on the promises of Christ our King, through eternal ages let His praises ring: glory in the highest I will shout and sing, standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 2] 
Standing, standing, standing on the promises of God, my Saviour, standing, standing, I’m standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 3] 
Standing on the promises that cannot fail, when the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, by the living word of God I shall prevail, standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 4] 
Standing, standing, standing on the promises of God, my Saviour, standing, standing, I’m standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 5] 
Standing on the promises I now can seeperfect, present cleansing in the blood for me; standing in the liberty where Christ makes free, standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 6] 
Standing, standing, standing on the promises of God, my Saviour, standing, standing, I’m standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 7] 
Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord, bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord, overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword, standing on the promises of God.


[Verse 8] 
Standing, standing, standing on the promises of God, my Saviour, standing, standing, I’m standing on the promises of God.
