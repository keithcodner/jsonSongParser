[Verse 1] 
I can only imagine what it will be like When I wake by Your side I can only imagine what me eyes will see When Your face is before me I can only imagine. Yeah.


[Verse 2] 
Surrounded by Your glory What will my heart feel Will I dance for you Jesus Or in awe of You be still Will I stand in Your presence Or to my knees will fall Will I sing Hallelujah Will I be able to speak at all I can only imagine, I can only imagine


[Verse 3] 
I can only imagine when that day comes And I find myself Standing in the sun I can only imagine when all I will do Is forever, forever worship You I can only imagine. Yeah!


[Verse 4] 
Surrounded by Your glory What will my heart feel Will I dance for you Jesus Or in awe of You be still Will I stand in Your presence Or to my knees will fall Will I sing Hallelujah Will I be able to speak at all I can only imagine, I can only imagine
