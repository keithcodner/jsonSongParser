[Verse 1] 
I'm so happy and here's the reason why Jesus took my burden all away Now I'm singing as the days go by Jesus took my burden all away Once my heart was heavy with a load of sin Jesus took the load and gave me peace within Now I'm happy and that's the reason why Jesus took my burden all away
