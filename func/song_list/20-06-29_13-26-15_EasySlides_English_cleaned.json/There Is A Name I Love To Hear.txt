[Verse 1] 
There is a name I love to hear, I love to speak its worth; It sounds like music in my ear, The sweetest name on earth.


[Verse 2] 
O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, The sweetest name on earth.


[Verse 3] 
It tells me of a Saviour's love, Who died to set me free; It tells me of His precious blood, The sinner's perfect plea.


[Verse 4] 
O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, The sweetest name on earth.


[Verse 5] 
It tells of One whose loving heart Can feel my deepest woe; Who in my sorrow bears a part That none can bear below.


[Verse 6] 
O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, The sweetest name on earth.


[Verse 7] 
It bids my trembling heart rejoice, It dries each rising tear; It tells me in a still, small voice To trust and never fear.


[Verse 8] 
O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, The sweetest name on earth.


[Verse 9] 
Jesus, the name I love so well, The name I love to hear! No saint on earth its worth can tell, No heart conceive how dear!


[Verse 10] 
O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, O, how I love the Saviour's name, The sweetest name on earth.
