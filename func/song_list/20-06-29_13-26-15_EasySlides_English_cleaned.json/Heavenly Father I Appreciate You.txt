[Verse 1] 
Heavenly Father, I appreciate You. Heavenly Father, I appreciate You. I love You, adore You, I bow down before You. Heavenly Father, I appreciate You.


[Verse 2] 
Son of God, what a wonder You are. Son of God, what a wonder You are. You cleansed my soul from sin, You set the Holy Ghost within. Son of God, what a wonder You are.


[Verse 3] 
Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are. Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are. You lead us, You guide us, You live right inside us. Holy Ghost, what a comfort You are.
