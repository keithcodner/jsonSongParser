[Verse 1] 
Men: Men of faith rise up and sing Of the great and glorious King You are strong when we feel weak In your brokenness complete


[Verse 2] 
Shout to the North & the South Sing to the East & the West Jesus is saviour to all Lord of heaven and Earth!


[Verse 3] 
Women: Rise up women of the truth Stand & sing to broken hearts Who can know the healing power Of our awesome King of love


[Verse 4] 
We've been through fire We've been through rain We've been refined by the power of his name We've fallen deeper in love with You You've burnt the truth on our lips


[Verse 5] 
All: Rise up church with broken Wings Fill this place with songs again Of our God who reigns on high By His grace again we'll fly
