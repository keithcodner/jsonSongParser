[Verse 1] 
I lay my sins on Jesus, the spotless Lamb of God; He bears them all, and frees us from the accursed load. I bring my guilt to Jesus, to wash my crimson stains white in His blood most precious, till not a spot remains.


[Verse 2] 
I lay my wants on Jesus, all fullness dwells in Him: He heals all my diseases, He doth my soul redeem. I lay my griefs on Jesus, my burdens and my cares; He from them all releases; He all my sorrows shares.


[Verse 3] 
I rest my soul on Jesus, this weary soul of mine; His right hand me embraces, I on His breast recline. I love the name of Jesus, Immanuel, Christ, the Lord: like fragrance on the breezes, His name abroad is poured.


[Verse 4] 
I long to be like Jesus, meek, loving, lowly, mild; I long to be like Jesus, the Father’s holy child. I long to be with Jesus amid the heavenly throng, to sing with saints His praises, to learn the angels’ song.
