[Verse 1] 
Are you now in depths of sorrow, where no arm can reach so low? There is One whose arms almighty reach beyond your deepest woe. God the Eternal is your refuge. Let it still your wild alarms; underneath your deepest sorrow are the everlasting arms.


[Verse 2] 
Other arms grow faint and weary, these can never faint nor fail: others reach our mounts of blessing, these our lowest, loneliest vale. Oh, that all might know His friendship! Oh, that all might see His charms! Oh, that all might have beneath them Jesus’ everlasting arms!


[Verse 3] 
Underneath us, oh, how easy! We have not to mount on high, but to sink into His fullness, and in trustful weakness lie. And we find our humbling failures save us from the strength that harms, we may fail, but underneath us are the everlasting arms.


[Verse 4] 
Arms of Jesus! fold me closer to Thy strong and loving breast, till my spirit on Thy bosom finds its everlasting rest; and when time’s last sands are sinking, shield my heart from all alarms, softly whispering, “Underneath you are the everlasting arms.”
