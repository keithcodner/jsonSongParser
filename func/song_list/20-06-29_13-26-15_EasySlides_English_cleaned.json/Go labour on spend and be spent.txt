[Verse 1] 
Go, labour on, spend, and be spent, thy joy to do the Father's will; it is the way the Master went, should not the servant tread it still?


[Verse 2] 
Go, labour on; 'tis not for nought, thy earthly loss is heavenly gain; men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not, the Master praises, what are men?


[Verse 3] 
Men die in darkness at your side, without a hope to cheer the tomb: take up the torch, and wave it wide, the torch that lights time's thickest gloom.


[Verse 4] 
Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice, for toil comes rest, for exile home; soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice, the midnight peal, “Behold, I come!”
