[Verse 1] 
We plough the fields and scatter The good seed on the land, But it is fed and watered By God's almighty hand; He sends the snow in winter, The warmth to swell the grain, The breezes and the sunshine, And soft refreshing rain.


[Verse 2] 
All good gifts around us Are sent from heaven above; Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord, For all His love.


[Verse 3] 
He only is the Maker Of all things near and far; He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star; The winds and waves obey Him, By Him the birds are fed; Much more to us, His children, He gives our daily bread.


[Verse 4] 
All good gifts around us Are sent from heaven above; Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord, For all His love.


[Verse 5] 
We thank Thee, then, O Father, For all things bright and good; The seedtime and the harvest, Our life, our health, our food. No gifts have we to offer For all Thy love imparts, But that which Thou desirest, Our humble, thankful hearts.


[Verse 6] 
All good gifts around us Are sent from heaven above; Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord, For all His love.
