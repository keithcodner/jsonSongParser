[Verse 1] 
Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side. Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. Leave to your God to order and provide; In every change, He faithful will remain. Be still, my soul: your best, your heavenly Friend Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end. 


[Verse 2] 
Be still, my soul: your God will undertake To guide the future, as He has the past. Your hope, your confidence let nothing shake; All now mysterious shall be bright at last. Be still, my soul: the waves and winds shall know His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below. 


[Verse 3] 
Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on When we shall be forever with the Lord. When disappointment, grief and fear are gone, Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored. Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past All safe and blessed we shall meet at last
