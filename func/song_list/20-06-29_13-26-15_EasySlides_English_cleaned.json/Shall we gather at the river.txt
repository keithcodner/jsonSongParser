[Verse 1] 
Shall we gather at the river, where bright angel-feet have trod, with its crystal tide for ever flowing by the throne of God?


[Verse 2] 
Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river; gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.


[Verse 3] 
On the margin of the river, washing up its silver spray, we will walk and worship ever, all the happy, golden day.


[Verse 4] 
Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river; gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.


[Verse 5] 
Ere we reach the shining river, lay we ev'ry burden down; grace our spirits will deliver, and provide a robe and crown.


[Verse 6] 
Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river; gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.


[Verse 7] 
At the shining of the river, mirror of the Saviour's face, saints, whom death will never sever raise their songs of saving grace.


[Verse 8] 
Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river; gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.


[Verse 9] 
Soon we'll reach the silver river; soon our pilgrimage will cease; soon our happy hearts will quiver with the melody of peace.


[Verse 10] 
Yes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river; gather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.
