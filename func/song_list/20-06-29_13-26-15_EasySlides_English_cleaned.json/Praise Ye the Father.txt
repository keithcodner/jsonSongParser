[Verse 1] 
Praise ye the Father! Let every heart give thanks to Him! Praise ye the Father, Who is ever kind and merciful! Praise ye the Father, Who noteth every sparrow's fall! O King of Glory! Let all earth proclaim Thy majesty!   Sing of the Lord, Every voice proclaim His power! Who bringeth joy to the world, And whose mercy endureth forever! He hath made all the world, And the heaven above us! In His strength, in His love, He ruleth the world; Arise, and praise ye the Father!   Praise be to the Father, To the Son and Holy Spirit! Praise Him, every nation, All the earth shall rejoice in Him! Glory to the Lord our King! Glory to His everlasting name! Let all earth be glad, rejoicing in His love, Oh, praise ye the Lord!
