[Verse 1] 
Lord, I hear of showers of blessing Thou art scattering full and free, showers the thirsty land refreshing, let some drops descend on me, even me, even me, let some drops descend on me.


[Verse 2] 
Pass me not, O God, my Father, sinful though my heart may be! Thou might'st leave me, but the rather let Thy mercy light on me, even me, even me, let Thy mercy light on me.


[Verse 3] 
Pass me not, O tender Saviour! Let me love and cling to Thee. I am longing for Thy favour; whilst Thou'rt calling, oh, call me, even me, even me, whilst Thou'rt calling, oh call me.


[Verse 4] 
Pass me not, O mighty Spirit! Thou canst make the blind to see: witnesser of Jesus' merit, speak the word of power to me, even me, even me, speak the word of power to me.


[Verse 5] 
Love of God, so pure and changeless, blood of Christ, so rich and free; grace of God, so rich and boundless, magnify it all in me, even me, even me, magnify it all in me.
