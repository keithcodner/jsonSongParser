[Verse 1] 
My song shall be of Jesus; His mercy crowns my days, He fills my cup with blessings, And tunes my heart to praise; My song shall be of Jesus, The precious Lamb of God, Who gave Himself my ransom, And bought me with His blood.


[Verse 2] 
My song shall be of Jesus; When sitting at His feet, I call to mind His goodness, In meditation sweet: My song shall be of Jesus, Whatever ill betide; I'll sing the grace that saves me, And keeps me at His side.


[Verse 3] 
My song shall be of Jesus; While pressing on my way, To reach the blissful region Of pure and perfect day; And when my soul shall enter The gate of Eden fair, A song of praise to Jesus I'll sing for ever there.
