[Verse 1] 
Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin, each victory will help you some other to win; fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue, look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.


[Verse 2] 
Ask the Saviour to help you, comfort, strengthen, and keep you; He is willing to aid you, He will carry you through.


[Verse 3] 
Shun evil companions, bad language disdain, God’s name hold in reverence, nor take it in vain; be thoughtful and earnest, kind-hearted and true, look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.


[Verse 4] 
Ask the Saviour to help you, comfort, strengthen, and keep you; He is willing to aid you, He will carry you through.


[Verse 5] 
To him that o’ercometh God giveth a crown, through faith we shall conquer, though often cast down; He who is our Saviour our strength will renew, look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.


[Verse 6] 
Ask the Saviour to help you, comfort, strengthen, and keep you; He is willing to aid you, He will carry you through.
