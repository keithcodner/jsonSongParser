[Verse 1] 
I know not why God's wondrous grace To me hath been made known; Nor why, unworthy as I am, He claimed me for His own.


[Verse 2] 
But I know whom I have believèd; And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.


[Verse 3] 
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart; Or how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.


[Verse 4] 
But I know whom I have believèd; And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.


[Verse 5] 
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin; Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.


[Verse 6] 
But I know whom I have believèd; And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.


[Verse 7] 
I know not what of good or ill May be reserved for me, Of weary ways or golden days Before His face I see.


[Verse 8] 
But I know whom I have believèd; And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.


[Verse 9] 
I know not when my Lord may come; I know not how, nor where; If I shall pass the vale of death, Or 'meet Him in the air'.


[Verse 10] 
But I know whom I have believèd; And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.
