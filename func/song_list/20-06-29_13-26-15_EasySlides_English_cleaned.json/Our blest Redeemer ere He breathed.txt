[Verse 1] 
Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed His tender, last farewell, a Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed with us to dwell.


[Verse 2] 
He came sweet influence to impart, a gracious, willing guest, where He can find one humble heart wherein to rest.


[Verse 3] 
And His that gentle voice we hear, soft as the breath of even, that checks each thought, that calms each fear, and speaks of heaven.


[Verse 4] 
And every virtue we possess, and every conquest won, and every thought of holiness, are His alone.


[Verse 5] 
Spirit of purity and grace, our weakness, pitying, see; oh, make our hearts Thy dwelling place, and worthier Thee!


[Verse 6] 
Oh, praise the Father; praise the Son: blest Spirit, praise to Thee! All praise to God, the Three in One, the One in Three.
