[Verse 1] 
Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear; things I would ask Him to tell me if He were here; scenes by the wayside, tales of the sea, stories of Jesus, tell them to me.


[Verse 2] 
First let me hear how the children stood round His knee; that I may know of His blessing resting on me; words full of kindness, deeds full of grace, signs of the love found in Jesus’ face.


[Verse 3] 
Tell me, in words full of wonder, how rolled the sea, tossing the boat in a tempest on Galilee. Jesus then doing His Father’s will, ended the storm saying “Peace, peace, be still.”


[Verse 4] 
Into the city I’d follow the children’s band, waving a branch of the palm-tree high in my hand; worshipping Jesus, yes, I would sing loudest hosannas, for He is King!


[Verse 5] 
Show me that scene in the garden, of bitter pain; and of the cross where my Saviour for me was slain; and, through the sadness, help me to see how Jesus suffered for love of me.


[Verse 6] 
Gladly I’d hear of His rising out of the grave, living and strong and triumphant, mighty to save: and how He sends us all men to bring stories of Jesus, Jesus, their King.
