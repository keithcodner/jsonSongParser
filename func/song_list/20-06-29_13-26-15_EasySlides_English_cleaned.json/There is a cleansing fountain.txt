[Verse 1] 
There is a cleansing fountain, it flows from Calvary, ‘twas opened by the Saviour from sin each soul to free. And now His voice is calling with accents, oh so sweet! “Come to the cleansing river, down at the Mercy-seat.”


[Verse 2] 
Oh! Calvary’s stream is flowing, Calvary’s stream is flowing, flowing so free for you and for me, Calvary’s stream is flowing.


[Verse 3] 
Though worn and heavy laden, and burdened with your sin, there’s virtue in the river; oh, will you enter in? There’s healing in its waters, there’s cleansing in its stream; then look away to Calvary where mercy’s light does beam.


[Verse 4] 
Oh! Calvary’s stream is flowing, Calvary’s stream is flowing, flowing so free for you and for me, Calvary’s stream is flowing.


[Verse 5] 
This stream of life eternal for you is flowing free; oh, bow yourself for cleansing, and gain your liberty. Then Christ shall be your Saviour, and out of you shall flow a life of peace and heaven, God’s Paradise below.


[Verse 6] 
Oh! Calvary’s stream is flowing, Calvary’s stream is flowing, flowing so free for you and for me, Calvary’s stream is flowing.
