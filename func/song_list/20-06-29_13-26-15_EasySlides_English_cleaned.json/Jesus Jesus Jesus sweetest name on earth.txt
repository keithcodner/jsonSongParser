[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, sweetest name on earth; how can I, a sinner, come to know its worth?


[Verse 2] 
Oh! the sinful sorrow, oh! the strangest shame, that I saw no beauty in that sacred name.


[Verse 3] 
Never felt the sweetness, never knew the grace, never saw the love-pain in that wounded face!


[Verse 4] 
Never found the mystery in that simple word, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Saviour, Lover - Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Now â€˜tis past and over, gone my sin and shame, Jesus, Jesus did it, glory to His name!


[Verse 6] 
I have seen the glory of His tender face, I have felt with wonder, thrills of holy grace.


[Verse 7] 
Wonderful compassion reaching even me, bows my humbled spirit in captivity.


[Verse 8] 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, loved me in my shame, oh! the joy and rapture of that sacred name.
