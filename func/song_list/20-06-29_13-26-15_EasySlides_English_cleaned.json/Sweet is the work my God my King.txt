[Verse 1] 
Sweet is the work, my God, my King, to praise Thy name, give thanks and sing, to show Thy love by morning light, and talk of all Thy truth at night.


[Verse 2] 
Sweet is the day of sacred rest, no mortal cares disturb my breast; O may my heart in tune be found, like Davidâ€™s harp of solemn sound.


[Verse 3] 
My heart shall triumph in the Lord, and bless His works, and bless His word; Thy works of grace, how bright they shine, how deep Thy counsels, how divine!


[Verse 4] 
And I shall share a glorious part, when grace has well refined my heart, and fresh supplies of joy are shed, like holy oil, to cheer my head.


[Verse 5] 
Then shall I see and hear and know all I desired or wished below; and every power find sweet employ in that eternal world of joy.
