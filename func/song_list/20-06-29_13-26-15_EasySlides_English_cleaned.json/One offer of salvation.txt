[Verse 1] 
One offer of salvation, to all the world made known; the only sure foundation is Christ, the cornerstone.


[Verse 2] 
No other name is given, no other way is known; 'tis Jesus Christ, the first and last: he saves, and he alone!


[Verse 3] 
One only door of heaven stands open wide today; one sacrifice is given 'tis Christ, the Living Way.


[Verse 4] 
My only song and story is Jesus died for me; my only hope for glory the Cross of Calvary.
