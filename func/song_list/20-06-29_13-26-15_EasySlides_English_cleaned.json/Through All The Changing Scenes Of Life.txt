[Verse 1] 
Through all the changing scenes of life, In trouble and in joy, The praises of my God shall still My heart and tongue employ.


[Verse 2] 
Of His deliverance I will boast, Till all that are distressed From my example comfort take, And charm their griefs to rest.


[Verse 3] 
O magnify the Lord with me, With me exalt His name; When in distress to Him I called, He to my rescue came.


[Verse 4] 
The hosts of God encamp around The dwellings of the just; Deliverance He affords to all Who on His succour trust.


[Verse 5] 
O make but trial of His love; Experience will decide How blest are they, and only they, Who in His truth confide.


[Verse 6] 
Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then Have nothing else to fear; Make you His service your delight; Your wants shall be His care.
