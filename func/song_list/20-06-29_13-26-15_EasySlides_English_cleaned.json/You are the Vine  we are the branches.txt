[Verse 1] 
You are the Vine, we are the branches, keep us abiding in You. You are the Vine, we are the branches, keep us abiding in You. Then we'll grow in Your love, then we'll go in Your name, that the world will surely know that You have power to heal and to save. You are the Vine, we are the branches, keep us abiding in You.
