[Verse 1] 
The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want; He makes me down to lie In pastures green; He leadeth me The quiet waters by.


[Verse 2] 
My soul He doth restore again; And me to walk doth make Within the paths of righteousness, E'en for His own name's sake.


[Verse 3] 
Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale, Yet will I fear no ill; For Thou art with me; and Thy rod And staff me comfort still.


[Verse 4] 
My table Thou hast furnish√®d In presence of my foes; My head Thou dost with oil anoint, And my cup overflows.


[Verse 5] 
Goodness and mercy all my life Shall surely follow me; And in God's house forever more My dwelling place shall be.
