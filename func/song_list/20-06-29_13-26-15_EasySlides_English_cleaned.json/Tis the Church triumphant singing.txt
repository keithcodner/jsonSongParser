[Verse 1] 
‘Tis the Church triumphant singing, worthy the Lamb; heaven throughout with praises ringing, worthy the Lamb; thrones and powers before Him bending, odours sweet with voice ascending, swell the chorus never ending, worthy the Lamb.


[Verse 2] 
Every kindred, tongue, and nation, worthy the Lamb; join to sing the great salvation, worthy the Lamb. loud as mighty thunders roaring, floods of mighty waters pouring, prostrate at His feet adoring, worthy the Lamb.


[Verse 3] 
Harps and songs for ever sounding worthy the Lamb; mighty grace o’er sin abounding, worthy the Lamb. By His blood He dearly bought us; wandering from the fold He sought us, and to glory safely brought us; worthy the Lamb.


[Verse 4] 
Sing with blest anticipation, worthy the Lamb; through the vale of tribulation, worthy the Lamb. Sweetest notes, all notes excelling, on the theme for ever dwelling, still untold, though ever telling, worthy the Lamb.
