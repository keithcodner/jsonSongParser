[Verse 1] 
Come, thou fount of ev'ry blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace; streams of mercy, never ceasing, call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me some melodious sonnet, sung by flaming tongues above; praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, mount of thy redeeming love.


[Verse 2] 
O to grace, how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be, let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter, bind my wand'ring heart to thee. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love; here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it; seal it for thy courts above.
