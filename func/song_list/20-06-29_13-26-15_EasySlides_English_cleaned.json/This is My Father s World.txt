[Verse 1] 
This is my Father's world: And to my lis-t'ning ears All na-ture sings, and round me rings The mu-sic of the spheres This is my Father's world I rest me in the thought Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas- His hand the won-ders wrought


[Verse 2] 
This is my Father's world, The birds their car-ols raise, The morn-ing light, the lil-y white, De-clare their Mak-er's praise This is my Father's world: He shines in all that's fair; In the rus-tling grass, I hear Him pass, He speaks to me ev-'ry-where.


[Verse 3] 
This is my Father's world, O let me ne'er for-get That tho' the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the Rul-er yet. This is my Father's world: Why should my heart be sad? The Lord is King: let the heav-ens ring! God reigns: let earth be glad!
