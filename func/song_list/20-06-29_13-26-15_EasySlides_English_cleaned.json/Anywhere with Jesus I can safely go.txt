[Verse 1] 
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go, anywhere He leads me in this world below, anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade, anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.


[Verse 2] 
Anywhere! anywhere! fear I cannot know, anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.


[Verse 3] 
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone, other friends may fail me, He is still my own. Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways, anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.


[Verse 4] 
Anywhere! anywhere! fear I cannot know, anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.


[Verse 5] 
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep, when the darkling shadows round about me creep. Knowing I shall waken never more to roam. anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.


[Verse 6] 
Anywhere! anywhere! fear I cannot know, anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
