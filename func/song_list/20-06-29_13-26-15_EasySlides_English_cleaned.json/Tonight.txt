[Verse 1] 
Tonight, while all the world was sleeping, a light exploded in the skies. And then, as glory did surround us, a voice, an angel did appear!


[Verse 2] 
Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth all peace from heav'n! Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth all peace from heav'n!


[Verse 3] 
Afraid, we covered up our faces, amazed at what our ears did hear. Good news of joy for all the people - today a Saviour has appeared!


[Verse 4] 
Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth all peace from heav'n! Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth all peace from heav'n!


[Verse 5] 
And so to Bethlehem to find it all was true; despised and worthless shepherds, we were the first to know.


[Verse 6] 
Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth all peace from heav'n! Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth all peace from heav'n!
