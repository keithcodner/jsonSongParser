[Verse 1] 
I was once far away from the Saviour and as vile as a sinner could be; and I wondered if Christ the Redeemer could save a poor sinner like me.


[Verse 2] 
I wandered on in the darkness, not a ray of light could I see; and the thought filled my heart with sadness, there’s no hope for a sinner like me.


[Verse 3] 
And then, in that dark lonely hour, a voice sweetly whispered to me, saying, “Christ the Redeemer has power to save a poor sinner like thee.”


[Verse 4] 
I listened: and lo! ‘twas the Saviour that was speaking so kindly to me; I cried, “I’m the chief of sinners, Thou canst save a poor sinner like me!”


[Verse 5] 
I then fully trusted in Jesus; and oh, what a joy came to me! My heart was filled with His praises for saving a sinner like me.


[Verse 6] 
No longer in darkness I’m walking, for the light is now shining on me, and now unto others I’m telling how He saved a poor sinner like me.


[Verse 7] 
And when life’s journey is over, and I the dear Saviour shall see, I’ll praise Him for ever and ever,for saving a sinner like me.
