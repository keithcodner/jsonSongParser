You are forever in my life You see me through the seasons Cover me with Your hand And lead me in Your righteousness And I look to You And I wait in You


[Verse 2] 
I'll sing to You Lord a hymn of love For Your faithfulness ot me I'm carried in everlasting arms You'll never let me go, through it all


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah
