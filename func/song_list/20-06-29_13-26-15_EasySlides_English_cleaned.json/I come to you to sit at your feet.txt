[Verse 1] 
I come to you, to sit at your feet, I hear you call, I'm longing to meet you. I lift my face to you, and catch your eye, oh, how you satisfy.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, your love surrounds me. Jesus, your love completes me. There's nothing like it, there's nothing like it, there's nothing like the love of God.


[Verse 3] 
Now looking closer, I see the scars, stories of love, you paid the greatest price, so that I may have life. Thank you, my friend, you're showing me once again.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, your love surrounds me. Jesus, your love completes me. There's nothing like it, there's nothing like it, there's nothing like the love of God.


[Verse 5] 
No longer searching, I've found the One, just touched the surface, only begun; this love goes deeper than any I've known.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus, your love surrounds me. Jesus, your love completes me. There's nothing like it, there's nothing like it, there's nothing like the love of God.
