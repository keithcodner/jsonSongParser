[Verse 1] 
The Lord of heaven confess, on high His glory raise. Him let all angels bless, Him all His armies praise. Him glorify sun, moon, and stars; ye higher spheres, and cloudy sky.


[Verse 2] 
From God your beings are, Him therefore famous make; you all created were, when He the word but spake. and from that place, where fixed you be by His decree, you cannot pass.


[Verse 3] 
Praise God from earth below, ye dragons, and ye deeps: fire, hail, clouds, wind, and snow, whom in command He keeps. praise ye His name, hills great and small, trees low and tall; beasts wild and tame;


[Verse 4] 
O let God’s name be praised above both earth and sky; for He His saints hath raised and set their horn on high; even those that be of Israel’s race, near to His grace. The Lord praise ye.
