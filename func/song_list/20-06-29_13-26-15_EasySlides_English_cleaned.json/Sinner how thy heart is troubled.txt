[Verse 1] 
Sinner, how thy heart is troubled! God is coming very near; do not hide thy deep emotion, do not check that falling tear.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, be saved, His grace is free! Oh, be saved, He died for thee! Oh, be saved, He died for thee!


[Verse 3] 
Art thou waiting till the morrow? Thou may’st never see its light; come at once! accept His mercy: He is waiting - come tonight!


[Verse 4] 
Oh, be saved, His grace is free! Oh, be saved, He died for thee! Oh, be saved, He died for thee!


[Verse 5] 
With a lowly contrite spirit, kneeling at the Saviour’s feet, thou canst feel, this very moment, pardon - precious, pure, and sweet.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, be saved, His grace is free! Oh, be saved, He died for thee! Oh, be saved, He died for thee!


[Verse 7] 
Let the angels bear the tidings upward to the courts of heaven! Let them sing, with holy rapture, o’er another soul forgiven!


[Verse 8] 
Oh, be saved, His grace is free! Oh, be saved, He died for thee! Oh, be saved, He died for thee!
