[Verse 1] 
From every stormy wind that blows, from every swelling tide of woes, there is a calm, a sure retreat; ‘tis found beneath the Mercy seat.


[Verse 2] 
There is a place where Jesus sheds the oil of gladness on our heads; a place than all beside more sweet it is the blood-stained Mercy seat.


[Verse 3] 
There is a scene where spirits blend, where friend holds fellowship with friend; though scattered far, by faith we meet around one common Mercy seat.


[Verse 4] 
There, there, on eagle’s wings we soar, till sense and sin molest no more, and heaven comes down our souls to greet, and glory crowns the Mercy seat!
