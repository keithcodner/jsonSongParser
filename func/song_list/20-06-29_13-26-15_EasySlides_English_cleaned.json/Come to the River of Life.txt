[Verse 1] 
Come to the river of life You will find healing here Come to the river of life Come and drink freely here Come if your heart is searching Come if your soul is thirsty Draw near and drink of the mercy of Jesus Christ At the river of life


[Verse 2] 
There is a river whose streams make glad The city of God, the city of God So come if you're wounded or sad There is a river, there is a river


[Verse 3] 
Come to the river of life You will find healing here Come to the river of life Come and drink freely here Come if your heart is searching Come if your soul is thirsty Draw near and drink of the mercy of Jesus Christ At the river of life


[Verse 4] 
It flows from the land of eternal life Where there's no more sorrow and no more night Into the hearts that are lifted to Him Filling His children again and again


[Verse 5] 
Come to the river of life You will find healing here Come to the river of life Come and drink freely here Come if your heart is searching Come if your soul is thirsty Draw near and drink of the mercy of Jesus Christ At the river of life
