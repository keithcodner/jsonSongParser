[Verse 1] 
I need you more, more than yesterday, I need you more, more than words can say. I need you more than ever before, I need you, Lord, I need you, Lord.


[Verse 2] 
More than the air I breathe, more than the song I sing, more than the next heartbeat, more than anything. And, Lord, as time goes by, I'll be by your side 'cause I never want to go back to my old life.


[Verse 3] 
I need you more, more than yesterday, I need you more, more than words can say. I need you more than ever before, I need you, Lord, I need you, Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Right here in your presence is where I belong; this old broken heart has finally found a home and I'll never be alone.


[Verse 5] 
I need you more, more than yesterday, I need you more, more than words can say. I need you more than ever before, I need you, Lord, I need you, Lord.
