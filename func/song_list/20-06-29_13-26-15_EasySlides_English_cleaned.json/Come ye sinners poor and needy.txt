I will arise and go to Jesus, he will embrace me in his arms; in the arms of my dear Saviour, O, there are ten thousand charms.

Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome, God's free bounty glorify; true belief and true repentance, ev'ry grace that brings you nigh.

I will arise and go to Jesus, he will embrace me in his arms; in the arms of my dear Saviour, O, there are ten thousand charms.

I will arise . . .


[Verse 6] 
I will arise and go to Jesus, he will embrace me in his arms; in the arms of my dear Saviour, O, there are ten thousand charms.


[Verse 7] 
Let not conscience make you linger, nor of fitness fondly dream; all the fitness he requireth, is to feel you need of him.

Come, ye weary, heavy laden, lost and ruined by the fall; if you tarry till you're better, you will never come at all.

I will arise and go to Jesus, he will embrace me in his arms; in the arms of my dear Saviour, O, there are ten thousand charms.
