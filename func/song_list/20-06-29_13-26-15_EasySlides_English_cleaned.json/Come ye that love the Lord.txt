[Verse 1] 
Come, ye that love the Lord, and let your joys be known; join in a song with sweet accord, join in a song with sweet accord, and thus surround the throne, and thus surround the throne.


[Verse 2] 
We’re marching to Zion! Beautiful, beautiful Zion! We’re marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God!


[Verse 3] 
Let those refuse to sing who never knew our God; but children of the heavenly King, but children of the heavenly King must speak their joys abroad, must speak their joys abroad.


[Verse 4] 
We’re marching to Zion! Beautiful, beautiful Zion! We’re marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God!


[Verse 5] 
The hill of Zion yields a thousand sacred sweets, before we reach the heavenly fields, before we reach the heavenly fields or walk the golden streets, or walk the golden streets.


[Verse 6] 
We’re marching to Zion! Beautiful, beautiful Zion! We’re marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God!


[Verse 7] 
Then let our songs abound, and every tear be dry: we’re marching through Immanuel’s ground, we’re marching through Immanuel’s ground, to fairer worlds on high, to fairer worlds on high.


[Verse 8] 
We’re marching to Zion! Beautiful, beautiful Zion! We’re marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God!
