[Verse 1] 
Do you ever search your heart, As you watch the day depart. Is there something way down deep you try to hide? If this day should be the end, And eternity began, When the book is open wide, Would the Lord be satisfied?


[Verse 2] 
Is He satisfied? is He satisfied? Is He satisfied with me? Have I done my best, have I stood the test? Is He satisfied with me?   When my Lord shall come again, When He walks and talks with man, What if every friend He had were just like me?   Would He feel welcome here? Or would He go away in tears? Am I all that I should be? Is He satisfied with me?


[Verse 3] 
Feeble is the lamp of fame, By which man inscribes his name, On the walls of time for other men to see. Though he boast of wealth and power, None can help him in that hour, When the angels hear His plea, Is He satisfied with me.


[Verse 4] 
Is He satisfied? is He satisfied? Is He satisfied with me? Have I done my best, have I stood the test? Is He satisfied with me?   When my Lord shall come again, When He walks and talks with man, What if every friend He had were just like me?   Would He feel welcome here? Or would He go away in tears? Am I all that I should be? Is He satisfied with me?
