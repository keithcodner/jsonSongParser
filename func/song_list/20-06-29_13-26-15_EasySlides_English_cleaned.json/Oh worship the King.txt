[Verse 1] 
Oh, worship the King, all glorious above! Oh, gratefully sing His power and His love; our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days, pavilioned in splendour, and girded with praise.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, tell of His might, oh, sing of His grace! whose robe is the light, whose canopy space; His chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.


[Verse 3] 
Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light; it streams from the hills, it descends to the plain and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.


[Verse 4] 
Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, in Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail; Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end, our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, measureless Might, ineffable Love, while angels delight to hymn Thee above, Thy humbler creation, though feeble their lays, with true adoration shall sing to Thy praise.
