[Verse 1] 
The love of God is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell; it goes beyond the highest star, and reaches to the lowest hell: the guilty pair, bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win; His erring child He reconciled, and pardoned from his sin.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall for evermore endure, the saints’ and angels’ song.


[Verse 3] 
When hoary time shall pass away, and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall; when men who here refuse to pray, on rocks and hills and mountains call; God’s love, so sure, shall still endure, all measureless and strong; redeeming grace to Adam’s race the saints and angels song.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall for evermore endure, the saints’ and angels’ song.


[Verse 5] 
Could we with ink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made; were every stalk on earth a quill, and every man a scribe by trade; to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry; nor could the scroll contain the whole, though stretched from sky to sky.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall for evermore endure, the saints’ and angels’ song.
