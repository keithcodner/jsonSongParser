[Verse 1] 
I have a song that Jesus gave me, it was sent from heaven above; there never was a sweeter melody, ‘tis a melody of love.


[Verse 2] 
In my heart there rings a melody, there rings a melody with heaven’s harmony; in my heart there rings a melody; there rings a melody of love.


[Verse 3] 
I love the Christ that died on Calvary, for He washed my sins away; He put within my heart a melody, and I know it’s there to stay.


[Verse 4] 
In my heart there rings a melody, there rings a melody with heaven’s harmony; in my heart there rings a melody; there rings a melody of love.


[Verse 5] 
Twill be my endless theme in glory, with the angels I will sing; ‘twill be a song with glorious harmony, when the courts of heaven ring.


[Verse 6] 
In my heart there rings a melody, there rings a melody with heaven’s harmony; in my heart there rings a melody; there rings a melody of love.
