[Verse 1] 
In The Cross Jesus keep me near the cross, There a precious fountain, Free to all a healing stream, Flow's from Calvary's mountain.


[Verse 2] 
In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever, Till my ruptured soul shall find, Rest beyond the river.


[Verse 3] 
Near the cross, O Lamb of God, Bring its scene before me, Help me walk from day to day, With its shadows o'er me.


[Verse 4] 
In the cross, in the cross, Be my glory ever, Till my ruptured soul shall find, Rest beyond the river.
