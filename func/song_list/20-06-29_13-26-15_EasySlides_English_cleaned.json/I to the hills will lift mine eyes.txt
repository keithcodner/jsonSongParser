[Verse 1] 
I to the hills will lift mine eyes, from whence doth come mine aid? My safety cometh from the Lord, who heaven and earth hath made.


[Verse 2] 
Thy foot heâ€™ll not let slide, nor will He slumber that thee keeps. Behold, he that keeps Israel, He slumbers not, nor sleeps.


[Verse 3] 
The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade on thy right hand doth stay: the moon by night thee shall not smite, nor yet the sun by day.


[Verse 4] 
The Lord shall keep thy soul; he shall preserve thee from all ill. Henceforth thy going out and in God keep for ever will.


[Verse 5] 
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the God whom we adore, be glory, as it was, and is, and shall be evermore. Amen.
