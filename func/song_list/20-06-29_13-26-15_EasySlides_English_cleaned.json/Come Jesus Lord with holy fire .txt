[Verse 1] 
Come, Jesus, Lord, with holy fire! Come, and my quickened heart inspire, cleansed in Thy precious blood. Now to my soul Thyself reveal. Thy mighty working let me feel, since I am born of God.


[Verse 2] 
Let nothing now my heart divide; since with Thee I am crucified, and live to God in Thee. Dead to the world and all its toys, its idle pomp, and fading joys, Jesus my glory be!


[Verse 3] 
Me with a quenchless thirst inspire, a longing infinite desire, and fill my craving heart. Less than Thyself, oh, do not give, in might Thyself within me live, come, all Thou hast and art!


[Verse 4] 
My will be swallowed up in Thee, light in Thy light still may I see, in Thine unclouded face; called the full strength of trust to prove, let all my quickened heart be love, my spotless life be praise.
