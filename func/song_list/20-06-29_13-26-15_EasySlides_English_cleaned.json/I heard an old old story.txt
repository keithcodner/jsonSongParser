[Verse 1] 
I heard an old, old story, how a Saviour came from glory, how He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me. I heard about His groaning, of His precious blood's atoning. Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, victory in Jesus, my Saviour, forever! He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood. He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood.


[Verse 3] 
I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing, how He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see. And then I cried, “Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit”; and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, victory in Jesus, my Saviour, forever! He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood. He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood.


[Verse 5] 
I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory, and I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea; about the angels singing, and the old redemption story. And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, victory in Jesus, my Saviour, forever! He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood. He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him. He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood.
