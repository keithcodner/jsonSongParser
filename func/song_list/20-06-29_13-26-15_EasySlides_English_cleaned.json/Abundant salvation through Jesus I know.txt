[Verse 1] 
Abundant salvation through Jesus I know; rich streams of refreshing from Calvary flow; believing His word, with rejoicing I see the fountain of blessing is flowing for me!


[Verse 2] 
flowing for me, for me; the fountain of blessing is flowing for me.


[Verse 3] 
Alive evermore, He's a Saviour indeed, His fullness surpassing my uttermost need; His bounty is royal, exceeding my plea; the fountain of blessing is flowing for me!


[Verse 4] 
flowing for me, for me; the fountain of blessing is flowing for me.


[Verse 5] 
There's strength in temptation, the victory to gain; there's sunshine in darkness and comfort in pain; this plenteous redemption in Jesus is free; the fountain of blessing is flowing for me!


[Verse 6] 
flowing for me, for me; the fountain of blessing is flowing for me.


[Verse 7] 
The brightening waves of the river of peace and joy, fresh and sparkling, find happy increase: all honour and glory, dear Saviour to Thee! the fountain of blessing is flowing for me!


[Verse 8] 
flowing for me, for me; the fountain of blessing is flowing for me.
