[Verse 1] 
Come, let us to the Lord our God with contrite hearts return: our God is gracious, nor will leave the desolate to mourn.


[Verse 2] 
His voice commands the tempest forth, and stills the stormy wave; and though His arm be strong to smite, â€˜tis also strong to save.


[Verse 3] 
Long hath the night of sorrow reigned; the dawn shall bring us light; God shall appear, and we shall rise with gladness in His sight.


[Verse 4] 
Our hearts, if God we seek to know, shall know Him and rejoice; His coming like the morn shall be, like morning songs His voice.


[Verse 5] 
As dew upon the tender herb, diffusing fragrance round; as showers that usher in the spring, and cheer the thirsty ground:


[Verse 6] 
So shall His presence bless our souls, and shed a joyful light: that hallowed morn shall chase away the sorrows of the night.
