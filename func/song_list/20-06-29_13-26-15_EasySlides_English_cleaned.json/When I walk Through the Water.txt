[Verse 1] 
When I walk through the waters I will not drown. When I walk through the fire, I shall not be burned


[Verse 2] 
For you have redeemed me You've paid the full price And you've called me by name And You tell me that I'm Yours Because I'm precious in Your eyes


[Verse 3] 
When the floods overwhelm me You take my hand When I feel like I'm sinking You help me stand on solid ground


[Verse 4] 
For you have redeemed me You've paid the full price And you've called me by name And You tell me that I'm Yours Because I'm precious in Your eyes
