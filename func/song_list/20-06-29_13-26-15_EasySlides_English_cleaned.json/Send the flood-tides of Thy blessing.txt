[Verse 1] 
Send the flood-tides of Thy blessing! Pour exhaustless draughts of grace; in the spate of heavenly glory oh, my God, spare me a place. Come around us, o'er us, on us, fill our souls with holy fire, come in glory, stand among us! Oh my soul, to God aspire!


[Verse 2] 
Cleanse! Thou mighty flood-tide - cleanse me purer than the driven snow! Oh the precious blood doth reach me, His blessed cleansing now I know! God is here in matchless splendour, gone the glory of earth's sun, blinded by the vision glorious, Lord in me, Thy will be done.


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! God in majesty doth sweep, gushing forth a mighty torrent, o'er land and sea His power doth leap. Oh Thou Victor - ride in Triumph! Blood-bought riches Thou must claim, on till we with hosts of glory swell forever Thy mighty fame!
