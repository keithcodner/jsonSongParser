[Verse 1] 
Jesus, stand among us, In Thy risen power, Let this time of worship Be a hallowed hour.


[Verse 2] 
Breathe Thy Holy Spirit Into every heart, Bid the fears and sorrows From each soul depart.


[Verse 3] 
Thus with quickened footsteps We'll pursue our way, Watching for the dawning Of eternal day.
