[Verse 1] 
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever, I will sing, I will sing. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
With my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness. With my mouth will I make known Thy faithfulness to all generations.


[Verse 3] 
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever, I will sing, I will sing. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
