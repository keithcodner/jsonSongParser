[Verse 1] 
How great is God's love, sending his own son To live among us that we may see How great is his grace, standing in my place To carry my sin at Calvary   How high the heavens are, from east to west how far The whole creation O Lord I see Yet still you know my name, and took away my shame Your love O Father a mystery
