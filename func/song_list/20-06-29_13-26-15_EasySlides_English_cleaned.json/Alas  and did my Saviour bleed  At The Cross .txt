[Verse 1] 
Alas! and did my Saviour bleed and did my Sov'reign die? Would he devote that sacred head for sinners such as I?


[Verse 2] 
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day!


[Verse 3] 
Was it for crimes that I have done he groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree!


[Verse 4] 
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day!


[Verse 5] 
But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I owe: here, Lord, I give myself away, 'tis all that I can do!


[Verse 6] 
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day!
