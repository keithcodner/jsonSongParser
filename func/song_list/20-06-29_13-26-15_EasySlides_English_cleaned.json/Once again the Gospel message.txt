[Verse 1] 
Once again the Gospel message from the Saviour you have heard; Will you heed the invitation? Will you turn and seek the Lord?


[Verse 2] 
Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live! Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live!


[Verse 3] 
Many summers you have wasted, ripened harvests you have seen; winter snows by spring have melted, yet you linger in your sin.


[Verse 4] 
Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live! Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live!


[Verse 5] 
Jesus for your choice is waiting; tarry not; at once decide! While the Spirit now is striving, yield, and seek the Saviour’s side.


[Verse 6] 
Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live! Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live!


[Verse 7] 
Cease of fitness to be thinking; do not longer try to feel! It is trusting, and not feeling, that will give the Spirit’s seal.


[Verse 8] 
Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live! Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live!


[Verse 9] 
Let your will to God be given, trust in Christ’s atoning blood; look to Jesus now in heaven, rest on His unchanging word.


[Verse 10] 
Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live! Come believing! come believing! Come to Jesus! look and live!
