I will declare my choice to the nations Shout for joy in the congregation I will worship God, worship God All my days… Those who love the Lord are satisfied Those who trust in Him are justified I will serve my God, serve my God All my days…

MEN: When the nations crumble WOMEN: The word of the Lord will stand MEN: Kings may rise and fall WOMEN: His love will endure MEN: Though the strong may stumble WOMEN: Ah the joy of the Lord is strength ALL: To my soul   I will not be shaken I will not be moved! I will not be shaken ALL: To my soul I will not be shaken I will not be moved!!! I will not be shaken
