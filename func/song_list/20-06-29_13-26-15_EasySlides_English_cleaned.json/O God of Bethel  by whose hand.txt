[Verse 1] 
O God of Bethel! by whose hand Thy people still are fed; who through this weary pilgrimage hast all our fathers led:


[Verse 2] 
Our vows, our prayers, we now present before Thy throne of grace: God of our fathers! be the God of their succeeding race.


[Verse 3] 
Through each perplexing path of life our wandering footsteps guide; give us each day our daily bread, and raiment fit provide.


[Verse 4] 
O spread Thy covering wings around, till all our wanderings cease, and at our Fatherâ€™s loved abode our souls arrive in peace.


[Verse 5] 
Such blessings from Thy gracious hand our humble prayers implore; and Thou shalt be our chosen God, and portion evermore.
