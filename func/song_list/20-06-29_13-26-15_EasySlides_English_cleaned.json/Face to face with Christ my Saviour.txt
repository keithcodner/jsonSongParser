[Verse 1] 
Face to face with Christ my Saviour, face to face: what will it be when with rapture I behold Him, Jesus Christ who died for me?


[Verse 2] 
Face to face shall I behold Him, far beyond the starry sky; face to face in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!


[Verse 3] 
Only faintly now I see Him, with the darkling veil between, but a blessed day is coming, when His glory shall be seen.


[Verse 4] 
Face to face shall I behold Him, far beyond the starry sky; face to face in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!


[Verse 5] 
What rejoicing in His presence, when are banished grief and pain; when the crooked ways are straightened and the dark things shall be plain.


[Verse 6] 
Face to face shall I behold Him, far beyond the starry sky; face to face in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!


[Verse 7] 
Face to face! O blissful moment! Face to face, to see and know! Face to face with my Redeemer, Jesus Christ who loves me so.


[Verse 8] 
Face to face shall I behold Him, far beyond the starry sky; face to face in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!
