[Verse 1] 
O Spirit of the living God, in all Thy plentitude of grace, where’er the foot of man hath trod, descend on our apostate race.


[Verse 2] 
Give tongues of fire and hearts of love to preach the reconciling word; give power and unction from above, whene’er the joyful sound is heard.


[Verse 3] 
Be darkness, at Thy coming, light; confusion, order in Thy path; souls without strength inspire with might bid mercy triumph over wrath.


[Verse 4] 
O Spirit of the Lord, prepare all the round earth her God to meet; breathe Thou abroad like morning air, till hearts of stone begin to beat.


[Verse 5] 
Baptize the nations; far and nigh the triumphs of the cross record; the Name of Jesus glorify till every kindred call Him Lord.


[Verse 6] 
God from eternity hath willed all flesh shall His salvation see; so be the Father’s love fulfilled, the Saviour’s sufferings crowned through Thee.
