[Verse 1] 
Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blessed, with healing gifts for souls distressed, to find in Thee my Life, my Rest, Christ crucified, I come.


[Verse 2] 
Weary of selfishness and pride, false pleasures gone, vain hopes denied, deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide, Christ crucified, I come.


[Verse 3] 
Wash me, and take away each stain, let nothing of my sin remain; for cleansing, though it be through pain, Christ crucified, I come.


[Verse 4] 
A life of labour, prayers and love, which shall my heart's conversion prove, till to a glorious rest above, Christ crucified, I come.


[Verse 5] 
To share with Thee Thy Life divine, Thy Righteousness, Thy Likeness mine, since Thou hast made my nature Thine, Christ crucified, I come.


[Verse 6] 
To be what Thou woulds't have me be, accepted, sanctified in Thee, through what Thy grace shall work in me, Christ crucified, I come.
