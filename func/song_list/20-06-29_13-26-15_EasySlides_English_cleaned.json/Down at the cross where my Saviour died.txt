[Verse 1] 
Down at the cross where my Saviour died, down where for cleansing from sin I cried, there to my heart was the blood applied; glory to His name!


[Verse 2] 
Glory to His name! Glory to His name! Now to my heart is the blood applied; Glory to His name!


[Verse 3] 
I am so wondrously saved from sin, Jesus so sweetly abides within, here at the cross where He took me in; glory to His name!


[Verse 4] 
Glory to His name! Glory to His name! Now to my heart is the blood applied; Glory to His name!


[Verse 5] 
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin, I am so glad I have entered in; here Jesus saves me and keeps me clean; glory to His name!


[Verse 6] 
Glory to His name! Glory to His name! Now to my heart is the blood applied; Glory to His name!


[Verse 7] 
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet, cast thy poor soul at the Saviourâ€™s feet, plunge in today and be made complete; glory to His name!


[Verse 8] 
Glory to His name! Glory to His name! Now to my heart is the blood applied; Glory to His name!
