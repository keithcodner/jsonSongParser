[Verse 1] 
You are the rock of my salvation, You are the strength of my life, You are my hope and my inspiration, Lord unto You will I cry.


[Verse 2] 
You are the rock of my salvation, You are the strength of my life, You are my hope and my inspiration, Lord unto You will I cry.


[Verse 3] 
I believe in You, Believe in You, For Your faithful love to me, You have been my help in time of need, Lord unto You will I cleave.
