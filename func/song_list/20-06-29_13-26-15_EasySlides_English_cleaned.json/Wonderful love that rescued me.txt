[Verse 1] 
Wonderful love that rescued me, sunk deep in sin, guilty and vile as I could be, no hope within; when every ray of light had fled, O glorious day, raising my soul from out the dead, love found a way.


[Verse 2] 
Love found a way to redeem my soul, love found a way that could make me whole; love sent my Lord to the cross of shame, love found a way, O praise His holy name!


[Verse 3] 
Love brought my Saviour here to die on Calvary, for such a sinful wretch as I, how can it be? Love bridged the gulf ‘twixt me and heaven, taught me to pray; I am redeemed, set free, forgiven, love found a way.


[Verse 4] 
Love found a way to redeem my soul, love found a way that could make me whole; love sent my Lord to the cross of shame, love found a way, O praise His holy name!


[Verse 5] 
Love opened wide the gates of light to heaven’s domain. where in eternal power and might Jesus shall reign; love lifted me from depths of woe to endless day, there was no help in earth below, love found a way.


[Verse 6] 
Love found a way to redeem my soul, love found a way that could make me whole; love sent my Lord to the cross of shame, love found a way, O praise His holy name!
