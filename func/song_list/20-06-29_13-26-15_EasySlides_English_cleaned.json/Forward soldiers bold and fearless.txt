[Verse 1] 
Forward, soldiers, bold and fearless, hear the call of God; prove your courage in the conflict, tread where brave men trod.


[Verse 2] 
Lift aloft the cross of Jesus! Hold it high and strong; sound the praise of Him who saves us, swell the battle song!


[Verse 3] 
Faith our shield, and hope our helmet, Satan’s host we face; marshalled in the might of Jesus, win we by His grace.


[Verse 4] 
Lift aloft the cross of Jesus! Hold it high and strong; sound the praise of Him who saves us, swell the battle song!


[Verse 5] 
Catch the order of our Captain, wield the Spirit’s sword; onward, fearless, press to conquer, slaying with His word.


[Verse 6] 
Lift aloft the cross of Jesus! Hold it high and strong; sound the praise of Him who saves us, swell the battle song!


[Verse 7] 
Sharers in the glad hosanna, all who will believe. They who joyful bear His banner, crowns of life receive.


[Verse 8] 
Lift aloft the cross of Jesus! Hold it high and strong; sound the praise of Him who saves us, swell the battle song!
