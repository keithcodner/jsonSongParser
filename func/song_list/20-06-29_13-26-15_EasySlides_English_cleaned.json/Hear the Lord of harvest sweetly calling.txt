[Verse 1] 
Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly calling, “Who will go and work for Me to-day? Who will bring to Me the lost and dying? Who will point them to the narrow way?”


[Verse 2] 
Speak, my Lord, speak to me, Speak, and I'll be quick to answer Thee; Speak, my Lord, speak to me, Speak, and I will answer, “Lord, send me.”


[Verse 3] 
When the coal of fire touched the prophet, making him as pure, as pure can be, when the voice of God said, “Who'll go for us?” then he answered, “Here I am, send me.”


[Verse 4] 
Millions now in sin and shame are dying; listen to their sad and bitter cry; hasten, brother, hasten to the rescue; quickly answer, “Master, here am I.”


[Verse 5] 
Soon the time for reaping will be over; soon we'll gather for the harvest-home; may the Lord of harvest smile upon us, may we hear His blessed, “Child, well done!”
