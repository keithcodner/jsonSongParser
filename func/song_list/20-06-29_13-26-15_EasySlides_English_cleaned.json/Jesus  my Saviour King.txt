[Verse 1] 
Jesus, my Saviour King, I will be Thine! Only to Thee I cling; I will be Thine! Mine not the worldling's gain, mine not his pleasures vain! Man's honours I disdain - I will be Thine!


[Verse 2] 
Let others seek their own, I will be Thine! I'll live for Thee alone! I will be Thine! Riches and earthly fame, each mean or selfish aim, forever I disclaim, - I will be Thine!


[Verse 3] 
Whate'er Thou wilt I'll do; I will be Thine! Gladly I'll suffer too; I will be Thine! Only possess my heart, bid sin and fear depart. Oh, let us never part! I will be Thine!
