[Verse 1] 
Down from His glory, ever-living story, my God and Saviour came, and Jesus was His name; born in a manger, to His own a stranger, a man of sorrows, tears and agony!


[Verse 2] 
O how I love Him! how I adore Him! My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all! The great Creator became my Saviour, and all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him!


[Verse 3] 
What condescension, bringing us redemption, that in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight; God, gracious, tender, laid aside His splendour, stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.


[Verse 4] 
O how I love Him! how I adore Him! My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all! The great Creator became my Saviour, and all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him!


[Verse 5] 
Without reluctance, flesh and blood, His substance, He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan; O glorious mystery, sacrifice of Calvary! And now I know He is the great ‘I AM’!


[Verse 6] 
O how I love Him! how I adore Him! My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all! The great Creator became my Saviour, and all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him!
