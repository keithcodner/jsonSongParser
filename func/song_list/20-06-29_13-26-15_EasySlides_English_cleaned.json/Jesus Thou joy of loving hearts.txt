[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts, Thou fount of life, Thou light of men! From the best bliss that earth imparts we turn unfilled to Thee again.


[Verse 2] 
Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood; Thou savest those that on Thee call; to them that seek Thee, Thou art good, to them that find Thee, All in all!


[Verse 3] 
We taste Thee, O Thou living bread, and long to feast upon Thee still; we drink of Thee, the fountain head, and thirst our souls from Thee to fill.


[Verse 4] 
Our restless spirits yearn for Thee; where’er our changeful lot is cast, glad when Thy gracious smile we see, blest when our faith can hold Thee fast.


[Verse 5] 
O Jesus, ever with us stay! Make all our moments calm and bright; chase the dark night of sin away: shed o’er the world Thy holy light.
