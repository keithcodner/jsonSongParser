[Verse 1] 
Help me to hear, as Jesus heard, cries of the lost and lonely; help me to live, as Jesus lived, having one purpose only; help me to see, as Jesus saw, multitudes faint and dying; help me to pray, to give, to go, but always on Him relying!


[Verse 2] 
Help me to love, as Jesus loved, all of my heart outpouring; help me to feel, as Jesus felt, always the cost ignoring. Help me to do, as Jesus did, spend myself without measure, finding in Him a full reward, since He is my only treasure.


[Verse 3] 
Help me to seek, as Jesus sought, hearts that are cold and dreary; help me to bring, as Jesus brought, comfort to all the weary; living to manifest His grace, telling the old, old story, kept in His fellowship divine, yes, all the way home to glory!
