[Verse 1] 
Child in the manger, infant of Mary, outcast and stranger, Lord of all! Child who inherits all out transgressions, all our demerits on Him fall.


[Verse 2] 
Once the most holy child of salvation gentle and lowly lived below: now as our glorious mighty Redeemer, see Him victorious over each foe.


[Verse 3] 
Prophets foretold Him, infant of wonder; angels behold Him on His throne: worthy our Saviour of all their praises; happy for ever are His own.
