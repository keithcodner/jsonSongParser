[Verse 1] 
Lord we need Your grace and mercy, We need to pray like never before, We need the power of Your holy Spirit, To open heaven's door.


[Verse 2] 
Spirit, touch Your church, Stir the hearts of men, Revive us Lord, With Your passion once again, I want to care for others, Like Jesus cares for me, Let Your rain fall upon me, Let Your rain fall upon me.


[Verse 3] 
Lord we humbly come before You, We don't deserve of You what we ask, But we yearn to see Your glory, Restore this dying land.


[Verse 4] 
Spirit, touch Your church, Stir the hearts of men, Revive us Lord, With Your passion once again, I want to care for others, Like Jesus cares for me, Let Your rain fall upon me, Let Your rain fall upon me.
