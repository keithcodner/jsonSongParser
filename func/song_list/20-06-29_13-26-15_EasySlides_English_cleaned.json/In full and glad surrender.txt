[Verse 1] 
In full and glad surrender, I give myself to Thee, Thine utterly and only and evermore to be.


[Verse 2] 
O Son of God, who lovest me, I will be Thine alone; and all I have and am, Lord, shall henceforth by Thine own!


[Verse 3] 
Reign over me, Lord Jesus, O make my heart Thy throne; it shall be Thine, dear Saviour, it shall be Thine alone.


[Verse 4] 
O come and reign, Lord Jesus, rule over everything! and keep me always loyal and true to Thee, my King.
