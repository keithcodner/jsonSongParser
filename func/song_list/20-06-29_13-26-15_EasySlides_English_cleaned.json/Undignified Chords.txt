[Verse 1] 
I will dance and I will sing to be mad for my king Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul (x2) 


[Verse 2] 
I'll become even more undignified than this Some say its foolishness I'll become even more undignified than this Leave my pride by my side 


[Verse 3] 
Na, na, na, na, na, na hey! Na, na, na, na, na, na hey!
