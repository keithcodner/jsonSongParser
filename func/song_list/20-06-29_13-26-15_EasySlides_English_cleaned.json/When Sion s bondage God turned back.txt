[Verse 1] 
When Sion's bondage God turned back, as men that dreamed were we. Then filled with laughter was our mouth, our tongue with melody.   They among the heathen said, The Lord great things for them hath wrought. The Lord hath done great things for us, whence joy to us is brought.   As streams of water in the south, our bondage, Lord, recall. Who sow in tears, a reaping time of joy enjoy they shall.   That man who, bearing precious seed, in going forth doth mourn, He doubtless, bringing back his sheaves, rejoicing shall return.
