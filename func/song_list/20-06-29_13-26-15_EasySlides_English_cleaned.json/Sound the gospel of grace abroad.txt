[Verse 1] 
Sound the gospel of grace abroad, there’s life in the risen Lord! Spread the news of the gift of God, there’s life in the risen Lord! God above desires it! Sinful man requires it!


[Verse 2] 
Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord. Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord.


[Verse 3] 
All by nature are doomed to die, so saith the holy word; welcome therefore the joyful cry, there’s life in the risen Lord! Welcome news of gladness - antidote for sadness.


[Verse 4] 
Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord. Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord.


[Verse 5] 
Saints, apostles, and prophets all published with one accord, this deliverance from the fall, this life in the risen Lord. Glory be to Jesus, who from bondage frees us!


[Verse 6] 
Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord. Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord.


[Verse 7] 
Pardon, power, and perfect peace the words of this life afford, never then let the tidings cease, of life in the risen Lord. Open wide the portal unto every mortal.


[Verse 8] 
Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord. Tell it around, let it abound, there’s life in the risen Lord.
