[Verse 1] 
Full Salvation! full Salvation! lo! the fountain opened wide streams through every land and nation from the Saviour's wounded side. Full Salvation! Full Salvation! Full Salvation! Full Salvation! Streams an endless crimson tide.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, the glorious revelation! See the cleansing current flow, washing stains of condemnation whiter than the driven snow! Full Salvation! Oh! the rapturous bliss to know!


[Verse 3] 
Love's resistless current sweeping all the regions deep within; thought and wish and senses keeping now, and every instant, clean. Full Salvation! from the guilt and power of sin.


[Verse 4] 
Life immortal, heaven descending, lo! my heart the Spirit's shrine! God and man in oneness blending, oh, what fellowship is mine! Full Salvation! Raised in Christ to life divine!


[Verse 5] 
Care and doubting, gloomy sorrow, fear and grief are mine no more; faith knows naught of dark tomorrow for my Saviour goes before. Full Salvation! full and free for evermore.
