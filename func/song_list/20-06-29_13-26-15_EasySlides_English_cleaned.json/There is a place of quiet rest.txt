[Verse 1] 
There is a place of quiet rest, near to the heart of God; a place where sin cannot molest, near to the heart of God.


[Verse 2] 
O Jesus, blest Redeemer, sent from the heart of God; hold us, who wait before Thee, near to the heart of God.


[Verse 3] 
There is a place of comfort sweet, near to the heart of God; a place where we our Saviour meet, near to the heart of God.


[Verse 4] 
O Jesus, blest Redeemer, sent from the heart of God; hold us, who wait before Thee, near to the heart of God.


[Verse 5] 
There is a place of full release, near to the heart of God; a place where all is joy and peace, near to the heart of God.


[Verse 6] 
O Jesus, blest Redeemer, sent from the heart of God; hold us, who wait before Thee, near to the heart of God.
