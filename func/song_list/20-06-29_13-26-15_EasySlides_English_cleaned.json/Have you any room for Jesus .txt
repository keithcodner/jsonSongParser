[Verse 1] 
Have you any room for Jesus? He who bore your load of sin, as He knocks and asks admission, sinner, will you let Him in?


[Verse 2] 
Room for Jesus, King of glory! Hasten now, His word obey, swing your heart’s door widely open, bid Him enter while you may.


[Verse 3] 
Room for pleasure, room for business, but for Christ, the crucified, not a place that He can enter, in your heart for which He died?


[Verse 4] 
Room for Jesus, King of glory! Hasten now, His word obey, swing your heart’s door widely open, bid Him enter while you may.


[Verse 5] 
Have you any time for Jesus, as in grace He calls again? Oh, today is time accepted, tomorrow you may call in vain.


[Verse 6] 
Room for Jesus, King of glory! Hasten now, His word obey, swing your heart’s door widely open, bid Him enter while you may.


[Verse 7] 
Room and time now give to Jesus, soon will pass God’s day of grace; soon your heart be cold and silent, and your Saviour’s pleadings cease.


[Verse 8] 
Room for Jesus, King of glory! Hasten now, His word obey, swing your heart’s door widely open, bid Him enter while you may.
