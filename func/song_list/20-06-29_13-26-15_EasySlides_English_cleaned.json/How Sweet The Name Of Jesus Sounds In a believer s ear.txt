[Verse 1] 
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds In a believer's ear; It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, And drives away his fear. It makes the wounded spirit whole, And calms the troubled breast; 'Tis manna to the hungry soul And to the weary, rest, And to the weary, rest.


[Verse 2] 
Dear name, the Rock on which I build, My shield, and hiding place; My never failing treasury, filled With boundless stores of grace. Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend, My Prophet, Priest, and King; My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, Accept the praise I bring, Accept the praise I bring.


[Verse 3] 
Weak is the effort of my heart, And cold my warmest thought; But when I see You as You are, I'll praise You as I ought. I would Your boundless love proclaim With every fleeting breath; So shall the music of Your name Refresh my soul in death, Refresh my soul in death.
