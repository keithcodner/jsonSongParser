[Verse 1] 
He who would valiant be 'Gainst all disaster, Let him in constancy Follow the Master. There's no discouragement Shall make him once relent His first avowed intent To be a pilgrim.


[Verse 2] 
Who so beset him round With dismal stories, Do but themselves confound- His strength the more is. No foes shall stay his might, Though he with giants fight; He will make good his right To be a pilgrim.


[Verse 3] 
Since, Lord, Thou dost defend Us with Thy Spirit, We know we at the end Shall life inherit. Then fancies flee away! I'll fear not what men say, I'll labour night and day To be a pilgrim.
