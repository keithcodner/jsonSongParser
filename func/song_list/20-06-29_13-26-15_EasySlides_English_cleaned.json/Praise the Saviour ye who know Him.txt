[Verse 1] 
Praise the Saviour, ye who know Him; who can tell how much we owe Him? Gladly let us render to Him all we have and are.


[Verse 2] 
“Jesus” is the name that charms us; He for conflicts fits and arms us; nothing moves and nothing harms us, when we trust in Him.


[Verse 3] 
Trust in Him, ye saints for ever; He is faithful, changing never; neither force nor guile can sever those He loves from Him.


[Verse 4] 
Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving to Thyself and still believing, till the hour of our receiving promised joys in heaven.
