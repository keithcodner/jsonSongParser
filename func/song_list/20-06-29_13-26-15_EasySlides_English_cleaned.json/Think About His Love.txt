[Verse 1] 
Think about His love, Think about His goodness, Think about His grace, That's bought us through, For as high as the heaven's above, So great is the measure of our Father's love, Great is the measure of our Father's love.


[Verse 2] 
How could I forget His love? How could I forget His mercy? He satisfies, He satisfies, He satisfies my desires. Great is the measure of our Father's love.


[Verse 3] 
Think about His love, Think about His goodness, Think about His grace, That's bought us through, For as high as the heaven's above, So great is the measure of our Father's love, Great is the measure of our Father's love.


[Verse 4] 
Even when I've strayed away, His love has sought me out and found me, He satisfies, He satisfies, He satisfies my desire. Great is the measure of our Father's love.


[Verse 5] 
Think about His love, Think about His goodness, Think about His grace, That's bought us through, For as high as the heaven's above, So great is the measure of our Father's love, Great is the measure of our Father's love.
