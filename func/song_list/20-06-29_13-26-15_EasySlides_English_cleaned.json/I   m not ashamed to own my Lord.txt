[Verse 1] 
I’m not ashamed to own my Lord, or to defend His cause; maintain the glory of His cross and honour all His laws.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, my Lord! I know His name, His name is all my boast; nor will He put my soul to shame, nor let my hope be lost.


[Verse 3] 
I know that safe with Him remains, protected by His power, what I’ve committed to His hands till the decisive hour.


[Verse 4] 
Then will He own His servant’s name before His Father’s face; and, in the new Jerusalem, appoint my soul a place.   (Chorus for Tune 2) At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light, and the burden of my heart rolled away, it was there by faith I received my sight, and now I am happy all the day.
