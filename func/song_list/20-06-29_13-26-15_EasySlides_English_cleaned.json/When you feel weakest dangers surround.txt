[Verse 1] 
When you feel weakest, dangers surround, subtle temptations, troubles abound, nothing seems hopeful, nothing seems glad, all is despairing, even-time sad.


[Verse 2] 
Keep on believing, Jesus is near, keep on believing, there’s nothing to fear; keep on believing, this is the way, faith in the night, as well as the day.


[Verse 3] 
If all were easy, if all were bright, where would the cross be? Where would the fight? But in the hardness, God gives to you chances of proving that you are true.


[Verse 4] 
Keep on believing, Jesus is near, keep on believing, there’s nothing to fear; keep on believing, this is the way, faith in the night, as well as the day.


[Verse 5] 
God is your Wisdom, God is your Might, God’s ever near you, guiding you right; He understands you, knows all you need; trusting in Him you’ll surely succeed.


[Verse 6] 
Keep on believing, Jesus is near, keep on believing, there’s nothing to fear; keep on believing, this is the way, faith in the night, as well as the day.


[Verse 7] 
Let us press on, then, never despair, live above feeling, victory’s there; Jesus can keep us so near to Him that nevermore our faith shall grow dim.


[Verse 8] 
Keep on believing, Jesus is near, keep on believing, there’s nothing to fear; keep on believing, this is the way, faith in the night, as well as the day.
