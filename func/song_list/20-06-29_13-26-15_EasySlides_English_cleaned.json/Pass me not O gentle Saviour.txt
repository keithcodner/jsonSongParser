[Verse 1] 
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour, hear my humble cry; while on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.


[Verse 2] 
Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry; while on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.


[Verse 3] 
Let me, at Thy throne of mercy find a sweet relief; kneeling there in deep contrition, help my unbelief.


[Verse 4] 
Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry; while on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.


[Verse 5] 
Trusting only in Thy merit would I seek Thy face; heal my wounded, broken spirit, save me by Thy grace.


[Verse 6] 
Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry; while on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.


[Verse 7] 
Thou the spring of all my comfort, more than life to me - whom have I on earth beside Thee? Whom in heaven but Thee?


[Verse 8] 
Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry; while on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.
