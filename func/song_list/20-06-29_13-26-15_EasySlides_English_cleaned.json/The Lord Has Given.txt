[Verse 1] 
The Lord has given a land of good things, I will press in and make them mine. I'll know His power, I'll know His glory, And in His kingdom I will shine.


[Verse 2] 
With the high praises of God in our mouth And a two-edged sword in our hand, We'll march right on to the victory side, Right into Canaan's land.


[Verse 3] 
Gird up your armour, ye sons of Zion, Gird up your armour, let's go to war. We'll win the battle with great rejoicing, And so we'll praise Him more and more.


[Verse 4] 
With the high praises of God in our mouth And a two-edged sword in our hand, We'll march right on to the victory side, Right into Canaan's land.


[Verse 5] 
We'll bind their kings in chains and fetters, We'll bind their nobles tight in iron, To execute God's written judgement; March on to glory, sons of Zion!


[Verse 6] 
With the high praises of God in our mouth And a two-edged sword in our hand, We'll march right on to the victory side, Right into Canaan's land.
