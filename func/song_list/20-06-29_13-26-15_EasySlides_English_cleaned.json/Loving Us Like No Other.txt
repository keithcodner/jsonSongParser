[Verse 1] 
Loving us like no other Hear our prayer The cry of our hearts As we come to You   We acknowledge our transgressions We confess to You our sins Show us mercy and compassion Touch our lives With Your healing grace again.


[Verse 2] 
Release us from our past As we seek Your face Wash us free as last We receive Your love   We receive Your healing grace We receive Your love We receive Your healing grace Touch our lives With Your healing grace again Touch our lives With Your healing grace again
