[Verse 1] 
Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe. Doing exactly as the Lord commands, doing it happily. Action is the key, do it immediately, joy you will receive. Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe. O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E. Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.


[Verse 2] 
We want to live pure, we want to live `clean, we want to do our best. Sweetly submitting to authority, leaving to God the rest. Walking in the light, keeping our attitude right, on the narrow way. For if we believe the Word we receive, we always will obey. O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E. Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.
