[Verse 1] 
Come, Thou everlasting Spirit, bring to every thankful mind all the Saviourâ€™s dying merit, all His sufferings for mankind: true Recorder of His passion, now the living faith impart; now reveal His great salvation unto every faithful heart.


[Verse 2] 
Come, Thou witness of His dying; come, Remembrancer divine; let us feel Thy power applying Christ to every soul, and mine; let us groan Thine inward groaning, look on Him we pierced, and grieve; all partake the grace atoning, all the sprinkled blood receive.


[Verse 3] 
Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth; I in Him, and He in me! And my empty soul He filleth, here and through eternity. Thus I wait for His returning, singing all the way to heaven; such the joyous song of morning, such the banquet song of even.
