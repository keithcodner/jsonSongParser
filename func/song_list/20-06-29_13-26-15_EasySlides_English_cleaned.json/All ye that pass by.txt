[Verse 1] 
All ye that pass by, to Jesus draw nigh; to you is it nothing that Jesus should die? Your ransom and peace, your surety he is: come, see if there ever was sorrow like his.


[Verse 2] 
He dies to atone for sins not his own; your debt he hath paid, and your work he hath done. Ye all may receive the peace he did leave, who made intercession: my Father, forgive!


[Verse 3] 
For you and for me he prayed on the tree: the pray'r is accepted, the sinner is free. That sinner am I, who on Jesus rely, and come for the pardon God cannot deny.


[Verse 4] 
My pardon I claim; for a sinner I am, a sinner believing in Jesus's name. He purchased the grace which now I embrace: O Father, thou know'st he hath died in my place.
