[Verse 1] 
How lovely is Thy dwelling-place, O Lord of hosts, to me! The tabernacles of Thy grace How pleasant, Lord, they be!


[Verse 2] 
My thirsty soul longs vehemently, Yea faints, Thy courts to see: My very heart and flesh cry out, O living God, for Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Behold, the sparrow findeth out An house wherein to rest; the swallow also for herself hath purchased a nest;


[Verse 4] 
Eâ€™en Thine own altars, where she safe her young ones forth may bring, O Thou almighty Lord of hosts, who art my God and King.


[Verse 5] 
Blest are they in Thy house that dwell, they ever give Thee praise. Blest is the man whose strength Thou art, in whose heart are Thy ways.


[Verse 6] 
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the God whom we adore, be glory, as it was, and is, and shall be evermore. Amen.
