[Verse 1] 
Nevertheless continually, O Lord, I am with Thee: Thou dost me hold by my right hand, and still upholdest me.


[Verse 2] 
Thou, with Thy counsel, while I live, wilt me conduct and guide; and to Thy glory afterwards receive me to abide.


[Verse 3] 
Whom have I in the heavens high but Thee, O Lord, alone? and in the earth whom I desire besides Thee is none.


[Verse 4] 
My flesh and heart doth faint and fail, but God doth fail me never: for of my heart God is the strength and portion forever.


[Verse 5] 
For, lo, they that are far from Thee for ever perish shall; Them that a whoring from thee go thou hast destroyed all.


[Verse 6] 
But surely it is good for me that I draw near to God: In God I trust, that all my works I may declare abroad.
