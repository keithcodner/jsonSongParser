[Verse 1] 
O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, this is my constant longing and prayer; gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures, Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.


[Verse 2] 
O to be like Thee, O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fulness: stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.


[Verse 3] 
O to be like Thee, full of compassion, loving, forgiving, tender and kind, helping the helpless, cheering the fainting, seeking the wandering sinner to find.


[Verse 4] 
O to be like Thee, O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fulness: stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.


[Verse 5] 
O to be like Thee, lowly in spirit, holy and harmless, patient and brave; meekly enduring cruel reproaches, willing to suffer, others to save.


[Verse 6] 
O to be like Thee, O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fulness: stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.


[Verse 7] 
O to be like Thee, Lord, I am coming, now to receive the anointing divine, all that I am and have I am bringing, Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.


[Verse 8] 
O to be like Thee, O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fulness: stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.


[Verse 9] 
O to be like Thee, while I am pleading, pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love, make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling, fit me for life and heaven above.


[Verse 10] 
O to be like Thee, O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fulness: stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
