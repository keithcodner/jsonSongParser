[Verse 1] 
Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings! Be Thou Thyself the answer to all my questionings. Live out Thy life within me, in all things have Thy way! I, the transparent medium, Thy glory to display.


[Verse 2] 
The temple has been yielded and purified of sin; let Thy Shekinah glory now flash forth from within. And all the earth keep silence, the body henceforth be Thy silent, docile servant, moved only as by Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Its members every moment held subject to Thy call, ready to have Thee use them, or not be used at all. Held without restless longing, or strain or stress or fret, or chafings at Thy dealings, or thoughts of vain regret.


[Verse 4] 
Kept restful, calm, and pliant, from bond and bias free, permitting Thee to settle when Thou hast need of me. Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings! Be Thou the glorious answer to all my questionings.
