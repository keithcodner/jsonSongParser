[Verse 1] 
There's a secret I must tell Of all the love I've found. And it's hidden in my heart The day you tore my world apart.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah, King forever, Friend and Saviour Jesus' blood never fails me Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood.


[Verse 3] 
And this secret, it will run To the corners of the earth Where ev'ry woman, ev'ry son Will carry high their chains undone.   Jesus' blood never fails me, Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood.(3x)   Sing your songs of freedom Praise the God of Heaven Lord that never fails me Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood.
