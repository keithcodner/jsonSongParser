[Verse 1] 
He that doth in the secret place of the Most High reside, under the shade of Him that is the Almighty shall abide.


[Verse 2] 
I of the Lord my God will say, He is my refuge still, He is my fortress and my God, and in Him trust I will.


[Verse 3] 
Assuredly He shall thee save, and give deliverance both from the fowler’s snare, and from the noisome pestilence.


[Verse 4] 
His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust under His wings shall be: His faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler unto thee.


[Verse 5] 
Thou shalt not need to be afraid for terrors of the night; nor for the arrow that doth fly by day, while it is light;


[Verse 6] 
Nor for the pestilence, that walks in darkness secretly; nor for destruction that doth waste at noon-day openly.


[Verse 7] 
Because on me He set His love, deliver him will I; because my great name he hath known, I will him set on high.


[Verse 8] 
He’ll call on me, I’ll answer him; I will be with him still in trouble, to deliver him, and honour him I will.
