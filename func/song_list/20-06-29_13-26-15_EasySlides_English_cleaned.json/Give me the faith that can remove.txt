[Verse 1] 
Give me the faith that can remove and sink the mountain to a plain: give me the child-like praying love which longs to build Thy house again: Thy love let it my heart o'erpower, and all my yearning soul devour!


[Verse 2] 
I would the precious time redeem, and longer live for this alone, to spend and to be spent for them who have not yet my Saviour known; and turn them to a pardoning God, and quench the brands in Jesus' blood.


[Verse 3] 
My talents, gifts, and graces, Lord, into Thy blessed hands receive; and let me live to preach Thy word; and let me to Thy glory live; my every sacred moment spend in publishing the sinners' Friend.


[Verse 4] 
Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart with boundless charity divine! So shall I all my strength exert, and love them with a zeal like Thine; and lead them to Thy open side, the sheep for whom their Shepherd died.
