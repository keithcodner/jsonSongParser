[Verse 1] 
Little by little everyday Little by little in every way Jesus is changing me, He's changing me. Since I made that turn about face I've been growing in His grace Jesus is changing me.


[Verse 2] 
He's changing me, my precious Saviour I'm not the same person that I used to be Well, it's been slow going But still there's knowing That someday perfect I will be.
