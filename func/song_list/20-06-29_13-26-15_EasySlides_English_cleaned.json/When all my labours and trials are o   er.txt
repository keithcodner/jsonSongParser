[Verse 1] 
When all my labours and trials are o’er, and I am safe on that beautiful shore, just to be near the dear Lord I adore, will through the ages be glory for me.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, that will be glory for me, glory for me, glory for me, when by His grace I shall look on His face, that will be glory, be glory for me.


[Verse 3] 
When, by the gift of His infinite grace, I am accorded in heaven a place, just to be there, and to look on His face, will through the ages be glory for me.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, that will be glory for me, glory for me, glory for me, when by His grace I shall look on His face, that will be glory, be glory for me.


[Verse 5] 
Friends will be there I have loved long ago; joy like a river around me will flow, yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know, will through the ages be glory for me.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, that will be glory for me, glory for me, glory for me, when by His grace I shall look on His face, that will be glory, be glory for me.
