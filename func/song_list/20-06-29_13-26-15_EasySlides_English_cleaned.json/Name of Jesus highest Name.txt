[Verse 1] 
Name of Jesus! highest Name! Name that earth and heaven adore! From the heart of God it came, leads me to Godâ€™s heart once more.


[Verse 2] 
Name of Jesus! living tide! Days of drought for me are past; how much more than satisfied are the thirsty lips at last!


[Verse 3] 
Name of Jesus! dearest Name! Bread of heaven, and balm of love: oil of gladness, surest claim to the treasures stored above.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus gives forgiveness free, Jesus cleanses all my stains; Jesus gives His life to me, Jesus always He remains.


[Verse 5] 
Only Jesus! fairest Name! Life, and rest, and peace, and bliss; Jesus, evermore the same, He is mine, and I am His.
