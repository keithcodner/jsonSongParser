[Verse 1] 
What kind of greatness can this be, that chose to be made small? Exchanging untold majesty for a world so pitiful. That God should come as one of us, I'll never understand. The more I hear the story told, the more amazed I am.


[Verse 2] 
O what else can I do but kneel and worship you, and come just as I am, my whole life an offering.


[Verse 3] 
The One in whom we live and move in swaddling clothes lies bound. The voice that cried, 'Let there be light', asleep without a sound. The One who strode among the stars, and called each one by name, lies helpless in a mother's arms and must learn to walk again.


[Verse 4] 
O what else can I do but kneel and worship you, and come just as I am, my whole life an offering.


[Verse 5] 
What greater love could he have shown to shamed humanity, yet human pride hates to believe in such deep humility. But nations now may see his grace and know that he is near, when his meek heart, his words, his works are incarnate in us.


[Verse 6] 
O what else can I do but kneel and worship you, and come just as I am, my whole life an offering.
