[Verse 1] 
In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet, God leads His dear children along; where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet, God leads His dear children along.


[Verse 2] 
Some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fire, but all through the blood; some through great sorrow, but God gives a song, in the night season and all the day long.


[Verse 3] 
Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright, God leads His dear children along; sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night, God leads His dear children along.


[Verse 4] 
Some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fire, but all through the blood; some through great sorrow, but God gives a song, in the night season and all the day long.


[Verse 5] 
Though sorrows befall us and evils oppose, God leads His dear children along; through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes, God leads His dear children along.


[Verse 6] 
Some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fire, but all through the blood; some through great sorrow, but God gives a song, in the night season and all the day long.
