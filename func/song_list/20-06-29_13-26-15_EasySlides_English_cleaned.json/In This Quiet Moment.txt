[Verse 1] 
In this quiet moment, It's Your breath I feel; Breathing deeply into my soul, So my life can heal.


[Verse 2] 
Spirit of God, I feel Your touch, Spirit of God I do. Spirit of God, move in my heart, As I yield my life to You. Spirit of God, illumine me, Shine through this darkness, so I can see, How the Spirit of God has set me, Free to proclaim Your glory.


[Verse 3] 
In this quiet moment, As my heart is still; I choose to live accordingly, To Your perfect will.


[Verse 4] 
Spirit of God, I feel Your touch, Spirit of God I do. Spirit of God, move in my heart, As I yield my life to You. Spirit of God, illumine me, Shine through this darkness, so I can see, How the Spirit of God has set me, Free to proclaim Your glory.
