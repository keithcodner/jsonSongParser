[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Prince and Saviour, Lord of life who died; Christ, the friend of sinners, sinners crucified. For a lost world’s ransom, all Himself He gave, lay at last death’s victim, lifeless in the grave.


[Verse 2] 
Lord of life triumphant, risen now to reign! King of endless ages, Jesus lives again!


[Verse 3] 
In His power and Godhead every victory won; pain and passion ended, all His purpose done. Christ the Lord is risen! sighs and sorrows past, death’s dark night is over, morning comes at last!


[Verse 4] 
Lord of life triumphant, risen now to reign! King of endless ages, Jesus lives again!


[Verse 5] 
Resurrection morning! Sinners’ bondage freed; Christ the Lord is risen, He is risen indeed! Jesus, Prince and Saviour, Lord of life who died, Christ the King of glory now is glorified!


[Verse 6] 
Lord of life triumphant, risen now to reign! King of endless ages, Jesus lives again!
