[Verse 1] 
Let us sing of His love once again, of the love that can never decay, of the blood of the Lamb who was slain, till we praise Him again in that day.


[Verse 2] 
I believe Jesus saves!. and His blood makes me whiter than snow! I believe Jesus saves!. and His blood makes me whiter than snow!


[Verse 3] 
There are cleansing and healing for all who will wash in the life-giving flood; there is perfect deliverance and joy to be had in this world through the blood. I believe Jesus saves….


[Verse 4] 
Even now, while we taste of His love, we are filled with delight through His name; but what will it be when, above, we shall join in the song of the Lamb? I believe Jesus saves….


[Verse 5] 
Then we’ll march in His name till we come, at His bidding to cease from the fight, and our Saviour shall welcome us home To the regions of glory and light. I believe Jesus saves….


[Verse 6] 
So with banner unfurled to the breeze, our motto shall “Holiness” be, till the crown from His hand we receive, and the King in His glory we see!


[Verse 7] 
I am sure we shall win, for we fight in the strength of our King. I am sure we shall win, for we fight in the strength of our King.
