[Verse 1] 
Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world; they resound with God's own heart, O, let the ancient words impart; words of life, words of hope, give us strength, help us cope; in this world where'er we roam, ancient words will guide us home.


[Verse 2] 
Ancient words, ever true, changing me, changing you; we have come with open hearts, O, let the ancient words impart.


[Verse 3] 
Holy words of our faith handed down to this age, came to us through sacrifice; O, heed the faithful words of Christ; holy words long preserved for our walk in this world; they resound with God's own heart; O, let the ancient words impart.


[Verse 4] 
Ancient words, ever true, changing me, changing you; we have come with open hearts, O, let the ancient words impart.
