[Verse 1] 
O the blood of Jesus, O the blood of Jesus, O the blood of Jesus, he washes white as snow.


[Verse 2] 
O the cross of Jesus, O the cross of Jesus, O the cross of Jesus, his death brings life to me.


[Verse 3] 
O the love of Jesus, O the love of Jesus, O the love of Jesus, he freely gives to me,


[Verse 4] 
O the blood of Jesus, O the blood of Jesus, O the blood of Jesus, it washes white as snow.
