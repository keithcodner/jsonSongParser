[Verse 1] 
O sinner, the Saviour is calling for thee, long, long has He called thee in vain! He called thee when joy lent its crown to thy days, He called thee in sorrow and pain.


[Verse 2] 
O turn, while the Saviour in mercy is waiting, and steer for the harbour light! For how do you know but your soul may be drifting over the dead-line tonight?


[Verse 3] 
O sinner, thine ears have been deaf to His voice, thine eyes to His glory been dim! The calls of thy Saviour have so wearied thee, oh what if they should weary Him?


[Verse 4] 
O turn, while the Saviour in mercy is waiting, and steer for the harbour light! For how do you know but your soul may be drifting over the dead-line tonight?


[Verse 5] 
O sinner, the Spirit is striving with thee! What if He should strive never more, but leave thee alone in thy darkness to dwell, in sight of the heavenly shore?


[Verse 6] 
O turn, while the Saviour in mercy is waiting, and steer for the harbour light! For how do you know but your soul may be drifting over the dead-line tonight?


[Verse 7] 
O sinner, God’s patience may weary some day, and leave thy sad soul in the blast! By wilful resistance you’ve drifted away over the dead-line at last.


[Verse 8] 
O turn, while the Saviour in mercy is waiting, and steer for the harbour light! For how do you know but your soul may be drifting over the dead-line tonight?
