[Verse 1] 
King of my life I crown Thee now, Thine shall the glory be; lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow, lead me to Calvary.


[Verse 2] 
Lest I forget Gethsemane, lest I forget Thine agony, lest I forget Thy love for me, lead me to Calvary.


[Verse 3] 
Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid, tenderly mourned and wept: angels in robes of light arrayed, guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.


[Verse 4] 
Lest I forget Gethsemane, lest I forget Thine agony, lest I forget Thy love for me, lead me to Calvary.


[Verse 5] 
Let me, like Mary, through the gloom, come with a gift to Thee; show to me now the empty tomb, lead me to Calvary.


[Verse 6] 
Lest I forget Gethsemane, lest I forget Thine agony, lest I forget Thy love for me, lead me to Calvary.


[Verse 7] 
May I be willing, Lord, to bear daily my cross for Thee; even Thy cup of grief to share, Thou hast borne all for me.


[Verse 8] 
Lest I forget Gethsemane, lest I forget Thine agony, lest I forget Thy love for me, lead me to Calvary.


[Verse 9] 
Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire for all who know not Thee; then touch my lips with holy fire, to speak of Calvary.


[Verse 10] 
Lest I forget Gethsemane, lest I forget Thine agony, lest I forget Thy love for me, lead me to Calvary.
