[Verse 1] 
Father, although I cannot see the future You have planned, and though the path is sometimes dark and hard to understand: yet give me faith, through joy and pain, to trace Your loving hand.


[Verse 2] 
When I recall that in the past Your promises have stood through each perplexing circumstance and every changing mood, I rest content that all things work together for my good.


[Verse 3] 
Whatever, then, the future brings of good or seeming ill, I ask for strength to follow You and grace to trust You still; and I would look for no reward, except to do Your will.
