[Verse 1] 
Abiding, oh, so wondrous sweet; I’m resting at the Saviour’s feet! I trust in Him, I’m satisfied, I’m resting in the Crucified!


[Verse 2] 
Abiding, abiding, oh! so wondrous sweet! I’m resting, resting at the Saviour’s feet.


[Verse 3] 
He speaks, and by His word is given His peace, a rich foretaste of heaven! Not as the world He peace doth give; ‘tis through this hope my soul shall live.


[Verse 4] 
Abiding, abiding, oh! so wondrous sweet! I’m resting, resting at the Saviour’s feet.


[Verse 5] 
I live; not I; ‘tis He alone by whom the mighty work is done; dead to myself, alive to Him, I count all loss His rest to gain.


[Verse 6] 
Abiding, abiding, oh! so wondrous sweet! I’m resting, resting at the Saviour’s feet.


[Verse 7] 
Now rest, my heart, the work is done, I’m saved through the Eternal Son! Let all my powers my soul employ, To tell the world my peace and joy.


[Verse 8] 
Abiding, abiding, oh! so wondrous sweet! I’m resting, resting at the Saviour’s feet.
