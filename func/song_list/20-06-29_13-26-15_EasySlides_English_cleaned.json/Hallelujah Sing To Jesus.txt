[Verse 1] 
Hallelujah! Sing to Jesus; His the sceptre, His the throne; Hallelujah! His the triumph, His the victory alone. Hark, the songs of holy Zion Thunder like a mighty flood: 'Jesus out of every nation Hath redeemed us by His blood.'


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah! not as orphans Are we left in sorrow now; Hallelujah! He is near us, Faith believes, nor questions how. Though the clouds from sight received Him When the forty days were o'er, Shall our hearts forget His promise, 'I am with you ever more'?


[Verse 3] 
Hallelujah! Bread of heaven, Thou on earth our food, our stay; Hallelujah! here the sinful Flee to Thee from day to day. Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth's Redeemer, plead for me Where the songs of all the sinless Sweep across the crystal sea.


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah! sing to Jesus; His the sceptre, His the throne; Hallelujah! His the triumph, His the victory alone. Hark, the songs of holy Zion Thunder like a mighty flood: 'Jesus out of every nation Hath redeemed us by His blood.'
