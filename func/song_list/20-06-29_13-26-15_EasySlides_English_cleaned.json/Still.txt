[Verse 1] 
Hide me now Under Your wings Cover me within Your mighty hand


[Verse 2] 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar I will soar with You above the storm Father you are King over the flood I will be still and know You are God


[Verse 3] 
Find rest my soul In Christ alone Know His power In quietness and trust
