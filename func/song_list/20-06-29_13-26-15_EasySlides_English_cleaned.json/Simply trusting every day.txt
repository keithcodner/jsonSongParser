[Verse 1] 
Simply trusting every day, trusting through a stormy way; even when my faith is small, trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 2] 
Trusting as the moments fly; trusting as the days go by; trusting Him whate’er befall; trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 3] 
Brightly doth His Spirit shine into this poor heart of mine. While He leads I cannot fall; trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 4] 
Trusting as the moments fly; trusting as the days go by; trusting Him whate’er befall; trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 5] 
Singing if my way is clear; praying if the path be drear; if in danger, for Him call; trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 6] 
Trusting as the moments fly; trusting as the days go by; trusting Him whate’er befall; trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 7] 
Trusting Him while life shall last, trusting Him till earth be past, till within the jasper wall: trusting Jesus, that is all.


[Verse 8] 
Trusting as the moments fly; trusting as the days go by; trusting Him whate’er befall; trusting Jesus, that is all.
