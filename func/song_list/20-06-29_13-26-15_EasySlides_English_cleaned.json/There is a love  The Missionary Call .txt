[Verse 1] 
There is a love from the Father up above, Revealed in everything we see, There is a still voice urging me, go into the world, His Spirit in my heart leading me. Go ye therefore into all the world, No matter how, be steadfast and bold, Obey His call to preach His name, For Jesus now has won the victory.


[Verse 2] 
Go ye in His authority, to bring a change in destiny; Though there's trouble where I tread, There will be no turning back; Go with the vision of the lost, No matter what the call may cost, That the Gospel may be preached in all the world.
