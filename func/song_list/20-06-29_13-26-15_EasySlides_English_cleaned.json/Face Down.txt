[Verse 1] 
Welcomed in to the courts of the King I've been ushered into Your presence. Lord I stand on Your merciful ground Yet with every step tread wityh reverence


[Verse 2] 
And I'll fall face down As Your glory shines around x2


[Verse 3] 
There is none in the heavens like You And upon earth who's Your equal. You are far above, you're the highest of heights I am bowing down to exalt You


[Verse 4] 
So let Your glory shine around Let Your glory shine around King of glory there be found King of glory x3
