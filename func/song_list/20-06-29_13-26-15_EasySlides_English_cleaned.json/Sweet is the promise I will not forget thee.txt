[Verse 1] 
Sweet is the promise, “I will not forget thee,” nothing can molest or turn my soul away; e’en though the night be dark within the valley, just beyond is shining an eternal day.


[Verse 2] 
I will not forget thee or leave thee, in My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee; I will not forget thee or leave thee I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.


[Verse 3] 
How can I show my gratitude to Jesus, for His love unfailing and His tender care? I will proclaim to others His salvation, that they may accept Him and His promise share.


[Verse 4] 
I will not forget thee or leave thee, in My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee; I will not forget thee or leave thee I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.


[Verse 5] 
Trusting the promise, “I will not forget thee,” onward will I go with songs of joy and praise; though earth despise me, though my friends forsake me, Jesus will be near me, gladdening my days.


[Verse 6] 
I will not forget thee or leave thee, in My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee; I will not forget thee or leave thee I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.


[Verse 7] 
When at the golden portals I am standing, all my tribulations, all my sorrows past, how sweet to hear the blessed proclamation: Enter faithful servant, welcome home at last.


[Verse 8] 
I will not forget thee or leave thee, in My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee; I will not forget thee or leave thee I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
