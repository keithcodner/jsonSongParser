[Verse 1] 
Hail Jesus, You're my King, Your life frees me to sing, I will praise You all my days, You're perfect in all Your ways.


[Verse 2] 
Hail Jesus, You're my Lord, I will obey Your word, I want to see Your kingdom come, Not my will but Yours be done.


[Verse 3] 
Glory, glory to the Lamb, You take me into the land, We will conquer in Your name, And proclaim that Jesus reigns.


[Verse 4] 
Hail, hail lion of Judah, How powerful You are, Hail, hail lion of Judah, How wonderful You are, how wonderful You are
