[Verse 1] 
Won't You Lord take a look at our hands Everything we have, use it for Your plan Won't You Lord take a look at our hearts Mould it, refine it As You set us apart


[Verse 2] 
We want to run to the altar And catch the fire, to stand in the gap Between the living and the dead Give us a heart of compassion For a world without vision We will make a difference Bringing hope to the land
