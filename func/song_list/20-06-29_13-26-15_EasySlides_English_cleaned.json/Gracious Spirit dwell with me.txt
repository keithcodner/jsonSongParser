[Verse 1] 
Gracious Spirit, dwell with me, I myself would gracious be: and, with words that help and heal, would Thy life in mine reveal; and with actions bold and meek, would for Christ my Saviour speak.


[Verse 2] 
Holy Spirit, dwell with me, I myself would holy be; separate from sin, I would choose and cherish all things good: and whatever I can be give to Him who gave me Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Mighty Spirit, dwell with me, I myself would mighty be; mighty so as to prevail, where unaided man must fail: ever, by a mighty hope, pressing on and bearing up.


[Verse 4] 
Tender Spirit, dwell with me, I myself would tender be. Shut my heart up like a flower, at temptationâ€™s darksome hour; open it, when shines the sun, and His love by fragrance own.
