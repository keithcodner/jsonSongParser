[Verse 1] 
Give me a vision, Lord, I plead, vision of souls and a world in need: loved ones and friends, the one next door, then let me see there are millions more.


[Verse 2] 
Give me a vision, heart-stirring vision, open my eyes, Lord, today; show me the sighing, doomed and the dying, give me a vision, I pray.


[Verse 3] 
Give me a vision, Lord divine, kindle with fire this cold heart of mine; may with unselfishness it burn, fill me with love and a deep concern.


[Verse 4] 
Give me a vision, heart-stirring vision, open my eyes, Lord, today; show me the sighing, doomed and the dying, give me a vision, I pray.


[Verse 5] 
Give me a vision, Lord divine, so charged with power that it shall shine out to the lost in deepest night, wandering alone in their sad, sad plight.


[Verse 6] 
Give me a vision, heart-stirring vision, open my eyes, Lord, today; show me the sighing, doomed and the dying, give me a vision, I pray.


[Verse 7] 
Give me a vision, Lord divine, without a limit or boundary line; help me to see a world in sin, not just the field I am working in.


[Verse 8] 
Give me a vision, heart-stirring vision, open my eyes, Lord, today; show me the sighing, doomed and the dying, give me a vision, I pray.
