[Verse 1] 
Now in a song of grateful praise, to Thee, O Lord, my voice I’ll raise, with all Thy saints I’ll join to tell, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 2] 
And above the rest this note shall swell, this note shall swell, this note shall swell. And above the rest this note shall swell, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 3] 
How sovereign, wonderful and free, has been Thy love to sinful me; Thou savedst me from the jaws of hell, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 4] 
And above the rest this note shall swell, this note shall swell, this note shall swell. And above the rest this note shall swell, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 5] 
Since e’er my soul has known His love, what mercies He has made me prove, mercies which do all praise excel, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 6] 
And above the rest this note shall swell, this note shall swell, this note shall swell. And above the rest this note shall swell, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 7] 
And when to that bright world I rise, and join the anthems of the skies, above the rest this note shall swell, my Jesus has done all things well.


[Verse 8] 
And above the rest this note shall swell, this note shall swell, this note shall swell. And above the rest this note shall swell, my Jesus has done all things well.
