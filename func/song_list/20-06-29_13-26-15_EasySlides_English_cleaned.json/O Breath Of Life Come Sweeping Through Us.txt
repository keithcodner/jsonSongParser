[Verse 1] 
O breath of life, come sweeping through us, Revive Thy church with life and power. O Breath of Life, come, cleanse, renew us, And fit Thy church to meet this hour.


[Verse 2] 
O Wind of God, come, bend us, break us, Till humbly we confess our need; Then in Thy tenderness remake us, Revive, restore; for this we plead.


[Verse 3] 
O Breath of Love, come, breathe within us, Renewing thought and will and heart: Come, love of Christ, afresh to win us, Revive Thy church in every part.


[Verse 4] 
Revive us, Lord! is zeal abating While harvest fields are vast and white? Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting, Equip Thy church to spread the light.
