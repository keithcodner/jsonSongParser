Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him! How I've proven him o'er and o'er! Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust him more!

O how sweet to trust in Jesus, Just to trust his cleansing blood; just in simple faith to plunge me 'neath the healing, cleasning flood.

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him! How I've proven him o'er and o'er! Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust him more!

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him! How I've proven him o'er and o'er! Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust him more!

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus, just from sin and self to cease; just from Jesus simple taking life and rest, and joy and peace.


[Verse 8] 
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him! How I've proven him o'er and o'er! Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust him more!

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him! How I've proven him o'er and o'er! Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust him more!
