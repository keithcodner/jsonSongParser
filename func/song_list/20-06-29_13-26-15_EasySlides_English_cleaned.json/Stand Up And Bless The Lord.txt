[Verse 1] 
Stand up, and bless the Lord, Ye people of His choice; Stand up, and bless the Lord your God With heart, and soul, and voice.


[Verse 2] 
Though high above all praise, Above all blessing high, Who would not fear His holy name, And laud and magnify?


[Verse 3] 
O for the living flame From His own altar brought, To touch our lips, our minds inspire, And wing to heaven our thought!


[Verse 4] 
God is our strength and song, And His salvation ours; Then be His love in Christ proclaimed With all our ransomed powers.


[Verse 5] 
Stand up, and bless the Lord, The Lord your God adore; Stand up, and bless His glorious name Henceforth forever more.
