[Verse 1] 
What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought Since Jesus came into my heart! I have light in my soul for which long I have sought, Since Jesus came into my heart!


[Verse 2] 
Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart!


[Verse 3] 
I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray, Since Jesus came into my heart! And my sins, which were many, are all washed away, Since Jesus came into my heart!


[Verse 4] 
Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart!


[Verse 5] 
I shall go there to dwell in that City, I know, Since Jesus came into my heart! And I'm happy, so happy, as onward I go, Since Jesus came into my heart!


[Verse 6] 
Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart!
