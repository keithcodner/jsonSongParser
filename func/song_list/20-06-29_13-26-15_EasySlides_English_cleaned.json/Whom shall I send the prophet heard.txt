[Verse 1] 
“Whom shall I send?” the prophet heard when he, enraptured, saw the Lord; He rose and went, his spirit stirred, “Whom shall I send today?”


[Verse 2] 
“Whom shall I send?” O hear the cry! “Whom shall I send?” From sky to sky! “Whom shall I send to bring men nigh? Whom shall I send today?”


[Verse 3] 
Do the bright youth no longer care? Do they not see the treasures rare? Where are they then, O where, O where? “Whom shall I send today?”


[Verse 4] 
Following far they hear no call! Sleeping so sound while millions fall! Do they not care at all, at all? “Whom shall I send today?”


[Verse 5] 
“Whom shall I send?” O who will go? Who then will preach with a voice of woe? Who will be sped by love's strong bow? “May I send you today?”


[Verse 6] 
Lord of the harvest, here am I, I can no more resist Thy cry, cost what it may: to live or die. Send me, dear Lord, today.
