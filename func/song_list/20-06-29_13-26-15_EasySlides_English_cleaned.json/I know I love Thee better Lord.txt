[Verse 1] 
I know I love Thee better, Lord, than any earthly joy, for Thou hast given me the peace which nothing can destroy.


[Verse 2] 
The half has never yet been told of love so full and free. the half has never yet been told: the blood, it cleanseth me.


[Verse 3] 
I know that Thou art nearer still than any earthly throng, and sweeter is the thought of Thee than any lovely song.


[Verse 4] 
The half has never yet been told of love so full and free. the half has never yet been told: the blood, it cleanseth me.


[Verse 5] 
Thou hast put gladness in my heart; then well may I be glad! Without the secret of Thy love I could not but be sad.


[Verse 6] 
The half has never yet been told of love so full and free. the half has never yet been told: the blood, it cleanseth me.


[Verse 7] 
O Saviour, precious Saviour, mine! What will Thy presence be, if such a life of joy can crown our walk on earth with Thee?


[Verse 8] 
The half has never yet been told of love so full and free. the half has never yet been told: the blood, it cleanseth me.
