[Verse 1] 
Like the woman at the well I was seeking for things that could not satisfy; and then I heard my Saviour speaking: “Draw from My well that never shall run dry.”


[Verse 2] 
Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord! Come and quench this thirsting of my soul; Bread of heaven, feed me ‘til I want no more; fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!


[Verse 3] 
There are millions in this world who are craving the pleasure earthly things afford; but none can match the wondrous treasure that I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord! Come and quench this thirsting of my soul; Bread of heaven, feed me ‘til I want no more; fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!


[Verse 5] 
So, my brother, if the things this world gave you leave hungers that won’t pass away, my blessed Lord will come and save you, if you kneel to Him and humbly pray:


[Verse 6] 
Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord! Come and quench this thirsting of my soul; Bread of heaven, feed me ‘til I want no more; fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
