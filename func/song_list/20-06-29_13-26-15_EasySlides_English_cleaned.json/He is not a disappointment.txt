[Verse 1] 
He is not a disappointment! Jesus is far more to me than in all my glowing daydreams I had fancied He could be; and the more I get to know Him, so the more I find Him true, and the more I long that others should be led to know Him too.


[Verse 2] 
He is not a disappointment! He has saved my soul from sin; all the guilt and all the anguish which oppressed my heart within He has banished by His presence, and His blessed kiss of peace has assured my heart for ever that His love will never cease.


[Verse 3] 
He is not a disappointment! He has sanctified my soul, cleansed me from my heart corruption, purified and made me whole; He removed the sinward proneness, stamped His image in its place, for He won me by the beauty and unveiling of His face.


[Verse 4] 
He is not a disappointment! He is all in all to me, Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer; the unchanging Christ is He! He has won my heartâ€™s affections, and He meets my every need; He is not a disappointment, for He satisfies indeed. (Repeat last 2 lines of each verse)
