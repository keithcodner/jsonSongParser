Sing them over again to me, wonderful words of life! Let me more of their beauty see, wonderful words of life! Words of life and beauty, teach me faith and duty.

Beautiful words! wonderful words! Wonderful words of life! Beautiful words! wonderful words! Wonderful words of life

Beautiful words! wonderful words! Wonderful words of life! Beautiful words! wonderful words! Wonderful words of life

Sweetly echo the gospel call, wonderful words of life! Offer pardon and peace to all, wonderful words of life! Jesus, only Saviour, sanctify for ever!
