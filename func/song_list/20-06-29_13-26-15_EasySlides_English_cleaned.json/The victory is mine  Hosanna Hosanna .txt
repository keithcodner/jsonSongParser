[Verse 1] 
The victory is mine, when the battle is the Lord's. Hosanna! Hosanna! No enemy can stand, when His praise goes forth. Hosanna! Hosanna!


[Verse 2] 
When fear and doubt surround me all about And the enemy's camp is near, Say that Jesus in me is greater Than he who is in the world.


[Verse 3] 
Hosanna! He has won the victory. Hosanna! Over all our enemies. Hosanna! We lift our hands in praise. Hosanna! We will conquer in His name.
