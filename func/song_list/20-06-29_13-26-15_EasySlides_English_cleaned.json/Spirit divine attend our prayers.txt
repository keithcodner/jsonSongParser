[Verse 1] 
Spirit divine, attend our prayers, and make this house Thy home; descend with all Thy gracious powers, O come, great Spirit, come!


[Verse 2] 
Come as the light; to us reveal our emptiness and woe; and lead us in those paths of life where all the righteous go.


[Verse 3] 
Come as the fire; and purge our hearts like sacrificial flame; let our whole soul an offering be to our Redeemerâ€™s name.


[Verse 4] 
Come as the Dove; and spread Thy wings, the wings of perfect love; and let Thy Church on earth become blest as the Church above.


[Verse 5] 
Spirit divine, attend our prayers, make a lost world Thy home; descend with all Thy gracious powers, O come, great Spirit, come!
