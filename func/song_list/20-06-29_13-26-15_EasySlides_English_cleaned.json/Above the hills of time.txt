[Verse 1] 
Above the hills of time the Cross is gleaming; Fair as the sun when night has turned to day; And from it love's pure light is richly streaming To cleanse the heart and banish sin away.   To this dear Cross the eyes of men are turning Today as in the ages lost to sight; And so for Thee O Christ, men's hearts are yearning As ship-wrecked seamen yearn for morning light.


[Verse 2] 
The Cross, O Christ, Thy wondrous love revealing, Awakes our hearts as with the light of morn; And pardon o'er our sinful spirits stealing Tells us that we, in Thee, have been reborn.   Like echoes to sweet temple bells replying, Our hearts, O Lord make answer to Thy love; And we will love Thee with a love undying, Till we are gathered to Thy home above.
