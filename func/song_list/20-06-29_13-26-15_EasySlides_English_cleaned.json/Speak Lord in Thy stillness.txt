[Verse 1] 
Speak, Lord, in Thy stillness, while I wait on Thee; hush my heart to listen in expectancy.


[Verse 2] 
Speak, O blessed Master, in this quiet hour; let me see Thy face, Lord, feel Thy touch of power.


[Verse 3] 
For the words Thou speakest, they are life indeed; living bread from heaven, now my spirit feed!


[Verse 4] 
Satiate my being, with Thy fullness fill; as the dew descending, let Thy speech distil.


[Verse 5] 
All to Thee is yielded, I am not mine own; blissful, glad surrender, I am Thine alone.


[Verse 6] 
Speak, Thy servant heareth; be not silent, Lord! Waits my soul upon Thee for the quickening word.


[Verse 7] 
Fill me with the knowledge of Thy glorious will; all Thine own good pleasure in Thy child fulfil.


[Verse 8] 
Like a watered garden full of fragrance rare, lingering in Thy presence let my life appear.
