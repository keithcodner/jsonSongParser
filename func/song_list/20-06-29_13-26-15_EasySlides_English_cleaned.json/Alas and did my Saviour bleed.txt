[Verse 1] 
Alas! and did my Saviour bleed, and did my Sovereign die? Would He devote that sacred head for such a worm as I?


[Verse 2] 
Was it for crimes that I had done, He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity, grace unknown, and love beyond degree!


[Verse 3] 
Well might the sun in darkness hide, and shut his glories in, when Christ, the great Creator, died for man the creature’s sin.


[Verse 4] 
Thus might I hide my blushing face while His dear cross appears, dissolve my heart in thankfulness, and melt mine eyes to tears.


[Verse 5] 
But drops of grief can ne’er repay the debt of love I owe; here, Lord, I give myself away, ‘tis all that I can do!
