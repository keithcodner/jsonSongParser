[Verse 1] 
When Israel out of bondage came, a sea before them lay; the Lord reached down His mighty hand and rolled the sea away.


[Verse 2] 
Then forward still, ‘tis Jehovah’s will, though the billows dash and spray; with a conquering tread we will push ahead, He’ll roll the sea away.


[Verse 3] 
Before me was a sea of sin, so great I feared to pray; my heart’s desire the Saviour read and rolled the sea away.


[Verse 4] 
Then forward still, ‘tis Jehovah’s will, though the billows dash and spray; with a conquering tread we will push ahead, He’ll roll the sea away.


[Verse 5] 
When sorrows dark, like stormy waves were dashing o’er my way, again the Lord in mercy came and rolled the sea away.


[Verse 6] 
Then forward still, ‘tis Jehovah’s will, though the billows dash and spray; with a conquering tread we will push ahead, He’ll roll the sea away.


[Verse 7] 
And when I reach the sea of death, for needed grace I’ll pray; I know the Lord will quickly come and roll the sea away.


[Verse 8] 
Then forward still, ‘tis Jehovah’s will, though the billows dash and spray; with a conquering tread we will push ahead, He’ll roll the sea away.
