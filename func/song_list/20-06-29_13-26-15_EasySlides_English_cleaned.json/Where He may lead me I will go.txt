[Verse 1] 
Where He may lead me I will go, for I have learned to trust Him so, and I remember â€˜twas for me, that He was slain on Calvary.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus shall lead me night and day, Jesus shall lead me all the way; He is the truest Friend to me, for I remember Calvary.


[Verse 3] 
O I delight in His command, love to be led by His dear hand, His divine will is sweet to me, Hallowed by blood-stained Calvary.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus shall lead me night and day, Jesus shall lead me all the way; He is the truest Friend to me, for I remember Calvary.


[Verse 5] 
Onward I go, nor doubt nor fear, happy with Christ, my Saviour near, trusting some day that I shall see, Jesus, my Friend of Calvary.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus shall lead me night and day, Jesus shall lead me all the way; He is the truest Friend to me, for I remember Calvary.
