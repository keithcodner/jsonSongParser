[Verse 1] 
I think when, when I read that sweet story of old, when Jesus was here among men, how He called little children as lambs to His fold, I should like to have been with Him then. I wish that His hands had been placed on my head, That His arms had been thrown around me, and that I might have seen His kind look when He said, “Let little children come unto Me.”


[Verse 2] 
Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go, and ask for a share of His love; and, if I now earnestly seek Him below, I shall see Him and hear Him in that beautiful place He has gone to prepare for all who are washed and forgiven; and many dear children are gathering there, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.


[Verse 3] 
But thousands and thousands who wander and fall never heard of that heavenly home; I should like them to know there is room for them all, and that Jesus has bid them to come. I long for the joy of that glorious day, the fairest and brightest and best, when the dear little children of every cline, shall crowd to His arms and be blest.
