[Verse 1] 
My first love is Jesus, You're the one I adore, My first love is my Saviour, You're the one that I'm living for. My first joy is Jesus, You're the strength of my life, My first joy is my Master, You hold the keys to my life.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, You're my first love, How I love You, Oh how I love You, Lord.
