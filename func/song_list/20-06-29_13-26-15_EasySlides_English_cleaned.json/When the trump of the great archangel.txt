[Verse 1] 
When the trump of the great archangel Its mighty tones shall sound, And, the end of the world proclaiming, Shall pierce the depths profound; When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, With all the saints on high, What a shouting in the skies From the multitudes that rise, Changed in the twinkling of an eye


[Verse 2] 
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,.. Changed in the twinkling of an eye;... The trumpet shall sound, The dead shall be raised, Changed in the twinkling of an eye


[Verse 3] 
When He comes in the clouds descending, And they who loved Him here, From their graves shall awake and praise Him With joy and not with fear; When the body and the soul are united, And clothed no more to die, What a shouting there will be When each other's face we see; Changed in the twinkling of an eye


[Verse 4] 
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,.. Changed in the twinkling of an eye;... The trumpet shall sound, The dead shall be raised, Changed in the twinkling of an eye


[Verse 5] 
Oh the seed that was sown in weakness Shall then be raised in power, And the songs of the blood bought millions Shall hail that blissful hour; When we gather safely home in the morning, And night's dark shadows fly, What a shouting on the shore When we meet to part no more, Changed in the twinkling of an eye


[Verse 6] 
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,.. Changed in the twinkling of an eye;... The trumpet shall sound, The dead shall be raised, Changed in the twinkling of an eye
