[Verse 1] 
The blackness of my sin, overwhelming me, I grasp through the darkness, for something to guide me Falling, falling, down on my knees When Your light came along, and shone on me


[Verse 2] 
You stripped me off my blackness Jesus, You made me white Your blood so pure and holy Reached a wretched soul like me


[Verse 3] 
It doesn't matter now, if I don't know, Where exactly I'm going, it's all gonna lead me to Jesus, Jesus, who picked me up He's taking me home, to be his child


[Verse 4] 
You stripped me off my blackness Jesus, You made me white Your blood so pure and holy Reached a wretched soul like me
