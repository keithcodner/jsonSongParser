[Verse 1] 
Yes, God is good - in earth and sky, from ocean-depths and spreading wood, ten thousand voices seem to cry: 'God made us all, and God is good.'


[Verse 2] 
The sun that keeps his trackless way and downward pours his golden flood, night's sparkling hosts, all seem to say in accents clear that God is good.


[Verse 3] 
The merry birds prolong the strain, their song with ev'ry spring renewed; and balmy air and falling rain, each softly whispers: 'God is good.'


[Verse 4] 
We hear it in the rushing breeze; the hills that have for ages stood, the echoing sky and roaring seas, all swell the chorus: 'God is good.'


[Verse 5] 
For all thy gifts we bless thee, Lord, but chiefly for our heav'nly food, thy pard'ning grace, thy quick'ning word, these prompt our song, that God is good.
