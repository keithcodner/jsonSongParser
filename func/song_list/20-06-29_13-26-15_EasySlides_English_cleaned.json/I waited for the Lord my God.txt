[Verse 1] 
I waited for the Lord my God, and patiently did bear; at length to me He did incline my voice and cry to hear.


[Verse 2] 
He took me from a fearful pit, and from the miry clay, and on a rock He set my feet, establishing my way.


[Verse 3] 
He put a new song in my mouth, our God to magnify: many shall see it, and shall fear, and on the Lord rely.


[Verse 4] 
O blessed is the man whose trust upon the Lord relies; respecting not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.


[Verse 5] 
O Lord my God, full many are the wonders Thou hast done; Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward are above all thoughts are gone.


[Verse 6] 
None can they reckon, unto Thee: if I would them declare. If I would speak of them, they more than can be numbered, are.


[Verse 7] 
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost the God whom we adore be glory as it was, is now and shall be evermore.
