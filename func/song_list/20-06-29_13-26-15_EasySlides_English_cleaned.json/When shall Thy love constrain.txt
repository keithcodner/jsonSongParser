[Verse 1] 
When shall Thy love constrain and draw me to Thy breast? When shall my soul return again to her eternal rest?


[Verse 2] 
To rescue me from woe Thou didst with all things part, didst lead a suffering life below to win my worthless heart.


[Verse 3] 
Thy condescending grace to me did freely move; it calls me now to seek Thy face, and stoops to ask my love.


[Verse 4] 
And can I yet delay, my little all to give, to tear my soul from earth away for Jesus to receive?


[Verse 5] 
Nay, but I yield, I yield! I can hold out no more! I sink, by dying love compelled, and own Thee conqueror.


[Verse 6] 
My own desire be this - Thy love alone to know; to seek and taste no other bliss, no other good below!
