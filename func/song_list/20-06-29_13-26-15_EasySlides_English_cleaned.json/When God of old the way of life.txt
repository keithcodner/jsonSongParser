[Verse 1] 
When God of old the way of life would teach to all His own, He placed them safe beyond the reach of death, by blood alone.


[Verse 2] 
It is His word, God’s precious word, it stands for ever true: “When I the Lord shall see the blood, I will pass over you.”


[Verse 3] 
By Christ, the sinless Lamb of God, the precious blood was shed when He fulfilled God’s holy word, and suffered in our stead.


[Verse 4] 
It is His word, God’s precious word, it stands for ever true: “When I the Lord shall see the blood, I will pass over you.”


[Verse 5] 
O soul, for thee salvation thus by God is freely given; the blood of Christ atones for sin, and makes us meet for heaven.


[Verse 6] 
It is His word, God’s precious word, it stands for ever true: “When I the Lord shall see the blood, I will pass over you.”


[Verse 7] 
The wrath of God that was our due, upon the Lamb was laid; and by the shedding of His blood the debt for us was paid.


[Verse 8] 
It is His word, God’s precious word, it stands for ever true: “When I the Lord shall see the blood, I will pass over you.”


[Verse 9] 
How calm the judgement hour shall pass to all who do obey the word of God, and trust the blood, and make that word their stay!


[Verse 10] 
It is His word, God’s precious word, it stands for ever true: “When I the Lord shall see the blood, I will pass over you.”
