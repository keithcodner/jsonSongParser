[Verse 1] 
All things are possible to him that can in Jesus’ name believe; Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme, Thy truth I lovingly receive. I can, I do believe in Thee; all things are possible to me.


[Verse 2] 
‘Twas most impossible of all that here sin’s reign in me should cease, yet shall it be, I know it shall; Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness! If nothing is too hard for Thee, all things are possible to me.


[Verse 3] 
Though earth and hell the Word gainsay, the Word of God shall never fail; the Lord can break sin’s iron sway; ‘tis certain, though impossible. The thing impossible shall be. All things are possible to me.


[Verse 4] 
All things are possible to God; to Christ, the power of God in man; to me, when I am all renewed, in Christ am fully formed again, and from the reign of sin set free, all things are possible to me.


[Verse 5] 
All things are possible to God; to Christ, the power of God in me; now shed Thy mighty Self abroad, let me no longer live, but Thee; give me this hour in Thee to prove the sweet omnipotence of love.
