[Verse 1] 
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine; living with Jesus a new life divine; looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.


[Verse 2] 
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, moment by moment I’ve life fromabove; looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.


[Verse 3] 
Never a battle with wrong for the right, never a contest that He doth not fight; lifting above us His banner so whitemoment by moment I’m kept in His sight.


[Verse 4] 
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, moment by moment I’ve life fromabove; looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.


[Verse 5] 
Never a trial that He is not there, never a burden that He doth not bear, never a sorrow that He doth not share moment by moment I'm under His care.


[Verse 6] 
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, moment by moment I’ve life fromabove; looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.


[Verse 7] 
Never a heart-ache, and never a groan, never a tear-drop, and never a moan; never a danger but there on the throne, moment by moment He thinks of His own.


[Verse 8] 
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, moment by moment I’ve life fromabove; looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.


[Verse 9] 
Never a weakness that He doth not feel, never a sickness that He cannot heal; moment by moment, in woe or in weal, Jesus my Saviour abides with me still.


[Verse 10] 
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, moment by moment I’ve life fromabove; looking to Jesus till glory doth shine; moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
