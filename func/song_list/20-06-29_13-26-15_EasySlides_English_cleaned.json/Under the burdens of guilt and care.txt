[Verse 1] 
Under the burdens of guilt and care, many a spirit is grieving, who in the joy of the Lord might share, life everlasting receiving.


[Verse 2] 
Life! life! eternal life! Jesus alone is the Giver! Life! life! abundant life! Glory to Jesus for ever!


[Verse 3] 
Burdened one, why will you longer bear sorrows from which He releases? Open your heart, and, rejoicing, share life more abundant in Jesus!


[Verse 4] 
Life! life! eternal life! Jesus alone is the Giver! Life! life! abundant life! Glory to Jesus for ever!


[Verse 5] 
Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows, flooding the vale with a river; so, from the hill of the Cross, there flows life more abundant for ever.


[Verse 6] 
Life! life! eternal life! Jesus alone is the Giver! Life! life! abundant life! Glory to Jesus for ever!


[Verse 7] 
Oh, for the floods on the thirsty land! Oh, for a mighty revival! Oh, for a sanctified fearless band, ready to hail its arrival!


[Verse 8] 
Life! life! eternal life! Jesus alone is the Giver! Life! life! abundant life! Glory to Jesus for ever!
