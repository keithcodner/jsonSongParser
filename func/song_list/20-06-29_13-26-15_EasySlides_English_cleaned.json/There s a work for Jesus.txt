[Verse 1] 
There's a work for Jesus, ready at your hand, 'tis a task the Master just for you has planned. Haste to do His bidding, yield Him service true; there's a work for Jesus none but you can do.


[Verse 2] 
Work for Jesus, day by day, serve Him ever, falter never, Christ obey. Yield Him service, loyal, true; there's a work for Jesus none but you can do.


[Verse 3] 
There's a work for Jesus, humble though it be, 'tis the very service He would ask of thee. Go where fields are whitened, and the labourers few; there's a work for Jesus none but you can do.


[Verse 4] 
Work for Jesus, day by day, serve Him ever, falter never, Christ obey. Yield Him service, loyal, true; there's a work for Jesus none but you can do.


[Verse 5] 
There's a work for Jesus, precious souls to bring, tell them of His mercies, tell them of your King. Faint not, grow not weary, He will strength renew; there's a work for Jesus none but you can do.


[Verse 6] 
Work for Jesus, day by day, serve Him ever, falter never, Christ obey. Yield Him service, loyal, true; there's a work for Jesus none but you can do.
