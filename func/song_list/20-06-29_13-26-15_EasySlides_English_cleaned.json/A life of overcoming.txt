[Verse 1] 
A life of overcoming, a life of ceaseless praise, be this thy blessed portion, throughout the coming days. The victory was purchased on Calv’ry’s cross for thee, sin shall not have dominion, the Son hath made thee free.


[Verse 2] 
And would’st thou know the secret of constant victory? Let in the Overcomer, and He will conquer thee! Thy broken spirit, taken in sweet captivity, shall glory in His triumph and share His victory.


[Verse 3] 
Then from thy life ascending one triumph note of praise, (for they who always conquer a victor’s song must raise,) shall echo on unceasing till Satan’s host doth flee before our glorious watchword, “Lord, victory for me.”


[Verse 4] 
Though all the path before thee the host of darkness fill, look to thy Father’s promise, and claim the victory still. Faith sees the heavenly legions, where doubt sees nought but foes, and through the very conflict her life the stronger grows.


[Verse 5] 
More stern will grow the conflict as nears our King’s return, and they alone can face it who this great lesson learn: that from them God asks nothing but to unlatch the door admitting Him, who through them will conquer evermore.
