[Verse 1] 
Love Divine, so great and wondrous, deep and mighty, pure, sublime! Coming from the heart of Jesus, just the same through tests of time.


[Verse 2] 
He the pearly gates will open, so that I may enter in; for He purchased my redemption and forgave me all my sin.


[Verse 3] 
Like a dove when hunted, frightened as a wounded fawn was I; broken-hearted, yet He healed me, He will heed the sinner’s cry.


[Verse 4] 
He the pearly gates will open, so that I may enter in; for He purchased my redemption and forgave me all my sin.


[Verse 5] 
Love Divine, so great and wondrous, all my sins He then forgave! I will sing His praise forever, for His blood, His power to save.


[Verse 6] 
He the pearly gates will open, so that I may enter in; for He purchased my redemption and forgave me all my sin.


[Verse 7] 
In life’s eventide, at twilight, at His door I’ll knock and wait; by the precious love of Jesus I shall enter heaven’s gate.


[Verse 8] 
He the pearly gates will open, so that I may enter in; for He purchased my redemption and forgave me all my sin.
