[Verse 1] 
I will praise Your name, I will praise Your name, I will praise Your name, and extol You; I will praise Your name, I will praise Your name, I will praise Your name, as I behold You.   I will magnify, I will glorify, I will lift on high. Your name, Lord Jesus. I will magnify, I will glorify, I will lift on high, Your name, Lord Jesus.   For Your love is never ending and Your mercy ever true; I will bless Your name, Lord Jesus, for my heart belongs to You. I will praise Your name, I will praise Your name, I will praise Your name, as I behold You I will magnify, I will glorify, I will lift on high, Your name, Lord Jesus.
