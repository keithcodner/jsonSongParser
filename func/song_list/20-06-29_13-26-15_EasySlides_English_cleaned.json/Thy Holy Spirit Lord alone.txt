[Verse 1] 
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord alone can turn our hearts from sin; His power alone can sanctify and keep us pure within.


[Verse 2] 
O Spirit of Faith and Love, come in our midst, we pray, and purify each waiting heart; baptise us with power today.


[Verse 3] 
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone can deeper love inspire; His power alone within our souls can light the sacred fire.


[Verse 4] 
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can bring the gifts we seek in prayer; His voice can words of comfort speak and still each wave of care.


[Verse 5] 
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can give the grace we need this hour; and while we wait, O Spirit, come in sanctifying power.


[Verse 6] 
O Spirit of love, descend come in our midst, we pray and like a rushing, mighty wind sweep over our souls today.
