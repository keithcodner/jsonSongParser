[Verse 1] 
It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold: “Peace on the earth, goodwill to men from heaven’s all-gracious king!” The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.


[Verse 2] 
With sorrow brought by sin and strife the world has suffered long, and, since the angels sang, have passed two thousand years of wrong; for man at war with man hears not the love-song which they bring: O hush the noise, you men of strife, and hear the angels sing!


[Verse 3] 
And those whose journey now is hard, whose hope is burning low, who tread the rocky path of life with painful steps and slow: O listen to the news of love which makes the heavens ring! O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing!


[Verse 4] 
And still the days are hastening on - by prophets seen of old - towards the fulness of the time when comes the age foretold: then earth and heaven renewed shall see the Prince of Peace, their king; and all the world repeat the song which now the angels sing.
