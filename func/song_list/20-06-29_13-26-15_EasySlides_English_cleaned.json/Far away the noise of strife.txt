[Verse 1] 
Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling, then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand; doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling, none of these shall move me from Beulah Land.


[Verse 2] 
I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky, I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry, oh, yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply, for I am dwelling in Beulah Land.


[Verse 3] 
Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating, sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand; safe am I within the castle of God’s Word retreating, nothing then can reach me, ‘tis Beulah Land.


[Verse 4] 
I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky, I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry, oh, yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply, for I am dwelling in Beulah Land.


[Verse 5] 
Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me, I am safely sheltered here protected by God’s hand; here the sun is always shining, here there’s naught can harm me, I am safe for ever in Beulah Land.


[Verse 6] 
I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky, I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry, oh, yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply, for I am dwelling in Beulah Land.


[Verse 7] 
Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation, hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned; dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of full salvation, gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.


[Verse 8] 
I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky, I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry, oh, yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply, for I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
