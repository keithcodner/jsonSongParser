[Verse 1] 
Here I am once again, I pour out my heart for I know that You hear Every cry; You are listening, No matter what state my heart is in.


[Verse 2] 
You are faithful to answer With words that are true And a hope that is real. As I feel Your touch, You bring a freedom to all that's within.


[Verse 3] 
In the safety of this place I'm longing to...


[Verse 4] 
Pour out my heart, to say that I love You, Pour out my heart, to say that I need You. Pour out my heart, to say that I'm thankful, Pour out my heart, to say that You're wonderful.
