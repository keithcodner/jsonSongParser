[Verse 1] 
Saviour, my sin-stained soul longs to be fully whole and all Thy great salvation see. Haste I to Calvary's flow that washes white as snow, Thy blood, so freely shed for me.


[Verse 2] 
Long have I vainly tried to stem back nature's tide that, surging up, defiles my days. Foul, helpless, all undone, hope in myself is none: yet bring me forth to sing Thy praise!


[Verse 3] 
Lord, I Thy word believe that I in Thee shall live if I but truly die with Thee. Make Thou me pure in heart, grant me the better part secured by Thine own Blood for me.


[Verse 4] 
Henceforth Thy life is mine and I am wholly Thine, my members under Thy control; kept every day and hour, held by Thy mighty power, Thine while eternal ages roll.
