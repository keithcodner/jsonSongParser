[Verse 1] 
On this assembled host, in this accepted hour, O Spirit, as at Pentecost, descend in all your pow'r! We meet with one accord in our appointed place, and wait the promise of our Lord, the Spirit of all grace.


[Verse 2] 
Like mighty rushing wind upon the waves beneath, move with one impulse ev'ry mind; one soul, one feeling, breathe. Both young and old inspire with wisdom from above; and give us hearts and tongues of fire, to pray and praise and love.


[Verse 3] 
Spirit of light, explore and chase our gloom away, with brightness shining more and more until the perfect day. Spirit of truth, we pray, for ever be our guide; O Spirit of adoption, may we all be sanctified.
