[Verse 1] 
All we like sheep have gone astray Each of us turning our own separate way We have all sinned and fallen short of your glory But your glory is what we desire to see And in your presence is where we long to be


[Verse 2] 
Oh Lord, show us your mercy and grace Take us to your holy place forgive our sin And heal our land We long to live in your presence once again
