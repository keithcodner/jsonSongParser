[Verse 1] 
Along the road of life I have a friend divine Who walks with me and gently leads the way He gives me joy and makes the darkest night to shine It is my Lord, who won my heart one day


[Verse 2] 
I do not mind the through and winding pathway O'er ,mountain step thru valley dark and cold It is enough to know he travels by my side Along the road that leads to steels of gold
