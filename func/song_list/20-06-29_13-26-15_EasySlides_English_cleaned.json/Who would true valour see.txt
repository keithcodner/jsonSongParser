[Verse 1] 
Who would true valour see, let him come hither; one here will constant be, come wind, come weather; there’s no discouragement shall make him once relent his first avowed intent to be a pilgrim.


[Verse 2] 
Who so beset him round with dismal stories, do but themselves confound; His strength the more is. No lion can him fright, he’ll with a giant fight, but he will have a right to be a pilgrim.


[Verse 3] 
Hobgoblin nor foul fiend can daunt his spirit; he knows he at the end shall life inherit. Then fancies flee away; he’ll fear not what men say; he’ll labour night and day to be a pilgrim.
