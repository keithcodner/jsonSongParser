[Verse 1] 
Since I started for the Kingdom, since my life He controls, since I gave my heart to Jesus, the longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.


[Verse 2] 
The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows, the more that I love Him, more love He bestows; each day is like heaven, my heart overflows, the longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows.


[Verse 3] 
Every need He is supplying, plenteous grace He bestows; every day my way gets brighter, the longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.


[Verse 4] 
The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows, the more that I love Him, more love He bestows; each day is like heaven, my heart overflows, the longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows.
