[Verse 1] 
Why so downcast, oh, my soul Put your hope in God Put your hope in God Put your hope in God O, why so downcast, oh, my soul Put your hope in God and bless the Lord oh, my soul


[Verse 2] 
Bless the Lord He's the lifter of my countenance Bless the Lord He's the lifter of my head Bless the Lord He's the lifter of my countenance I will never be ashamed
