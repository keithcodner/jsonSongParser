[Verse 1] 
I love to tell the story of unseen things above, of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love. I love to tell the story because I know ‘tis true. It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.


[Verse 2] 
I love to tell the story! ‘Twill be my theme in glory to tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.


[Verse 3] 
I love to tell the story; more wonderful it seems than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams. I love to tell the story, it did so much for me; and that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.


[Verse 4] 
I love to tell the story! ‘Twill be my theme in glory to tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.


[Verse 5] 
I love to tell the story; ‘tis pleasant to repeat what seems each time I tell it more wonderfully sweet. I love to tell the story, for some have never heard the message of salvation from God’s own holy Word.


[Verse 6] 
I love to tell the story! ‘Twill be my theme in glory to tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.


[Verse 7] 
I love to tell the story, for those who know it best seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest. And when in scenes of glory I sing the new, new song, ‘twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.


[Verse 8] 
I love to tell the story! ‘Twill be my theme in glory to tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.
