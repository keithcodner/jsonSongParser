[Verse 1] 
There is sunshine in my soul today, more glorious and bright than glows in any earthly sky, for Jesus is my light.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine while the peaceful, happy moments roll; when Jesus shows His smiling face, there is sunshine in my soul.


[Verse 3] 
There is music in my soul today, a carol to my King, and Jesus, listening, can hear the song I cannot sing.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine while the peaceful, happy moments roll; when Jesus shows His smiling face, there is sunshine in my soul.


[Verse 5] 
There is spring-time in my soul today, for when the Lord is near, the dove of peace sings in my heart, the flowers of grace appear.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine while the peaceful, happy moments roll; when Jesus shows His smiling face, there is sunshine in my soul.


[Verse 7] 
There is gladness in my soul today, and hope, and praise, and love, for blessings which He gives me now, for joys laid up above.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine while the peaceful, happy moments roll; when Jesus shows His smiling face, there is sunshine in my soul.
