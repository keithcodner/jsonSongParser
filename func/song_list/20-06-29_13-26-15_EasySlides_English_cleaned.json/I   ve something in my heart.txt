[Verse 1] 
I’ve something in my heart that Jesus gave to me, it makes me feel like singing glory all the day: He found my captive soul and gave me liberty, and now I feel like singing glory!


[Verse 2] 
He makes the path grow brighter every passing day; He makes the burden lighter, all along the way; His Word is my delight, His will I now obey, and all the time I’m singing glory!


[Verse 3] 
My Saviour loosed my tongue that I might speak His praise; since then I have been singing glory all the day; I love to tell the lost of Jesus and His ways, and oh, it keeps me singing glory!


[Verse 4] 
He makes the path grow brighter every passing day; He makes the burden lighter, all along the way; His Word is my delight, His will I now obey, and all the time I’m singing glory!


[Verse 5] 
My Saviour took my feet from out the miry clay; since then I have been singing glory all the day: He placed them on the Rock that shall not pass away I cannot keep from singing glory!


[Verse 6] 
He makes the path grow brighter every passing day; He makes the burden lighter, all along the way; His Word is my delight, His will I now obey, and all the time I’m singing glory!


[Verse 7] 
O weary heart and sad, O heavy laden soul, if you would feel like singing glory all the day, just let the Saviour in and let Him take control: then you will feel like singing glory!


[Verse 8] 
He makes the path grow brighter every passing day; He makes the burden lighter, all along the way; His Word is my delight, His will I now obey, and all the time I’m singing glory!
