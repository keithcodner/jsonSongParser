[Verse 1] 
Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart, draw me, my Saviour, so precious Thou art; fold me, oh fold me close to Thy breast, shelter me safe in that haven of Rest.


[Verse 2] 
Nearer, still nearer! Nothing I bring, naught as an offering to Jesus, my King, only my sinful, now contrite heart; grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.


[Verse 3] 
Nearer, still nearer! Lord to be Thine, sin with its follies I gladly resign; all of its pleasures, pomp, and its pride; give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.


[Verse 4] 
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last, till all its struggles and trials are past; then through eternity, ever Iâ€™ll be nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee.   Repeat the last line of each verse
