[Verse 1] 
God is our refuge and our strength, in straits a present aid; therefore, although the earth remove, we will not be afraid.


[Verse 2] 
Though hills amidst the seas be cast; though waters roaring make, and troubled be; yea, though the hills by swelling seas do shake.


[Verse 3] 
A river is, whose streams make glad the city of our God, the holy place, wherein the Lord most high hath his abode.


[Verse 4] 
God in the midst of her doth dwell; nothing shall her remove: God unto her an helper will, and that right early, prove.


[Verse 5] 
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the God whom we adore, be glory, as it was, and is, and shall be evermore. Amen.
