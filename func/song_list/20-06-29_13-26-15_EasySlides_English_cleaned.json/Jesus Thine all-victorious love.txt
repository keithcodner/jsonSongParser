[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Thine all-victorious love shed in my soul abroad; then shall my heart no longer rove, rooted and fixed in God, rooted and fixed in God.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, that in me the sacred fire might now begin to glow, burn up the dross of base desire and make the mountains flow, and make the mountains flow!


[Verse 3] 
Oh, that it now from heaven might fall, and all my sins consume! Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call; Spirit of burning, come, Spirit of burning, come!


[Verse 4] 
Refining fire, go through my heart, illuminate my soul; scatter Thy life through every part, and sanctify the whole, and sanctify the whole.


[Verse 5] 
My steadfast soul, from falling free, shall then no longer move; while Christ is all the world to me, and all my heart is love, and all my heart is love.
