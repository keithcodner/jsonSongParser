[Verse 1] 
He is the mighty God, he is the risen King, he is the Lord of lords. He is the first and last, he is holy, he is true, he is the Lord of lords.


[Verse 2] 
And we know he is coming back again in pow'r and glory. He is coming back again to claim his people; he is coming back again to bring his children home with him, home with him.


[Verse 3] 
He is the One who gave his life for all the world, he is the Lord of lords, who rose up from the grave, defeated death and hell; he is the Lord of lords.


[Verse 4] 
And we know he is coming back again in pow'r and glory. He is coming back again to claim his people; he is coming back again to bring his children home with him, home with him.


[Verse 5] 
He's coming in the clouds and every eye shall see he is the Lord of lords; then every knee shall bow and every tongue proclaim he is the Lord of lords.


[Verse 6] 
And we know he is coming back again in pow'r and glory. He is coming back again to claim his people; he is coming back again to bring his children home with him, home with him.
