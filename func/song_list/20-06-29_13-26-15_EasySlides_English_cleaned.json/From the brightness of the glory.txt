[Verse 1] 
From the brightness of the glory, “Go ye forth,” He said: “Heal the sick and cleanse the lepers, raise the dead.


[Verse 2] 
“Freely give I thee the treasure, freely give the same; take no store of gold or silver take my Name.


[Verse 3] 
“Thou art fitted for the journey, how so long it be: Thou shalt come, unworn, unwearied, back to Me.


[Verse 4] 
“Thou shalt tell Me in the glory all that thou hast done, setting forth alone, returning not alone.


[Verse 5] 
“Thou shalt bring the ransomed with thee, they with songs shall come as the golden sheaves of harvest, gathered home.”
