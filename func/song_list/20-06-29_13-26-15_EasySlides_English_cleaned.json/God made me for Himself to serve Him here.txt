[Verse 1] 
God made me for Himself, to serve Him here, with loveâ€™s pure service and in filial fear; to show His praise, for Him to labour now; then see His glory where the angels bow.


[Verse 2] 
All needful grace was mine through His dear Son, whose life and death my full salvation won; the grace that would have strengthened me, and taught; grace that would crown me when my work was wrought.


[Verse 3] 
And I, poor sinner, cast it all away; lived for the toil or pleasure of each day; as if no Christ had shed His precious blood, as if I owed no homage to my God.


[Verse 4] 
O Holy Spirit, with Thy fire divine, melt into tears this thankless heart of mine; teach me to love what once I seemed to hate, and live to God before it be too late.
