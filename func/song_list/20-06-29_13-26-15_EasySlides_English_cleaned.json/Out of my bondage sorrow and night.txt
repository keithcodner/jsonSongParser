[Verse 1] 
Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night, Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light, Jesus, I come to Thee! Out of my sickness into Thy health, out of my want and into Thy wealth, out of my sin and into Thyself, Jesus, I come to Thee!


[Verse 2] 
Out of my shameful failure and loss, Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! Into the glorious gain of Thy cross, Jesus, I come to Thee! Out of earth’s sorrows into Thy balm, out of life’s storms and into Thy calm, out of distress to jubilant psalm, Jesus, I come to Thee!


[Verse 3] 
Out of unrest and arrogant pride, Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! Into Thy blessed will to abide, Jesus, I come to Thee! Out of myself to dwell in Thy love, out of despair into raptures above, upward for aye on wings like a dove, Jesus, I come to Thee!


[Verse 4] 
Out of the fear and dread of the tomb, Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! Into the joy and light of Thy home, Jesus, I come to Thee! Out of the depths of ruin untold, into the peace of Thy sheltering fold, ever Thy glorious face to behold, Jesus, I come to Thee!
