Now unto the King Eternal Unto the reigning King Unto the Lord Almighty Praises I will sing To the King Eternal Sing to the King of kings Sing to declare His glory Let His praises ring   I will lift my hands in joy before my King I lift my hands in praise I lift my heart in joyful jubilation I lift my voice in praise And I will shout blessings to the King And I will shout glory to the King And I will shout honour to the King And I will shout power to the King   Declaring "Blessing, and glory And honour and power" Belong to Jesus The King of kings
