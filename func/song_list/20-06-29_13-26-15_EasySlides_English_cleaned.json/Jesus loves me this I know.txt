[Verse 1] 
Jesus loves me! this I know, for the Bible tells me so; little ones to Him belong; they are weak, but He is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so!


[Verse 3] 
Jesus loves me! He who died heaven's gates to open wide: He will wash away my sin, let His little child come in.


[Verse 4] 
Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so!

Jesus loves me! He will stay close beside me all the way: if I love Him, when I die He will take me home on high.

Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so!
