[Verse 1] 
O Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end; Be Thou forever near me, My Master and my Friend; I shall not fear the battle If Thou art by my side, Nor wander from the pathway If Thou wilt be my Guide.


[Verse 2] 
O let me feel Thee near me; The world is ever near; I see the sights that dazzle, The tempting sounds I hear; My foes are ever near me, Around me and within; But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, And shield my soul from sin.


[Verse 3] 
O let me hear Thee speaking In accents clear and still, Above the storms of passion, The murmurs of self-will; O speak to reassure me, To hasten, or control; O speak, and make me listen, Thou Guardian of my soul.


[Verse 4] 
O Jesus, Thou hast promised To all who follow Thee That where Thou art in glory There shall Thy servants be; And, Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end; O give me grace to follow My Master and my Friend.


[Verse 5] 
O let me see Thy footmarks, And in them plant mine own; My hope to follow duly Is in Thy strength alone. O guide me, call me, draw me, Uphold me to the end; And then in heaven receive me, My Saviour and my Friend.
