[Verse 1] 
God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform; he plants his footsteps in the sea, and rides upon the storm. Deep in unfathomable mines of never-failing skill, he treasures up his bright designs, and works his sov'reign will.


[Verse 2] 
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take; the clouds ye so much dread are big with mercy, and shall break in blessings on your head.


[Verse 3] 
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, but trust him for his grace; behind a frowning providence he hides a shining face.


[Verse 4] 
His purposes will ripen fast, unfolding ev'ry hour; the bud may have a bitter taste, but sweet will be the flow'r.


[Verse 5] 
Blind unbelief is sure to err, and scan his work in vain; God is his own interpreter, and he will make it plain.
