[Verse 1] 
More about Jesus would I know, more of His grace to others show, more of His saving fullness see, more of His love Who died for me.


[Verse 2] 
More, more about Jesus! More, more about Jesus! More of His saving fullness see, more of His love Who died for me.


[Verse 3] 
More about Jesus let me learn, more of His holy will discern; Spirit of God, my teacher be, showing the things of Christ to me.


[Verse 4] 
More, more about Jesus! More, more about Jesus! More of His saving fullness see, more of His love Who died for me.


[Verse 5] 
More about Jesus in His word, holding communion with my Lord; hearing His voice in every line, making each faithful saying mine.


[Verse 6] 
More, more about Jesus! More, more about Jesus! More of His saving fullness see, more of His love Who died for me.


[Verse 7] 
More about Jesus on His throne, riches in glory all His own, more of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase; more of His coming, Prince of Peace.


[Verse 8] 
More, more about Jesus! More, more about Jesus! More of His saving fullness see, more of His love Who died for me.
