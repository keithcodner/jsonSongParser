[Verse 1] 
We stand redeemed Washed, cleansed and justified You've clothed us Lord With the robes of righteousness We cry to You O Lord To move in our lives In our families And in our towns


[Verse 2] 
Move us on, build us up Strengthen our weal knees We lift our hands and yield ourselves to you Move us on draw us closer Lord in unity We're your servants Lord We long to Your will.
