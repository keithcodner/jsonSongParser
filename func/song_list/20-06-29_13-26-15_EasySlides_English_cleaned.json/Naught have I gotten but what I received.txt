[Verse 1] 
Naught have I gotten but what I received; grace hath bestowed it since I have believed; boasting excluded, pride I abase; I’m only a sinner saved by grace!


[Verse 2] 
Only a sinner saved by grace! Only a sinner saved by grace! This is my story; to God be the glory, I’m only a sinner saved by grace!


[Verse 3] 
Once, I was foolish and sin ruled my heart, causing my footsteps from God to depart; Jesus hath found me, happy my case, I now am a sinner saved by grace!


[Verse 4] 
Only a sinner saved by grace! Only a sinner saved by grace! This is my story; to God be the glory, I’m only a sinner saved by grace!


[Verse 5] 
Tears unavailing, no merit had I; mercy had saved me, or else I must die; sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face; but now I’m a sinner saved by grace!


[Verse 6] 
Only a sinner saved by grace! Only a sinner saved by grace! This is my story; to God be the glory, I’m only a sinner saved by grace!


[Verse 7] 
Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows, loving his Saviour, to tell what he knows; once more to tell it, would I embrace I’m only a sinner saved by grace.


[Verse 8] 
Only a sinner saved by grace! Only a sinner saved by grace! This is my story; to God be the glory, I’m only a sinner saved by grace!
