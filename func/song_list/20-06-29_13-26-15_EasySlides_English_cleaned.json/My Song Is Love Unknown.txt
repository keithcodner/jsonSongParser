[Verse 1] 
My song is love unknown, My Saviour's love to me: Love to the loveless shown, That they might lovely be. O who am I, that for my sake My Lord should take frail flesh and die?


[Verse 2] 
He came from His blessed throne, Salvation to bestow; But men made strange, and none The longed-for Christ would know: But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed, Who at my need His life did spend.


[Verse 3] 
Sometimes they strew His way, And His sweet praises sing; Resounding all the day Hosannas to their King: Then 'Crucify!' is all their breath, And for His death they thirst and cry.


[Verse 4] 
They rise and needs will have My dear Lord made away; A murderer they save, The Prince of life they slay, Yet cheerful He to suffering goes, That He His foes from thence might free.


[Verse 5] 
In life no house, no home My Lord on earth might have; In death, no friendly tomb, But what a stranger gave. What may I say? Heaven was His home; And mine the tomb wherein He lay.


[Verse 6] 
Here might I stay and sing, No story so divine; Never was love, dear King! Never was grief like Thine. This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise I all my days could gladly spend.
