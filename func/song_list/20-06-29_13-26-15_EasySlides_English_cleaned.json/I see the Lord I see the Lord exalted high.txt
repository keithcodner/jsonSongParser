[Verse 1] 
I see the Lord, I see the Lord exalted high upon the worship of the people of the earth; I see the Lord, I see the Lord, my eyes have seen the King, the Lamb upon the throne who reigns for evermore.   The train of his robe fills the temple - a cloud of heavenly worshippers surrounding his throne; we join with them now crying, “Holy, holy is the Lamb, the Lamb alone”.   I see the Lord, I see the Lord exalted high upon the worship of the people of the earth; I see the Lord, I see the Lord, my eyes have seen the King, the Lamb upon the throne who reigns for evermore.
