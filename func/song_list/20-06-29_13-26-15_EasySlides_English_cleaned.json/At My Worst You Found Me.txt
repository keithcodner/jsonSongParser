[Verse 1] 
At my worst You found me At my worst You died As my worst You loved me At my worst You tried to tell me That the best thing I could do Would be to give my life to You At my worst You loved me And now I love You too


[Verse 2] 
How could You love me Jesus? How did You know my name? Why did You save me Jesus? Oh I'll never know Why You loved me so And I'll never see What You saw in me
