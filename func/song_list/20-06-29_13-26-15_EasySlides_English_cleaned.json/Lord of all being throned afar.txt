[Verse 1] 
Lord of all being, throned afar, Thy glory flames from sun and star; centre and soul of every sphere, yet to each loving heart how near.


[Verse 2] 
Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray sheds on our path the glow of day; Star of our hope, Thy softened light cheers the long watches of the night.


[Verse 3] 
Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn, our noontide is Thy gracious dawn, our rainbow arch Thy mercyâ€™s sign; all, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.


[Verse 4] 
Lord of all life, below, above, whose light is truth, whose warmth is love, before Thy ever-blazing throne we ask no lustre of our own.


[Verse 5] 
Grant us Thy truth to make us free, and kindling hearts that burn for Thee, till all Thy living altars claim one holy light, one heavenly flame.
