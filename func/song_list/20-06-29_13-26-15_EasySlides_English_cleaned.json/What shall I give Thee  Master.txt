[Verse 1] 
What shall I give Thee, Master? Thou who did'st die for me. Shall I give less of what I possess, or shall I give all to Thee?


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, my Lord and Saviour, Thou hast given all for me; Thou did'st leave Thy home above to die on Calvary. What shall I give Thee, Master? Thou hast given all for me; Not just a part or half of my heart, I will give all to Thee.


[Verse 3] 
What shall I give Thee, Master? Thou hast redeemed my soul; my gift is small but it is my all surrendered to Thy control.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, my Lord and Saviour, Thou hast given all for me; Thou did'st leave Thy home above to die on Calvary. What shall I give Thee, Master? Thou hast given all for me; Not just a part or half of my heart, I will give all to Thee.


[Verse 5] 
What shall I give Thee, Master? Giver of gifts divine! I will not hold time, talents or gold For everything shall be Thine.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus, my Lord and Saviour, Thou hast given all for me; Thou did'st leave Thy home above to die on Calvary. What shall I give Thee, Master? Thou hast given all for me; Not just a part or half of my heart, I will give all to Thee.
