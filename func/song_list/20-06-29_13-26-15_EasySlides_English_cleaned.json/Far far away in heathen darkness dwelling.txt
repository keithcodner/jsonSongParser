[Verse 1] 
Far, far away in heathen darkness dwelling, millions of souls for ever may be lost; who, who will go, salvation's story telling, looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?


[Verse 2] 
“All power is given unto Me! All power is given unto Me! Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel; and, lo, I am with you always.”


[Verse 3] 
See o'er the world, wide open doors inviting: soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in! Christians, awake! your forces all uniting, send forth the gospel, break the chains of sin.


[Verse 4] 
“All power is given unto Me! All power is given unto Me! Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel; and, lo, I am with you always.”


[Verse 5] 
“Why will ye die?” the voice of God is calling; “Why will ye die?” re-echo in His Name: Jesus hath died to save from death appalling; life and salvation, therefore, go proclaim.


[Verse 6] 
“All power is given unto Me! All power is given unto Me! Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel; and, lo, I am with you always.”


[Verse 7] 
God speed the day when those of every nation, “Glory to God!” triumphantly shall sing; ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation, shout, “Hallelujah, for the Lord is King!”


[Verse 8] 
“All power is given unto Me! All power is given unto Me! Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel; and, lo, I am with you always.”
