[Verse 1] 
Hark! The herald angels sing: 'Glory to the new-born King! Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled!'   Joyful, all ye nations rise, Join the triumph of the skies, With the angelic host proclaim, 'Christ is born in Bethlehem.'   Hark! the herald angels sing: 'Glory to the new-born King!'


[Verse 2] 
Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord, Late in time behold Him come, Offspring of a virgin's womb.   Veiled in flesh the Godhead see! Hail the incarnate Deity! Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel.   Hark! the herald angels sing: 'Glory to the new-born King.'


[Verse 3] 
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace! Hail, the Sun of righteousness! Light and life to all He brings, Risen with healing in His wings,   Mild, He lays His glory by; Born that men no more may die; Born to raise the sons of earth; Born to give them second birth.   Hark! the herald angels sing: 'Glory to the new-born King.'
