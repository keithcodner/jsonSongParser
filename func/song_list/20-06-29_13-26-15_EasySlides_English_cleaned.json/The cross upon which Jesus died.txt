[Verse 1] 
The cross upon which Jesus died is a shelter in which we can hide; and its grace so free is sufficient for me, and deep is its fountain as wide as the sea.


[Verse 2] 
There’s room at the cross for you, there’s room at the cross for you; though millions have come, there’s still room for one, yes, there’s room at the cross for you.


[Verse 3] 
Though millions have found Him a friend and have turned from the sins they have sinned, the Saviour still waits to open the gates and welcome a sinner before it’s too late.


[Verse 4] 
There’s room at the cross for you, there’s room at the cross for you; though millions have come, there’s still room for one, yes, there’s room at the cross for you.


[Verse 5] 
The hand of my Saviour is strong, and the love of my Saviour is long; through sunshine or rain, through loss or in gain, the blood flow from Calvary to cleanse every stain.


[Verse 6] 
There’s room at the cross for you, there’s room at the cross for you; though millions have come, there’s still room for one, yes, there’s room at the cross for you.
