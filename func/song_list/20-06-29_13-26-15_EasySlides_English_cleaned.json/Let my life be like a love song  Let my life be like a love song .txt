[Verse 1] 
Let my life be like a love song, Let my life be like a love song, Let my life be like a love song, To your heart. (x2)


[Verse 2] 
Lord the love You give, You give so generously, You were my sacrifice, You gave Your life for me. And now I want to give Just as I've received, To live a life that shines Your love for those in need

Let my life be like a love song, Let my life be like a love song, Let my life be like a love song, To your heart. (x2)

So let justice roll Like an endless stream, Flowing through my life To the poor and weak. Let the things I do And the words I speak Reveal the awesome love You have shown for me.


[Verse 5] 
Let my life be like a love song, Let my life be like a love song, Let my life be like a love song, To your heart. (x2)
