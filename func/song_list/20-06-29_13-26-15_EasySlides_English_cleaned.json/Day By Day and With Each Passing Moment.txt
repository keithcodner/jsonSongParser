[Verse 1] 
Day by day, and with each passing moment, Strength I find to meet my trials here; Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment. I've no cause for worry or for fear.   He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure, Gives unto each day what He deems best, Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure, Mingling toil with peace and rest. 


[Verse 2] 
Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me, With a special mercy for each hour; All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me. He whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.   The protection of His child and treasure Is a charge that on Himself He laid; 'As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,' - This the pledge to me He made.
