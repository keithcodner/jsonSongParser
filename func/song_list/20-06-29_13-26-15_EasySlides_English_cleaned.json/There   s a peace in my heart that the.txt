[Verse 1] 
There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave, a peace it can not take away; though the trials of life may surround like a cloud, I’ve a peace that has come there to stay.


[Verse 2] 
Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine; constantly abiding, rapture divine; He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O so kind: “I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.


[Verse 3] 
All the world seemed to sing of a Saviour and King, when peace sweetly came to my heart; troubles all fled away and my night turned to day, blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!


[Verse 4] 
Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine; constantly abiding, rapture divine; He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O so kind: “I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.


[Verse 5] 
This treasure I have in a temple of clay, while here on His footstool I roam; but He’s coming to take me some glorious day, over there to my heavenly home!


[Verse 6] 
Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine; constantly abiding, rapture divine; He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O so kind: “I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.
