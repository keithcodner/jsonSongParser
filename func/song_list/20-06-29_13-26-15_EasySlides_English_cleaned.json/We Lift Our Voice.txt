We lift our voices We lift our hands We lift our lives up to you We are an offering Lord, use our voices Lord, use our hands Lord, use our lives, they are yours We are an offering

All that we have, all that we are All that we hope to be We give to you We give to you


[Verse 3] 
We lift our voices We lift our hands We lift our lives up to you We are an offering, We are an offering
