[Verse 1] 
She only touched the hem of His garment as to His side she stole, amid the crowd that gathered around Him, and straightway she was whole.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, touch the hem of His garment, and thou, too, shalt be free; His saving power this very hour shall give new life to thee.


[Verse 3] 
She came in fear and trembling before Him, she knew her Lord had come; she felt that from Him virtue had healed her, the mighty deed was done.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, touch the hem of His garment, and thou, too, shalt be free; His saving power this very hour shall give new life to thee.


[Verse 5] 
He turned with, “Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole”; and peace that passeth all understanding with gladness filled her soul.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, touch the hem of His garment, and thou, too, shalt be free; His saving power this very hour shall give new life to thee.
