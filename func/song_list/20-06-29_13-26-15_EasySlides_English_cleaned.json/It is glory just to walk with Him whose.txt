[Verse 1] 
It is glory just to walk with Him whose blood has ransomed me; it is rapture for my soul each day. It is joy divine to feel Him near where’er my path may be. Bless the Lord, it’s glory all the way!


[Verse 2] 
It is glory just to walk with Him. It is glory just to walk with Him. He will guide my steps aright, through the vale and o’er the height. It is glory just to walk with Him.


[Verse 3] 
It is glory when the shadows fall, to know that He is near. Oh, what joy to simply trust and pray! It is glory to abide in Him when skies above are clear. Yes, with Him, it’s glory all the way!


[Verse 4] 
It is glory just to walk with Him. It is glory just to walk with Him. He will guide my steps aright, through the vale and o’er the height. It is glory just to walk with Him.


[Verse 5] 
‘Twill be glory when I walk with Him on heaven’s golden shore, never from His side again to stray. ‘Twill be glory, wondrous glory with the Saviour ever-more, everlasting glory all the way!


[Verse 6] 
It is glory just to walk with Him. It is glory just to walk with Him. He will guide my steps aright, through the vale and o’er the height. It is glory just to walk with Him.
