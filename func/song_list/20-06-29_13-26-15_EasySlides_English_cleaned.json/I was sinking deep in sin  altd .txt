[Verse 1] 
I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore, very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more; but the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry, from the waters lifted me: now safe am I.


[Verse 2] 
Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!) Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!) When nothing else could help, love lifted me!


[Verse 3] 
All my heart to him I give; ever to him I'll cling, in his blessed presence live, ever his praises sing. Love so mighty and so true merits my soul's best songs; faithful, loving service, too, to him belongs.


[Verse 4] 
Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!) Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!) When nothing else could help, love lifted me!


[Verse 5] 
Souls in danger, look above; Jesus completely saves; he will lift you by his love out of the angry waves. He's the Master of the sea, billows his will obey; he your Saviour wants to be - be saved today.


[Verse 6] 
Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!) Love lifted me! (Love lifted even me!) When nothing else could help, love lifted me!
