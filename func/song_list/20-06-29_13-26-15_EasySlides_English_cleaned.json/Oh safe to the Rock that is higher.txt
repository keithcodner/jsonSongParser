[Verse 1] 
Oh, safe to the Rock that is higher than I, my soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly; so sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be; Thou blessed Rock of Ages, I’m hiding in Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee, Thou blest Rock of Ages, I’m hiding in Thee.


[Verse 3] 
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour, in times when temptation casts o’er me its power; in the tempests of life, on its wide heaving sea, Thou blest Rock of Ages, I’m hiding in Thee.


[Verse 4] 
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee, Thou blest Rock of Ages, I’m hiding in Thee.


[Verse 5] 
How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe, I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe; how often when trials like sea billows roll, have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.


[Verse 6] 
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee, Thou blest Rock of Ages, I’m hiding in Thee.
