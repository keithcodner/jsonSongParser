[Verse 1] 
Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart, naught be all else to me, save that thou art; thou my best thought in the day and the night, waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.


[Verse 2] 
Be thou my wisdom, be thou my true word, I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord; thou my great Father and I thy true heir; thou in me dwelling, and I in thy care.


[Verse 3] 
Be thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight, be thou my armour and be thou my might, thou my soul's shelter, and thou my high tow'r, raise thou me heav'nward, O Pow'r of my pow'r.


[Verse 4] 
Riches I need not, nor all the world's praise, thou my inheritance through all my days; thou, and thou only, the first in my heart, high King of heaven, my treasure thou art!


[Verse 5] 
High King of heaven, when battle is done, grant heaven's joys to me, O bright heav'n's sun; Christ of my own heart, whatever befall, still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
