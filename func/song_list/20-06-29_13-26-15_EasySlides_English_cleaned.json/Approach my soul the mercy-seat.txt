[Verse 1] 
Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat, where Jesus answers prayer; there humbly fall before His feet, for none can perish there.


[Verse 2] 
Thy promise is my only plea; with this I venture nigh; Thou callest burdened souls to Thee, and such, O Lord, am I.


[Verse 3] 
Bowed down beneath a load of sin, by Satan sorely pressed, by wars without, and fears within, I come to Thee for rest.


[Verse 4] 
Be Thou my shield and hiding-place, that, sheltered near Thy side, I may my fierce accuser face, and tell Him Thou hast died.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, wondrous love! to bleed and die, to bear the Cross and shame, that guilty sinners, such as I, might plead Thy gracious Name.
