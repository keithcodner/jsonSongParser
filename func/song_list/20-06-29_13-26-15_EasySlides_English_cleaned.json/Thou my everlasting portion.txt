[Verse 1] 
Thou my everlasting portion, more than friend or life to me, all along my pilgrim journey, Saviour, let me walk with Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, all along my pilgrim journey, Saviour, let me walk with Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Not for ease or worldly pleasure, not for fame my prayer shall be; gladly will I toil and suffer, only let me walk with Thee.


[Verse 4] 
Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, all along my pilgrim journey, Saviour, let me walk with Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Lead me through this vale of shadows, bear me o’er life’s fitful sea; then the gate of life eternal may I enter, Lord, with Thee.


[Verse 6] 
Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, all along my pilgrim journey, Saviour, let me walk with Thee.
