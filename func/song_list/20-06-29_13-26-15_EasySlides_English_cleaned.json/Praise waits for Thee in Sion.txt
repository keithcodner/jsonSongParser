[Verse 1] 
Praise waits for Thee in Zion, Lord to Thee vows paid shall be. Thou that The hearer art of prayer, all flesh shall come to Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Iniquities, I must confess, prevail against me do: but as for our transgressions, them purge away shalt Thou.


[Verse 3] 
Blessed is the man whom Thou dost choose, and makest approach to Thee, that he within Thy courts, O Lord, may still a dweller be.


[Verse 4] 
We surely shall be satisfied with Thy abundant grace, and with the goodness of Thy house, even of Thy holy place.


[Verse 5] 
O God of our salvation, Thou, in Thy righteousness, by fearful works unto our prayers, Thine answer dost express.


[Verse 6] 
Therefore the ends of all the earth, and those afar that be upon the sea, their confidence, O Lord, will place in Thee.
