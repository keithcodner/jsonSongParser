[Verse 1] 
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole, I want You for ever to live in my soul: break down every idol, cast out every foe: now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 2] 
Whiter than snow, whiter than snow; now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow


[Verse 3] 
Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain, apply Your own blood and extract every stain; to get this blest cleansing I all things forego: now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 4] 
Whiter than snow, whiter than snow; now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow


[Verse 5] 
Lord Jesus, look down from Your throne in the skies, and help me to make a complete sacrifice; I give up myself and whatever I know: now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 6] 
Whiter than snow, whiter than snow; now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow


[Verse 7] 
Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat; I wait, blessed Lord, at Your crucified feet; by faith for my cleansing I see Your blood flow: now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 8] 
Whiter than snow, whiter than snow; now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow


[Verse 9] 
Lord Jesus, You see that I patiently wait; come now, and within me a clean heart create: to those who have sought You , You never said, No: now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


[Verse 10] 
Whiter than snow, whiter than snow; now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
