[Verse 1] 
In loving-kindness Jesus came, my soul in mercy to reclaim, and from the depths of sin and shame through grace He lifted me.


[Verse 2] 
From sinking sand He lifted me; with tender hand He lifted me; from shades of night to plains of light, O praise His name, He lifted me!


[Verse 3] 
He called me long before I heard, before my sinful heart was stirred; but when I took Him at His word, forgiven He lifted me.


[Verse 4] 
From sinking sand He lifted me; with tender hand He lifted me; from shades of night to plains of light, O praise His name, He lifted me!


[Verse 5] 
His brow was pierced with many a thorn, His hands by cruel nails were torn, when from my guilt and grief, forlorn, in love He lifted me.


[Verse 6] 
From sinking sand He lifted me; with tender hand He lifted me; from shades of night to plains of light, O praise His name, He lifted me!


[Verse 7] 
Now on a higher plane I dwell, and with my soul I know â€˜tis well; yet how or why, I cannot tell, He should have lifted me.


[Verse 8] 
From sinking sand He lifted me; with tender hand He lifted me; from shades of night to plains of light, O praise His name, He lifted me!
