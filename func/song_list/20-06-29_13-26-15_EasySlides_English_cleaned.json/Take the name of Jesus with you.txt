[Verse 1] 
Take the name of Jesus with you, child of sorrow and of woe; it will joy and comfort give you - take it then where’er you go.


[Verse 2] 
Precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven; precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven.


[Verse 3] 
Take the name of Jesus ever, as a shield from every snare; if temptations round you gather, breathe that holy name in prayer.


[Verse 4] 
Precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven; precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, the precious name of Jesus! How it thrills our souls with joy, when His loving arms receive us, and His songs our tongues employ!


[Verse 6] 
Precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven; precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven.


[Verse 7] 
At the name of Jesus bowing, falling prostrate at His feet; King of kings in heaven we’ll crown Him, when our journey is complete.


[Verse 8] 
Precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven; precious name, oh, how sweet! hope of earth and joy of heaven.
