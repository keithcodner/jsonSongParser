[Verse 1] 
I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus No turning back, no turning back.


[Verse 2] 
The world behind me, the cross before me The world behind me, the cross before me The world behind me, the cross before me No turning back, no turning back.


[Verse 3] 
Though none go with me, I still will follow Though none go with me, I still will follow Though none go with me, I still will follow No turning back, no turning back.


[Verse 4] 
Will you decide now to follow Jesus? Will you decide now to follow Jesus? Will you decide now to follow Jesus? No turning back, no turning back.
