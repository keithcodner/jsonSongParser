[Verse 1] 
Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free; force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be. I sink in life's alarms when by myself I stand; imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.


[Verse 2] 
My heart is weak and poor until its master find; it has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind. It cannot freely move, 'til Thou hast wrought its chain; enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.


[Verse 3] 
My power is faint and low till I have learned to serve; it wants the needed fire to glow, it wants the breeze to nerve; it cannot drive the world, until itself be driven; its flag can only be unfurled when Thou shalt breathe from heaven.


[Verse 4] 
My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine; if it would reach a monarch's throne it must its crown resign; it only stands unbent, amid the clashing strife, when on Thy bosom it has leant and found in Thee its life.
