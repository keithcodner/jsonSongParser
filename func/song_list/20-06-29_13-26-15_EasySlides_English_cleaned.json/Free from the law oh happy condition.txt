[Verse 1] 
Free from the law, oh, happy condition, Jesus hath bled, and there is remission, cursed by the law and bruised by the fall, grace hath redeemed us once for all.


[Verse 2] 
Once for all, oh sinner receive it, once for all, oh, brother believe it; cling to the Cross, the burden will fall, Christ hath redeemed us once for all.


[Verse 3] 
Now are we free, there’s no condemnation, Jesus provides a perfect salvation; “Come unto Me,” oh, hear His sweet call, come, and He saves us once for all.


[Verse 4] 
Once for all, oh sinner receive it, once for all, oh, brother believe it; cling to the Cross, the burden will fall, Christ hath redeemed us once for all.


[Verse 5] 
“Children of God,” oh, glorious calling, surely His grace will keep us from falling; passing from death to life at His call, blessed salvation once for all.


[Verse 6] 
Once for all, oh sinner receive it, once for all, oh, brother believe it; cling to the Cross, the burden will fall, Christ hath redeemed us once for all.
