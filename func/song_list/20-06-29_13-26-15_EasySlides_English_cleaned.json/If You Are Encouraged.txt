[Verse 1] 
If you are encouraged in our union with Christ Finding consolation in His love. Compassion, warmth and friendship in the Spirit's flow of life This is how you make my joy complete


[Verse 2] 
By being of the same mind And loving with the same love United in the Spirit With the same goal in sight By being of the same mind And loving with the same love United in the Spirit To the glory of Christ


[Verse 3] 
Be sure you do nothing out of selfishness or pride Never seeing past your own concerns But humbly keep your interests Of each other in your hearts Seeing them as better than yourselves


[Verse 4] 
By being of the same mind And loving with the same love United in the Spirit With the same goal in sight By being of the same mind And loving with the same love United in the Spirit To the glory of Christ
