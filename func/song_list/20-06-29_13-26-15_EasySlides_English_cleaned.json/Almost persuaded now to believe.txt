[Verse 1] 
“Almost persuaded” now to believe; “Almost persuaded” Christ to receive. seems now some soul to say? “Go, Spirit, go Thy way: some more convenient day on Thee I’ll call.”


[Verse 2] 
“Almost persuaded”: come, come today! “Almost persuaded”: turn not away! Jesus invites you here, angels are lingering near, prayers rise from hearts so dear, O wanderer, come!


[Verse 3] 
“Almost persuaded”: harvest is past! “Almost persuaded”: doom comes at last! “Almost” can not avail; “Almost” is but to fail, sad, sad, that bitter wail, “Almost” - but lost!
