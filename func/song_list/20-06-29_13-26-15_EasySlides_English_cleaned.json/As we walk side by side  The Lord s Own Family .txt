[Verse 1] 
As we walk side by side And as His love becomes our guide We will join hands and be one family Because God's love is what the world should see


[Verse 2] 
We are the Lord's own family Our love is what the world should see And as we use His love to Build each other up We're building the Lord's own family We're building the Lord's own family


[Verse 3] 
As we build each other up He fills our hearts with His love We will join hands so all the world can see We are the Lord's own family


[Verse 4] 
We are the Lord's own family Our love is what the world should see And as we use His love to Build each other up We're building the Lord's own family We're building the Lord's own family
