[Verse 1] 
I stand before you Lord And give you all my praise Your love is all I need Jesus, you're all I need My life belongs to you You gave your life for me Your grace is all I need Jesus, you're all I need   Hold me in your arms Never let me go I want to spend eternity with you


[Verse 2] 
And now that you're near Everything is different Everything's so different I know I'm not the same My life is changed I want to be with you I want to be with you
