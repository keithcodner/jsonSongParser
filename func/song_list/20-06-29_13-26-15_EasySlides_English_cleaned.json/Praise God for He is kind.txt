Praise God, for He is kind: His mercy lasts for aye. Give thanks with heart and mind to God of gods alway:


[Verse 2] 
For certainly His mercies dure most firm and sure eternally.


[Verse 3] 
The Lord of lords praise ye, whose mercies still endure. Great wonders only He doth work by His great power:


[Verse 4] 
For certainly His mercies dure most firm and sure eternally.


[Verse 5] 
Give praise to His great name, who, by His wisdom high, the heaven above did frame, and built the lofty sky:


[Verse 6] 
For certainly His mercies dure most firm and sure eternally.


[Verse 7] 
Who hath remembered us when in our low estate; and hath delivered us from foes who did us hate:


[Verse 8] 
For certainly His mercies dure most firm and sure eternally.


[Verse 9] 
Who to all flesh gives food; for His grace faileth never. Give thanks to God most good, the God of heaven, for ever:


[Verse 10] 
For certainly His mercies dure most firm and sure eternally.
