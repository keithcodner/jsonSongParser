[Verse 1] 
Sinners Jesus will receive! Sound this word of grace to all who the heavenly pathway leave, all who linger, all who fall!


[Verse 2] 
Sing it o’er and o’er again, Christ receiveth sinful men; make the message clear and plain, Christ receiveth sinful men.


[Verse 3] 
Come and He will give you rest; trust Him for His word is plain; He will take the sinfulest; Christ receiveth sinful men.


[Verse 4] 
Sing it o’er and o’er again, Christ receiveth sinful men; make the message clear and plain, Christ receiveth sinful men.


[Verse 5] 
Now my heart condemns me not, pure before the law I stand; He who cleansed me from all spot satisfied its last demand.


[Verse 6] 
Sing it o’er and o’er again, Christ receiveth sinful men; make the message clear and plain, Christ receiveth sinful men.


[Verse 7] 
Christ receiveth sinful men, even me with all my sin; purged from every spot and stain, Heaven with Him I enter in.


[Verse 8] 
Sing it o’er and o’er again, Christ receiveth sinful men; make the message clear and plain, Christ receiveth sinful men.
