[Verse 1] 
Jesus, the very thought of thee With sweetness fills the breast; But sweeter far Thy face to see, And in Thy presence rest.


[Verse 2] 
Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, Nor can the memory find A sweeter sound than Thy blessed name, O Saviour of mankind!


[Verse 3] 
O hope of every contrite heart, O joy of all the meek, To those who fall how kind Thou art, How good to those who seek!


[Verse 4] 
But what to those who find? Ah, this Nor tongue nor pen can show: The love of Jesus, what it is None but His loved ones know.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus, Thy mercies are untold Through each returning day; Thy love exceeds a thousandfold Whatever we can say.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus, our only joy be Thou, As Thou our prize wilt be; Jesus, be Thou our glory now, And through eternity.
