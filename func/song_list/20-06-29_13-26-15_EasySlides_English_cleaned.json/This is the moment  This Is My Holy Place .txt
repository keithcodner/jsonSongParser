[Verse 1] 
This is the moment, This is the hour, You're here in My presence, You're touching My power, How I've longed for this moment, How I've longed for this day, Come away My beloved, To our secret place, Enter into My presence, Enter into My mercy and grace.


[Verse 2] 
This is My holy place, This is My secret place, Receive My love and grace, As we stand face to face, Now let My healing flow, I want the world to know, This is My secret place, This is My Holy place.


[Verse 3] 
If you listen you'll hear it, A call to the nations, To show forth My praises, To ev'ry tongue tribe and nation, If you will not tell them, How will they know, That there's joy in My presence, Like they've never known, Bring them into My presence, Let them worship before My throne.


[Verse 4] 
This is Your holy place, This is Your secret place, We feel Your love and grace, As we stand face to face, Lord let Your healing flow, So all the world will know, That there is peace, There is love, There is joy, There is praise,


[Verse 5] 
Here in Your holy place, This is Your secret place, This is Your holy place.
