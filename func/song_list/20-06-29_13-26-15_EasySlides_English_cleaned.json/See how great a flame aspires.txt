[Verse 1] 
See how great a flame aspires, kindled by a spark of grace! Jesus' love the nations fires, sets the kingdoms on a blaze. To bring fire on earth He came; kindled in some hearts it is; O that all might catch the flame, all partake the glorious bliss!


[Verse 2] 
When He first the work begun, small and feeble was His day; now the word doth swiftly run, now it wins its widening way; more and more it spreads and grows ever mighty to prevail; sin's strongholds it now o'erthrows, shakes the trembling gates of hell.


[Verse 3] 
Sons of God, your Saviour praise! He the door hath opened wide; He hath given the word of grace, Jesus' word is glorified; Jesus, mighty to redeem, He alone the work hath wrought; worthy is the work of Him, Him who spake a world from nought.


[Verse 4] 
Saw ye not the cloud arise, little as a human hand? Now it spreads along the skies, hangs o'er all the thirsty land: lo! the promise of a shower drops already from above; but the Lord will shortly pour all the Spirit of His love!
