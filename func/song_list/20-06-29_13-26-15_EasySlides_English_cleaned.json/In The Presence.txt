[Verse 1] 
In the presence of a holy God there's new meaning now to grace; you took all my sins upon yourself, I can only stand amazed.


[Verse 2] 
And I cry holy, holy, holy God, how awesome is your name. Holy, holy, holy God, how majestic is your name, and I am changed in the presence of a holy God.


[Verse 3] 
In the presence of your infinite might, I'm so small and frail and weak; when I see your pow'r and wisdom, Lord, I have no words left to speak.


[Verse 4] 
And I cry holy, holy, holy God, how awesome is your name. Holy, holy, holy God, how majestic is your name, and I am changed in the presence of a holy God.


[Verse 5] 
In the presence of your glory all my crowns lie in the dust. You are righteous in your judgements, Lord, you are faithful, true and just.


[Verse 6] 
And I cry holy, holy, holy God, how awesome is your name. Holy, holy, holy God, how majestic is your name, and I am changed in the presence of a holy God.
