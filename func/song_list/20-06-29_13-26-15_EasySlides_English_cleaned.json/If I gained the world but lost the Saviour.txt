[Verse 1] 
If I gained the world but lost the Saviour, were my life worth living for a day? Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort in the things that soon must pass away? If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour, would my gain be worth the life-long strife? Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing for a moment with a Christ-filled life?


[Verse 2] 
Had I wealth and love in fullest measure, and a name revered both far and near, yet no hope beyond, no harbour waiting where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer - if I gained the world, but lost the Saviour, who endured the cross and died for me, could then all the world afford a refuge, whither in my anguish I might flee?


[Verse 3] 
O what emptiness without the Saviour mid the sins and sorrows here below! And eternity, how dark without Him, only night and tears and endless woe! What though I might live without the Saviour, when I come to die, how would it be? O to face the valley’s gloom without Him! And without Him all eternity!


[Verse 4] 
O the joy of having all in Jesus! What a balm the broken heart to heal! Ne’er a sin so great but He’ll forgive it, nor a sorrow that He does not feel! If I have but Jesus, only Jesus, nothing else in all the world beside, O then everything is mine in Jesus - for my needs and more He will provide.
