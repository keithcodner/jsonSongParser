[Verse 1] 
I will go in the strength of the Lord, in the path He hath marked for my feet, I will follow the light of His word, nor shrink from the dangers I meet. His presence my steps shall attend; His fullness my wants shall supply; on Him, till my journey shall end, my hope shall securely rely.


[Verse 2] 
I will go in the strength of the Lord, to the work He appoints me to do; in the joy which His smile shall afford my soul shall her vigour renew. His power will protect me from harm, His grace my sufficiency prove; I will trust His omnipotent arm, I will rest in His covenant love.


[Verse 3] 
I will go in the strength of the Lord to each conflict which faith may require; His grace as my shield and reward, my courage and zeal shall inspire. If He issue the word of command to meet and encounter the foe, though with sling and with stone in my hand, in the strength of the Lord I will go.
