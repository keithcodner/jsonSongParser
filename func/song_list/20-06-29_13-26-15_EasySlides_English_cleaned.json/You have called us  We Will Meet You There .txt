[Verse 1] 
You have called us to Your table Love is waiting there Spread before us heaven's table Tenderly prepared Broken there the bread of life Flowing there the healing wine


[Verse 2] 
We will meet You there and we'll find grace to help in time of need, O .. We will meet You there and seek Your face, bowing on our knees And we'll cry "holy, holy, holy" We will meet You there.


[Verse 3] 
All are welcome at Your table Hope is waiting there Whosoever to Your table Find Your tender care Broken there the bread of life Flowing there the healing wine.


[Verse 4] 
We will meet You there and we'll find grace to help in time of need, O .. We will meet You there and seek Your face, bowing on our knees And we'll cry "holy, holy, holy" We will meet You there.
