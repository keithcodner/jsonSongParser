[Verse 1] 
Once I thought I walked with Jesus, yet such changeful feelings had: sometimes trusting, sometimes doubting, sometimes joyful, sometimes sad.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, what peace my Saviour gives, peace I never knew before! How my way has brighter grown, since I learned to trust Him more.


[Verse 3] 
For He called me closer to Him, bade my doubting, fearing cease and, when I had fully yielded, filled my soul with perfect peace.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, what peace my Saviour gives, peace I never knew before! How my way has brighter grown, since I learned to trust Him more.


[Verse 5] 
Now I'm trusting every moment, nothing less can be enough; and my Saviour bears me gently, o'er the places once so rough.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, what peace my Saviour gives, peace I never knew before! How my way has brighter grown, since I learned to trust Him more.


[Verse 7] 
Day by day my soul He's keeping, by His wondrous power within; and my heart is full of singing to my Saviour from all sin.


[Verse 8] 
Oh, what peace my Saviour gives, peace I never knew before! How my way has brighter grown, since I learned to trust Him more.
