[Verse 1] 
Jesus is the answer, for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way. Jesus is the answer, for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way.


[Verse 2] 
If you have some questions in the corners of your mind, Traces of discouragement and peace you cannot find; Reflections of your past seem to face you every day, But this one thing I do know; Jesus is the way.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is the answer, for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way. Jesus is the answer, for the world today, Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way.
