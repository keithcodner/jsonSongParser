[Verse 1] 
I have a precious Book, it's the Word of God. It's the only Book that God has giv'n. As I read, God speaks to me, I see Christ and Calvary. The Wonderful Word of God.


[Verse 2] 
Forever it will stand as the ages roll, It's the living and eternal Word. It's my guiding light each day, and without it I would stray; The Wonderful Word of God.


[Verse 3] 
Dear Lord may I each day read Thy precious Word. May I love it and obey it too. May I grow to be like Thee. May my friends see Christ in me. In Jesus' Name, Amen.
