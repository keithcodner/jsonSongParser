[Verse 1] 
Lo, He comes with clouds descending, Once for favoured sinners slain; Thousand thousand saints attending Swell the triumph of His train: Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! God appears on earth to reign.


[Verse 2] 
Every eye shall now behold Him Robed in glorious majesty; Those who set at naught and sold Him, Pierced and nailed Him to the tree, Deeply wailing, Deeply wailing, Deeply wailing, Shall their true Messiah see.


[Verse 3] 
Those dear tokens of His passion Still His dazzling body bears; Cause of endless exultation To His ransomed worshippers: With what rapture, With what rapture, With what rapture, Gaze we on those glorious scars.


[Verse 4] 
Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee, High on Thine eternal throne; Saviour, take the power and glory, Claim the kingdom for Thine own: Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus! Everlasting God, come down!
