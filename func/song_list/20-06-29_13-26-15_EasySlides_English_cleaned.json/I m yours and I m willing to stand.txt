[Verse 1] 
I'm yours, and I'm willing to stand, I'm yours, I am at your command; I'm yours, I want you to know that I will do anything for you.


[Verse 2] 
I'm yours, I'm a soldier for you, I'm yours, show me what I can do; I'm yours, I want you to know that I will do anything for you.


[Verse 3] 
I want to work for you, my Lord, I want to make a difference in this world. I want to work for you, my Lord, I want to make a difference in this world.


[Verse 4] 
I'm yours, and I'm willing to stand, I'm yours, I am at your command; I'm yours, I want you to know that I will do anything for you.


[Verse 5] 
I'm yours!
