[Verse 1] 
Everlasting love how can it be? Suffered, tortured and cried in pain for me? Nailed hands and nailed feet as I weep Droplets of your love, covers me 


[Verse 2] 
And I can't believe, that you still call me your child And I can't understand, how such eternal love is true Nailed to the cross, laid your live for me How can one like me deserve such love?


[Verse 3] 
Everlasting love how can it be Suffered tortured, cried in pain for me? Crown of thorns scar your eyes and brows you cant see Gasping lungs fight for air, you just cant breathe


[Verse 4] 
And I can't believe, that you still call me your child And I can't understand, how such eternal love is true Nailed to the cross, laid your live for me How can one like me deserve such love?
