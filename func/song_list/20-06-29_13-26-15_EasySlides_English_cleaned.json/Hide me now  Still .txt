[Verse 1] 
Hide me now Under your wings Cover me within your mighty hand


[Verse 2] 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar I will soar with You above the storm Father you are king over the flood i will be still and know you are God


[Verse 3] 
Find rest my soul In Christ alone Know his power in quietness and trust
