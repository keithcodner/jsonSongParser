[Verse 1] 
God is calling the prodigal, come without delay, hear, oh, hear Him calling, calling now for thee; though you’ve wandered so far from His presence, come today, hear His loving voice calling still.


[Verse 2] 
Calling now for thee, oh! weary prodigal come, calling now for thee, oh! weary prodigal come.


[Verse 3] 
Patient, loving and tenderly still the Father pleads, hear, oh, hear Him calling, calling now for thee; oh! return while the Spirit in mercy intercedes hear His loving voice calling still.


[Verse 4] 
Calling now for thee, oh! weary prodigal come, calling now for thee, oh! weary prodigal come.


[Verse 5] 
Come, there’s bread in the house of thy Father, and to spare, hear, oh, hear Him calling, calling now for thee; lo! The table is spread and the feast is waiting there, hear His loving voice calling still.


[Verse 6] 
Calling now for thee, oh! weary prodigal come, calling now for thee, oh! weary prodigal come.
