[Verse 1] 
Lord, you know how much I wanna know so much In the way of answers And explanation I have cried and prayed And still I seem to stay In the middle of life's, complications   All this pursuing Leaves me feeling like I'm chasing down the wind But now its brought me back to you And I can see again


[Verse 2] 
This is everything I want This is everything I need I want this to be my one Consuming passion Everything my heart desires Lord I want it all to be for you Jesus Be my magnificent obsession


[Verse 3] 
So capture my heart again Take me to depths I've never been Into the riches of your grace and your mercy Return me to the cross Let me be completely lost In the wonder of the love That you've shown me   Cut through these chains that tie me down To so many lesser things Let all my chains fall to the ground Until this one remains


[Verse 4] 
You are everything I want And you are everything I need Lord, you are all my heart desires You are everything to me
