[Verse 1] 
Come, let us join our cheerful songs With angels round the throne; Ten thousand thousand are their tongues, But all their joys are one.


[Verse 2] 
'Worthy the Lamb that died,' they cry, 'To be exalted thus.' 'Worthy the Lamb,' our lips reply, 'For He was slain for us.'


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is worthy to receive Honour and power divine: And blessings, more than we can give, Be, Lord, forever Thine.


[Verse 4] 
Let all that dwell above the sky, And air, and earth, and seas, Conspire to lift Thy glories high, And speak Thine endless praise.


[Verse 5] 
The whole creation join in one To bless the sacred name Of Him that sits upon the throne And to adore the Lamb.
