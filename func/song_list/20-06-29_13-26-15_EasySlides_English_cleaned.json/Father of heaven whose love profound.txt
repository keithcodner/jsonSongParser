[Verse 1] 
Father of heav'n, whose love profound a ransom for our souls has found: before your throne we sinners bend - to us your pard'ning love extend.


[Verse 2] 
Almighty Son, incarnate Word, our prophet, priest, redeemer, Lord: before your throne we sinners bend - to us your saving grace extend.


[Verse 3] 
Eternal Spirit, by whose breath the soul is raised from sin and death: before your throne we sinners bend - to us your living power extend.


[Verse 4] 
Transcendent Father, Spirit, Son - mysterious Godhead, three in one: before your throne we sinners bend - grace, pardon, life to us extend.
