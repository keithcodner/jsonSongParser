[Verse 1] 
I want, dear Lord, a heart that’s true and clean; a sunlit heart, with not a cloud between; a heart like Thine, a heart divine, a heart as white as snow; on me, dear Lord, a heart like this bestow.


[Verse 2] 
I want, dear Lord, a love that feels for all; a deep, strong love that answers every call; a love like Thine, a love divine, a love for high and low; on me, dear Lord, a love like this bestow.


[Verse 3] 
I want, dear Lord, a soul on fire for Thee; a soul baptised with heavenly energy, a willing mind, a ready hand, to do whate’er I know, to spread Thy light wherever I may go.


[Verse 4] 
I want, dear Lord, a faith that looks to Thee to cheer the way when naught but clouds I see; a faith sublime, a faith divine, a faith that will not fail to trust in Thee and over sin prevail.


[Verse 5] 
I want, dear Lord, a hope steadfast and sure, a hope that holds to things that will endure; a hope in heaven, a hope in Thee, a hope that’s bright and clear, dispelling doubt and conquering every fear.
