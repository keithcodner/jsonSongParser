[Verse 1] 
No eye has seen, And no ear has heard, And no mind has ever conceived The glorious things That You have prepared For everyone who has believed; You brought us near and You called us Your own, And made us joint heirs with Your Son.


[Verse 2] 
How high and how wide, How deep and how long, How sweet and how strong is Your love; How lavish Your grace, How faithful Your ways, How great is Your love, O Lord.


[Verse 3] 
Objects of mercy, Who should have known wrath, We're filled with unspeakable joy; Riches of wisdom Unsearchable wealth, And the wonder of knowing Your voice. You are our treasure and our great reward, Our hope and our glorious King.


[Verse 4] 
How high and how wide, How deep and how long, How sweet and how strong is Your love; How lavish Your grace, How faithful Your ways, How great is Your love, O Lord.
