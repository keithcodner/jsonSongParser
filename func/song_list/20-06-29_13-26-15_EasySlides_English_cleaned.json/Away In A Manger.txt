[Verse 1] 
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head; The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay; The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.


[Verse 2] 
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes, But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes: I love You, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky And stay by my side until morning is nigh.


[Verse 3] 
Be near me, Lord Jesus: I ask You to stay Close by me forever and love me, I pray; Bless all the dear children in Your tender care, And fit us for heaven to live with You there.
