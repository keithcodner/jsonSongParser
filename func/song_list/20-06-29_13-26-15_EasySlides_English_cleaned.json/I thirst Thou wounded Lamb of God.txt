[Verse 1] 
I thirst, Thou wounded Lamb of God, to wash me in Thy cleansing blood; to dwell within Thy wounds; then pain is sweet, and life or death is gain.


[Verse 2] 
Take my poor heart, and let it be for ever closed to all but Thee; seal Thou my breast, and let me wear that pledge of love for ever there.


[Verse 3] 
How blest are they who still abide close sheltered in Thy bleeding side! Who life and strength from thence derive, and by Thee move, and in Thee live.


[Verse 4] 
What are our works but sin and death, till Thou Thy quickening Spirit breathe? Thou givest the power, Thy grace doth move: O wondrous grace! O boundless love!


[Verse 5] 
Ah, Lord, enlarge our scanty thought to know the wonders Thou hast wrought; unloose our stammering tongues to tell Thy love immense, unsearchable.
