[Verse 1] 
After Thy loving-kindness, Lord, have mercy upon me: for Thy compassions great, blot out all mine iniquity.


[Verse 2] 
Me cleanse from sin, and throughly wash from mine iniquity: for my transgressions I confess; my sin I ever see.


[Verse 3] 
‘Gainst Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, in Thy sight done this ill; that when Thou speak’st Thou may’st be just, and clear in judging still.


[Verse 4] 
Behold, I in iniquity was formed the womb within; My mother also me conceived in guiltiness and sin.


[Verse 5] 
Behold, Thou in the inward parts with truth delighted art; and wisdom Thou shalt make me know within the hidden part.


[Verse 6] 
Do Thou with hyssop sprinkle me, I shall be cleansed so; yea, wash Thou me, and then I shall be whiter than the snow.
