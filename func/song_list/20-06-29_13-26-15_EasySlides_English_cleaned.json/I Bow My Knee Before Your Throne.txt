[Verse 1] 
I bow my knee before Your throne, I know my life is not my own; I offer up a song of praise, To bring You pleasure, Lord.   I seek the Giver, not the gift, My heart's desire is to lift You, High above all earthly kings; To bring You pleasure Lord.   Hallelujah, hallelujah; Hallelujah, glory to the King! Hallelujah, hallelujah; Hallelujah, glory to the King!
