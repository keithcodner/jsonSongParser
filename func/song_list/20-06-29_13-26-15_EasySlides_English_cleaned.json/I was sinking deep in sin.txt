[Verse 1] 
I was sinking deep in sin, sinking to rise no more, overwhelmed by guilt within, mercy I did implore. Then the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry, Christ my Saviour lifted me, now safe am I.


[Verse 2] 
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When no one but Christ could help, love lifted me! Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When no one but Christ could help, love lifted me!


[Verse 3] 
Souls in danger, look above, Jesus completely saves; He will lift you by His love out of the angry waves. Heâ€™s the Master of the sea, billows His will obey; He your Saviour wants to be, be saved today!


[Verse 4] 
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When no one but Christ could help, love lifted me! Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When no one but Christ could help, love lifted me!


[Verse 5] 
When the waves of sorrow roll, when I am in distress, Jesus takes my hand in His, ever He loves to bless. He will every fear dispel, satisfy every need; all who heed His loving call, find rest indeed.


[Verse 6] 
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When no one but Christ could help, love lifted me! Love lifted me! Love lifted me! When no one but Christ could help, love lifted me!
