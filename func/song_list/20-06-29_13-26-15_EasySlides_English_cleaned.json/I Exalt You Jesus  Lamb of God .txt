[Verse 1] 
I exalt You Jesus, my sacrifice I exalt You my Redeemer and my Lord I exalt You, worthy Lamb of God And in honour I bow down before Your throne.


[Verse 2] 
Lamb of God, Holy one, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Lifted up, willingly to die, that I the guilty one May know the blood once shed Still freely flowing, still cleansing, still healing


[Verse 3] 
I exalt You Jesus, my sacrifice I exalt You my Redeemer and my Lord I exalt You, worthy Lamb of God And in honour I bow down before Your throne.
