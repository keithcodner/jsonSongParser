[Verse 1] 
Here I am, humbled by your majesty, covered by your grace so free. Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man, covered by the blood of the Lamb. Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine, since you laid down your life, the greatest sacrifice.


[Verse 2] 
Majesty, majesty. Your grace has found me just as I am, empty-handed but alive in your hands.


[Verse 3] 
Here I am, humbled by the love that you give, forgiven so that I can forgive. Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire, sanctified by glory and fire. Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine, since you laid down your life, the greatest sacrifice.


[Verse 4] 
Majesty, majesty. Your grace has found me just as I am, empty-handed but alive in your hands.


[Verse 5] 
Majesty, majesty. Forever I am changed by your love, in the presence of your majesty.


[Verse 6] 
Majesty, majesty. Your grace has found me just as I am, empty-handed but alive in your hands.
