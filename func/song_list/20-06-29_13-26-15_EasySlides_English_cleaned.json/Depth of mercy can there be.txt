[Verse 1] 
Depth of mercy! can there be mercy still reserved for me? Can my God His wrath forbear? Me, the chief of sinners, spare?


[Verse 2] 
I have long withstood His grace, long provoked Him to His face; would not hearken to His calls, grieved Him by a thousand falls.


[Verse 3] 
Whence to me this waste of love? Ask my Advocate above! See the cause in Jesusâ€™ face, now before the throne of grace.


[Verse 4] 
There for me the Saviour stands, shows His wounds and spreads His hands: God is love, I know, I feel: Jesus lives, and loves me still.


[Verse 5] 
If I rightly read Thy heart, if Thou all compassion art, bow Thine ear, in mercy bow, pardon and accept me now!
