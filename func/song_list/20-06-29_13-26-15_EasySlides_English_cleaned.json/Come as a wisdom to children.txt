[Verse 1] 
Come, as a wisdom to children, come, as new sight to the blind, come, Lord, as strength to my weakness; take me; soul, body and mind.


[Verse 2] 
Come, Holy Spirit, I need Thee, come, sweet Spirit, I pray; come, in Thy strength and Thy power, come in Thine own gentle way.


[Verse 3] 
Come a rest to the weary, come as a balm for the sore, come, as a dew to my dryness; fill me with joy, evermore.


[Verse 4] 
Come, Holy Spirit, I need Thee, come, sweet Spirit, I pray; come, in Thy strength and Thy power, come in Thine own gentle way.


[Verse 5] 
Come, like a spring in the desert, come, to the withered of soul; oh, let Thy sweet healing power touch me, and make me whole.


[Verse 6] 
Come, Holy Spirit, I need Thee, come, sweet Spirit, I pray; come, in Thy strength and Thy power, come in Thine own gentle way.
