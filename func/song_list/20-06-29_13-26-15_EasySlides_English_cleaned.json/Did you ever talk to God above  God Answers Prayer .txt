[Verse 1] 
Did you ever talk to God above Telling Him you need a friend to love Pray in Jesus' name believing that God answers prayer.


[Verse 2] 
Have you told Him all your cares and worries Every tiny little fear He knows You can know He'll always hear And He will answer prayer


[Verse 3] 
You can whisper in a crowd to Him You can cry when you're alone to Him You don't have to pray out loud to Him He knows your thoughts


[Verse 4] 
On a lofty mountain peak, He's there In a meadow by a stream, He's there Anywhere on earth you go He's been there from the start


[Verse 5] 
Find the answer in His Word, it's true You'll be strong because He walks with you By faithfulness He'll changes you too God answers prayer
