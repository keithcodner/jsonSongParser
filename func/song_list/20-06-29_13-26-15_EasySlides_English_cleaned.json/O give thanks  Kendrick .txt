[Verse 1] 
O give thanks to the Lord, for his love will never end. O give thanks to the Lord, for his love it never will end. (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
Sing to him, sing your praise to him. Tell the world of all he has done. Fill the nations with celebrations, to welcome him as he comes.


[Verse 3] 
O give thanks to the Lord, for his love will never end. O give thanks to the Lord, for his love it never will end. (Repeat)


[Verse 4] 
Give him thanks for the fruitful earth, for the sun, the seasons, the rain. For the joys of his good creation, the life and breath he sustains.


[Verse 5] 
O give thanks to the Lord, for his love will never end. O give thanks to the Lord, for his love it never will end. (Repeat)


[Verse 6] 
Let the heavens rejoice before him, the earth and all it contains. All creation in jubilation, join in the shout, 'The Lord reigns!'


[Verse 7] 
O give thanks to the Lord, for his love will never end. O give thanks to the Lord, for his love it never will end. (Repeat)


[Verse 8] 
Let the hearts of those who seek him be happy now in his love. Let their faces look up and gaze at his gracious smile from above.


[Verse 9] 
O give thanks to the Lord, for his love will never end. O give thanks to the Lord, for his love it never will end. (Repeat)
