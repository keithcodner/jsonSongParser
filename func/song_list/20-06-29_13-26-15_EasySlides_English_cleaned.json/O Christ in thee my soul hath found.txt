[Verse 1] 
O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found, and found in Thee alone, the peace, the joy, I sought so long, the bliss till now unknown.


[Verse 2] 
Now none but Christ can satisfy, none other Name for me! There’s love, and life, and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in Thee!


[Verse 3] 
I sighed for rest and happiness, I yearned for them, not Thee, but while I passed my Saviour by, His love laid hold on me.


[Verse 4] 
Now none but Christ can satisfy, none other Name for me! There’s love, and life, and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in Thee!


[Verse 5] 
I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, but, ah! the waters failed! E’en as I stooped to drink they fled and mocked me as I wailed.


[Verse 6] 
Now none but Christ can satisfy, none other Name for me! There’s love, and life, and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in Thee!


[Verse 7] 
The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, but never wept for Thee, till grace the sightless eyes received Thy loveliness to see.


[Verse 8] 
Now none but Christ can satisfy, none other Name for me! There’s love, and life, and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in Thee!
