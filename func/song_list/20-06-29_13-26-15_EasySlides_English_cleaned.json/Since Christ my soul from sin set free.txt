[Verse 1] 
Since Christ my soul from sin set free, this world has been a heaven to me; amid earth’s sorrows and its woe, ‘tis heaven my Jesus here to know.


[Verse 2] 
O hallelujah, yes, ‘tis heaven! ‘Tis heaven to know my sins forgiven; on land or sea, what matters where, where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there.


[Verse 3] 
Once heaven seemed a far-off place, till Jesus showed His smiling face; now it’s begun within my soul, ‘twill last while endless ages roll.


[Verse 4] 
O hallelujah, yes, ‘tis heaven! ‘Tis heaven to know my sins forgiven; on land or sea, what matters where, where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there.


[Verse 5] 
What matters where on earth we dwell - on mountain top, or in the dell, in cottage, or a mansion fair? Where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there.


[Verse 6] 
O hallelujah, yes, ‘tis heaven! ‘Tis heaven to know my sins forgiven; on land or sea, what matters where, where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there.
