[Verse 1] 
In your presence there is fullness of life, And healing flowing for body, soul and mind. God of miracles, God of the impossible is here, God is here.


[Verse 2] 
God is here, let the broken-hearted rejoice. God is here, let the sick say 'I am well.' God is here, let the weak say 'I am strong.' God is here,His wonders to perform.


[Verse 3] 
In your presence there is perfect peace; In the stillness I behold Your deity. God of wonder, God of power is here, God is here.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, His wonders, yes, His wonders, His wonders to perform. Oh, His wonders, yes, His wonders, His wonders to perform. (Repeat)
