[Verse 1] 
Breathe upon us, Lord, from heaven, fill us with the Holy Ghost; promise of the Father given, send us now a Pentecost.


[Verse 2] 
Breathe upon us, breathe upon us, with Thy love our hearts inspire; breathe upon us, breathe upon us, Lord, baptise us now with fire.


[Verse 3] 
While the Spirit hovers oâ€™er us, open all our hearts, we pray; to Thine image, Lord, restore us, witness in our souls today.


[Verse 4] 
Breathe upon us, breathe upon us, with Thy love our hearts inspire; breathe upon us, breathe upon us, Lord, baptise us now with fire.


[Verse 5] 
From all sin grant us exemption, wash us in the cleansing flood; let us know the full redemption purchased for us by the blood.


[Verse 6] 
Breathe upon us, breathe upon us, with Thy love our hearts inspire; breathe upon us, breathe upon us, Lord, baptise us now with fire.


[Verse 7] 
Lift us, Lord, oh, lift us higher, from the carnal mind set free; fill us with refining fire, give us perfect liberty.


[Verse 8] 
Breathe upon us, breathe upon us, with Thy love our hearts inspire; breathe upon us, breathe upon us, Lord, baptise us now with fire.
