[Verse 1] 
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us O'er the world's tempestuous sea; Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us, For we have no help but Thee; Yet possessing every blessing If our God our Father be.


[Verse 2] 
Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us; All our weakness Thou dost know, Thou didst tread this earth before us, Thou didst feel its keenest woe; Tempted, taunted, yet undaunted, Through the desert Thou didst go.


[Verse 3] 
Spirit of our God, descending, Fill our hearts with heavenly joy, Love with every passion blending, Pleasure that can never cloy; Thus provided, pardoned, guided, Nothing can our peace destroy.
