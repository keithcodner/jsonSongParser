[Verse 1] 
Not the grandeur of the mountains, nor the splendour of the sea, can excel the ceaseless wonder of my Saviourâ€™s love to me:


[Verse 2] 
For His love to me is faithful, and His mercy is divine; and His truth is everlasting, and His perfect peace is mine.


[Verse 3] 
Not the streams that fill the valleys, nor the clouds that drift along, can delight me more than Jesus or replace my grateful song:


[Verse 4] 
For His love to me is faithful, and His mercy is divine; and His truth is everlasting, and His perfect peace is mine.


[Verse 5] 
Yet these all convey His beauty and proclaim His power and grace - for they are among the tokens of the love upon His face:


[Verse 6] 
For His love to me is faithful, and His mercy is divine; and His truth is everlasting, and His perfect peace is mine.
