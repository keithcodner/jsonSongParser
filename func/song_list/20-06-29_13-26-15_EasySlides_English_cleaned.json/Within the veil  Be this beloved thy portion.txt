[Verse 1] 
Within the veil: Be this, beloved thy portion within the secret of thy Lord to dwell; beholding Him, until thy face His glory, thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.


[Verse 2] 
Within the veil, for only as thou gazest upon the matchless beauty of His face, canst thou become a living revelation of His great heart of love, His untold grace.


[Verse 3] 
Within the veil, His fragrance poured upon thee, without the veil, that fragrance shed abroad; Within the veil, His hand shall tune the music which sounds on earth the praises of thy Lord.


[Verse 4] 
Within the veil, thy spirit deeply anchored, Thou walkest calm above a world of strife; Within the veil, thy soul with Him united, shall live on earth His resurrection life.
