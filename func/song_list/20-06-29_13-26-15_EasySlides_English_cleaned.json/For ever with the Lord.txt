[Verse 1] 
For ever with the Lord! Amen, so let it be; life from the dead is in that word, ‘tis immortality. Here in the body pent, absent from Him I roam, yet nightly pitch my moving tent, a day’s march nearer home.


[Verse 2] 
My Father’s house on high, home of my soul; how near at times to faith’s foreseeing eye Thy golden gates appear: my thirsty spirit faints to reach the land I love; the bright inheritance of saints, Jerusalem above.


[Verse 3] 
For ever with the Lord! Father, if ‘tis Thy will, the promise of that faithful word e’en here to me fulfil! Be Thou at my right hand, then can I never fail; uphold Thou me so I shall stand, fight, and I must prevail.


[Verse 4] 
So, when my latest breath shall rend the veil in twain, by death I shall escape from death and life eternal gain. Knowing as I am known, how shall I love that word! And oft repeat before the throne: For ever with the Lord!
