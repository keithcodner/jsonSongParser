[Verse 1] 
Oh, who can please the Holy One, who can God's ten commands obey? Besides me you shall have no god, nor turn to images to pray. God's Holy Name, use not in vain, and keep for Him the Sabbath day. Honour your parents, you shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal, you shall not lie, nor covet life your neighbour's way. We all have failed to keep this law, but God in love has made a way; that sinful man could be forgiven, the Christ who lives for us did die. Trust Jesus to forgive your sins, then by His power God's law obey.
