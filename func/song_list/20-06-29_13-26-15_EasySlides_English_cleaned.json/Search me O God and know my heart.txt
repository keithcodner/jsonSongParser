[Verse 1] 
Search me, O God, and know my heart, lead me in your ways for ever. Search me, O God, and know my heart, lead me in your ways for ever.


[Verse 2] 
I want to be holy, giving ev'rything to you. I want to be pure in heart and pure in mind. I want to be holy, always pleasing you, I want to live for you.
