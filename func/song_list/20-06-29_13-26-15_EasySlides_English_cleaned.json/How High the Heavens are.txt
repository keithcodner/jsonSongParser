[Verse 1] 
How High the Heavens are From East to West how far! Wide, wide as the great ocean Is the love you show to those Who fear God Almighty.


[Verse 2] 
Lord, I want to praise you Lord I want to worship you You're the one that I love most You're the one that I love most Praise the Lord of Heaven and earth.
