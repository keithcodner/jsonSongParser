[Verse 1] 
Stand by everything You said Stand by the promises we made Let go of everything I've done I'll run into Your open arms And all I know


[Verse 2] 
I love You more than life I love You more than life


[Verse 3] 
Fall back on everything You've done Fall back on everlasting arms When all the world is swept away You are all the things I need You're the air I breathe


[Verse 4] 
How can it be You were the one on the cross Lifted for all our shame How can it be The scars in Your hands are for me You are the king of all
