[Verse 1] 
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin? The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.


[Verse 2] 
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed? To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.


[Verse 3] 
Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round? In Jesus' presence nought but calm is found.


[Verse 4] 
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away? In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.


[Verse 5] 
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown? Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.


[Verse 6] 
Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours? Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.


[Verse 7] 
It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease, And Jesus calls us to heaven's perfect peace.
