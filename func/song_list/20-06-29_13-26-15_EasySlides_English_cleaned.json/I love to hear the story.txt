[Verse 1] 
I love to hear the story which angel voices tell, how once the King of Glory came down to earth to dwell; I am both weak and sinful, but this I surely know, the Lord came down to save me, because He loved me so.


[Verse 2] 
I’m glad my blessed Saviour was once a child like me, to show how pure and holy His little ones might be; and if I try to follow His footsteps here below, He never will forget me, because He loved me so.


[Verse 3] 
To sing His love and mercy, my sweetest songs I’ll raise, and though I cannot see Him, I know He hears my praise! For He has kindly promised that I shall surely go to sing among His angels, because He loved me so.
