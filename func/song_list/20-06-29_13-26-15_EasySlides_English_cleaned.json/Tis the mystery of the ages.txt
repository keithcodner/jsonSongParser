[Verse 1] 
â€˜Tis the mystery of the ages, hid from prophets, priests and sages, God my seeking heart engages, He stoops down to dwell in me!


[Verse 2] 
Christ in you the hope eternal, tell the world the wondrous story, see Him come, His is the victory! God stoops down to dwell in me!


[Verse 3] 
God is for us; yea, but in us, naught but sin does He take from us,then His life He giveth to us, God stoops down to dwell in me.


[Verse 4] 
We partake of His own nature, thus to grow to His own stature, while beholding Him in rapture, God stoops down to dwell in me!
