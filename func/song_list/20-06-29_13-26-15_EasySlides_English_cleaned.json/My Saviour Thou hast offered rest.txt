[Verse 1] 
My Saviour, Thou hast offered rest: oh! give it, then, to me; the rest of ceasing from myself, to find my all in Thee. This cruel self, oh, how it strives, and works within my breast, to come between Thee and my soul, and keep me back from rest!


[Verse 2] 
How many subtle forms it takes of seeming verity, as if it were not safe to rest and venture all on Thee. O Lord, I seek a holy rest, a victory over sin! I seek that Thou alone shouldst reign o’er all, without, within.


[Verse 3] 
In Thy strong hand I lay me down, so shall the work be done: for who can work so wondrously as Thou, Almighty One! Work on then, Lord, till on my soul eternal light shall break, and, in Thy likeness perfected, I “satisfied” shall wake.
