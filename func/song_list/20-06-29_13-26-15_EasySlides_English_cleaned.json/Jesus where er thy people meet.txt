[Verse 1] 
Jesus, where'er thy people meet, there they behold thy mercy-seat; where'er they seek thee thou art found, and ev'ry place is hallowed ground.


[Verse 2] 
For thou, within no walls confined, inhabitest the humble mind; such ever bring thee when they come, and, going, take thee to their home.


[Verse 3] 
Dear Shepherd of thy chosen few, thy former mercies here renew; here to our waiting hearts proclaim the sweetness of thy saving name.


[Verse 4] 
Here may we prove the pow'r of prayer to strengthen faith and sweeten care, to teach our faint desires to rise, and bring all heav'n before our eyes.


[Verse 5] 
Lord, we are few, but thou art near; nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear; O rend the heav'ns, come quickly down, and make a thousand hearts thine own.
