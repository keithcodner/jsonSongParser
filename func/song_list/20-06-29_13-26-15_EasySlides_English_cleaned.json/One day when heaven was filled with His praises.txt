[Verse 1] 
One day when heaven was filled with His praises, one day when sin was as black as could be, Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin, dwelt amongst men, my example is He!


[Verse 2] 
Living, He loved me; dying He saved me; buried, He carried my sins far away, rising, He justified freely for ever: one day He’s coming: O glorious day.


[Verse 3] 
One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain, one day they nailed Him to die on the tree; suffering anguish, despised and rejected; bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!


[Verse 4] 
Living, He loved me; dying He saved me; buried, He carried my sins far away, rising, He justified freely for ever: one day He’s coming: O glorious day.


[Verse 5] 
One day they left Him alone in the garden, one day He rested, from suffering free; angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil; hope of the hopeless, my Saviour is He!


[Verse 6] 
Living, He loved me; dying He saved me; buried, He carried my sins far away, rising, He justified freely for ever: one day He’s coming: O glorious day.


[Verse 7] 
One day the grave could conceal Him no longer, one day the stone rolled away from the door; then He arose, over death He had conquered; now is ascended, my Lord evermore!


[Verse 8] 
Living, He loved me; dying He saved me; buried, He carried my sins far away, rising, He justified freely for ever: one day He’s coming: O glorious day.


[Verse 9] 
One day the trumpet will sound for His coming, one day the skies with His glory will shine; wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing; glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!


[Verse 10] 
Living, He loved me; dying He saved me; buried, He carried my sins far away, rising, He justified freely for ever: one day He’s coming: O glorious day.
