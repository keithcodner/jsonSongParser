[Verse 1] 
Jesus lives! Thy terrors now Can, O death, no more appal us; Jesus lives! by this we know, Thou, O grave, canst not enthral us. Hallelujah!


[Verse 2] 
Jesus lives! henceforth is death But the gate of life immortal; This shall calm our trembling breath, When we pass its gloomy portal. Hallelujah!


[Verse 3] 
Jesus lives! for us He died; Then, alone to Jesus living, Pure in heart may we abide, Glory to our Saviour giving. Hallelujah!


[Verse 4] 
Jesus lives! our hearts know well, Naught from us His love shall sever; Life, nor death, nor powers of hell, Tear us from His keeping ever. Hallelujah!


[Verse 5] 
Jesus lives! to Him the throne Over all the world is given: May we go where He is gone, Rest and reign with Him in heaven. Hallelujah!
