[Verse 1] 
Oh, for a life to please my God, in every little thing, a holy life, that day by day to Him will glory bring!


[Verse 2] 
A life lived only unto Him, no double aim in view, the outcome of a Christ-like heart, by God made pure and new.


[Verse 3] 
A life which Jesus guides alone, o'er which He has control! A life which others seeing, say that Jesus owns the whole.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, complete Thy work in me, the work Thou hast begun: each day may I grow more like Thee, until my race is run.
