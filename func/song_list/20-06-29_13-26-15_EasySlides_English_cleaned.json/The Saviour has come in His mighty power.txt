[Verse 1] 
The Saviour has come in His mighty power, And spoken peace to my soul, And all of my life from that very hour I've yielded to His control, I've yielded to His control.


[Verse 2] 
Wonderful, wonderful, marvellous and wonderful, what He has done for my soul! The half has never been told; oh, it is wonderful, it is marvellous and wonderful, what Jesus has done for this soul of mine! The half has never been told!


[Verse 3] 
From glory to glory He leads me on, from grace to grace every day, and brighter and brighter the glory dawns while pressing my homeward way, while pressing my homeward way.


[Verse 4] 
Wonderful, wonderful, marvellous and wonderful, what He has done for my soul! The half has never been told; oh, it is wonderful, it is marvellous and wonderful, what Jesus has done for this soul of mine! The half has never been told!


[Verse 5] 
If fellowship here with my Lord can be so inexpressibly sweet, O what will it be when His face we see, when round the white throne we meet, when round the white throne we meet.


[Verse 6] 
Wonderful, wonderful, marvellous and wonderful, what He has done for my soul! The half has never been told; oh, it is wonderful, it is marvellous and wonderful, what Jesus has done for this soul of mine! The half has never been told!
