[Verse 1] 
Not a sound invades the stillness, not a form invades the scene, save the voice of my Beloved and the person of my King.


[Verse 2] 
Precious, gentle, holy Jesus! Blessed Bridegroom of my heart, in Thy secret inner chamber, Thou wilt whisper what Thou art.


[Verse 3] 
And within those heavenly places, calmly hushed in sweet repose, there I drink, with joy absorbing all the love Thou wouldst disclose.


[Verse 4] 
Precious, gentle, holy Jesus! Blessed Bridegroom of my heart, in Thy secret inner chamber, Thou wilt whisper what Thou art.


[Verse 5] 
Wrapped in deep adoring silence, Jesus, Lord, I dare not move, lest I lose the smallest saying meant to catch the ear of love.


[Verse 6] 
Precious, gentle, holy Jesus! Blessed Bridegroom of my heart, in Thy secret inner chamber, Thou wilt whisper what Thou art.


[Verse 7] 
Rest then, O my soul, contented: Thou hast reached thy happy place, in the bosom of thy Saviour, gazing up in His dear face.   In Tune two, the chorus is only sung after verses 2 & 4.


[Verse 8] 
Precious, gentle, holy Jesus! Blessed Bridegroom of my heart, in Thy secret inner chamber, Thou wilt whisper what Thou art.
