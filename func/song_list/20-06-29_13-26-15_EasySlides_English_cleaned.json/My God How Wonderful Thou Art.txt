[Verse 1] 
My God, how wonderful Thou art, Thy majesty how bright! How beautiful Thy mercy-seat, In depths of burning light!


[Verse 2] 
How dread are Thine eternal years, O everlasting Lord, By prostrate spirits day and night Incessantly adored!


[Verse 3] 
How wonderful, how beautiful The sight of Thee must be, Thine endless wisdom, boundless power, And awesome purity!


[Verse 4] 
O how I fear Thee, living God, With deepest, tenderest fears, And worship Thee with trembling hope And penitential tears!


[Verse 5] 
Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord, Almighty as Thou art, For Thou hast stooped to ask of me The love of my poor heart.


[Verse 6] 
No earthly father loves like Thee; No mother e'er so mild Bears and forbears as Thou hast done With me, Thy sinful child.


[Verse 7] 
Father of Jesus, love's reward, What rapture will it be Prostrate before Thy throne to lie, And gaze, and gaze on Thee.
