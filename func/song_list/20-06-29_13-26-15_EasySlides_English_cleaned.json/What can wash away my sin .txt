[Verse 1] 
What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus! What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
O, precious is the flow, that makes me white as snow! No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


[Verse 3] 
For my pardon this I see. Nothing but the blood of Jesus! for my cleansing, this I plea: Nothing but the blood of Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
O, precious is the flow, that makes me white as snow! No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


[Verse 5] 
Nothing can for sin atone, Nothing but the blood of Jesus! nought of good that I have done, Nothing but the blood of Jesus.


[Verse 6] 
O, precious is the flow, that makes me white as snow! No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


[Verse 7] 
This is all my hope and peace, Nothing but the blood of Jesus! He is all my righteousness, Nothing but the blood of Jesus.


[Verse 8] 
O, precious is the flow, that makes me white as snow! No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
