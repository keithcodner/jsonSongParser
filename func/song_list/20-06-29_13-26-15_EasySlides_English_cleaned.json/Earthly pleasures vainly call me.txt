[Verse 1] 
Earthly pleasures vainly call me, I would be like Jesus; nothing worldly shall enthral me, I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 2] 
Be like Jesus, this my song, in the home and in the throng; be like Jesus, all day long! I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 3] 
He has broken every fetter, I would be like Jesus; that my soul may serve Him better, I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 4] 
Be like Jesus, this my song, in the home and in the throng; be like Jesus, all day long! I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 5] 
All the way from earth to glory, I would be like Jesus; telling o’er and o’er the story, I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 6] 
Be like Jesus, this my song, in the home and in the throng; be like Jesus, all day long! I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 7] 
That in heaven He may meet me, I would be like Jesus; that His words, “Well done”, may greet me I would be like Jesus.


[Verse 8] 
Be like Jesus, this my song, in the home and in the throng; be like Jesus, all day long! I would be like Jesus.
