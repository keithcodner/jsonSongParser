[Verse 1] 
Everybody seems to have A cause for which to speak, Loudly from the roof tops They proclaim the things they seek. Often or a needless cause And often to deceive, Should not we who know the Lord Declare what we believe.


[Verse 2] 
Let the whole world know, We are on God's side (FOREVER!) Let the whole world know, He's a friend and guide (along the pathway!) For in Christ new life we found, And our lives were changed around, Now we travel heaven bound, Let the whole world know!


[Verse 3] 
Let the whole world know, There's a job to do (We'll do it) Let the whole world know, Others need Him too (They surely need Him) Like a brightly shining light, In the darkness of the night, We will stand for truth and right, Let the whole world know.
