[Verse 1] 
Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed! The motion of a hidden fire, that trembles in the breast.


[Verse 2] 
Prayer is the burden of a sigh, the falling of a tear, the upward glancing of an eye, when none but God is near.


[Verse 3] 
Prayer is the simplest form of speech that infant lips can try; prayer, the sublimest strains that reach the Majesty on high.


[Verse 4] 
Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath, the Christian’s native air, his watchword at the gates of death; He enters heaven with prayer.


[Verse 5] 
The saints in prayer appear as one, in word, and deed, and mind; while with the Father and the Son, sweet fellowship they find.


[Verse 6] 
O Thou by Whom we come to God, the Life, the Truth, the Way! The path of prayer Thyself hast trod, Lord, teach us how to pray!
