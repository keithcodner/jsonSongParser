[Verse 1] 
Thou hast snapped my fetters; Thou hast made me free. Liberty and gladness I have found in Thee, liberty from bondage, from my weary load, Satan's slave no longer, now a child of God!


[Verse 2] 
I am Thine Lord Jesus, ever Thine, Thine I am, and my heart is singing, “Glory to the Lamb.”


[Verse 3] 
Living in the sunshine, shining in Thy light, fighting as Thy soldier, mighty in Thy might; going on Thy mission, pointing men to Thee, telling of the Saviour who can set them free.


[Verse 4] 
I am Thine Lord Jesus, ever Thine, Thine I am, and my heart is singing, “Glory to the Lamb.”


[Verse 5] 
Such the life, Lord Jesus, I would ever live, such the grateful tribute I would ever give; witnessing for Thee, Lord, everywhere I go, of the Blood that cleanseth, washing white as snow.


[Verse 6] 
I am Thine Lord Jesus, ever Thine, Thine I am, and my heart is singing, “Glory to the Lamb.”


[Verse 7] 
And when life is ended, when the victory's won, when I hear from Thee, Lord, the glad words, “Well done,” with what joy and rapture shall I sing of Thee, who from sin's dark chains didst set my spirit free!


[Verse 8] 
I am Thine Lord Jesus, ever Thine, Thine I am, and my heart is singing, “Glory to the Lamb.”
