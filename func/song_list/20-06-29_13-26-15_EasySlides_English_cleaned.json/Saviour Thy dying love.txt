[Verse 1] 
Saviour, Thy dying love Thou gavest me, nor should I aught withhold, my Lord, from Thee; in love my soul would bow, my heart fulfil its vow, some offering bring Thee now, something for Thee.


[Verse 2] 
At the blest mercy-seat pleading for me, my feeble faith looks up, Jesus, to Thee: help me the cross to bear, Thy wondrous love declare, some song to raise, or prayer, something for Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Give me a faithful heart, likeness to Thee, that each departing day henceforth may see some work of love begun, some deed of kindness done, some wanderer sought and won, something for Thee.


[Verse 4] 
All that I am and have, Thy gifts so free, in joy, in grief, through life, O Lord, for Thee. And when Thy face I see, my ransomed soul shall be, through all eternity, something for Thee.
