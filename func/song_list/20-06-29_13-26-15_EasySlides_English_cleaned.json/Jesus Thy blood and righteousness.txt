[Verse 1] 
Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness my beauty are, my glorious dress; ‘midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed, with joy shall I lift up my head.


[Verse 2] 
Bold shall I stand in that great day, for who aught to my charge shall lay? Fully absolved through these I am, from sin and fear, from guilt and shame,


[Verse 3] 
When from the dust of death I rise, to claim my mansion in the skies, e’en then shall this be all my plea, “Jesus hath lived, and died, for me.”


[Verse 4] 
This spotless robe the same appears, when ruined nature sinks in years; no age can change its glorious hue, the robe of Christ is ever new.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, let the dead now hear Thy voice, bid, Lord, Thy banished ones rejoice; their beauty this, their glorious dress, Jesus, the Lord our Righteousness!
