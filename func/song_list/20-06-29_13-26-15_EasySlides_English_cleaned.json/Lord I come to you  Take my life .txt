[Verse 1] 
Lord, I come to you, I come to bow before the one whom I adore. All that I am, all that I hope to be is yours.


[Verse 2] 
Take my life, O God, my King. Let it be for you alone. Take my all, my ev'rything, I give it, Lord, to you.


[Verse 3] 
Lord, I know I fail to always walk your way, to follow, come what may. All that I do, all that my future holds is yours.


[Verse 4] 
Take my life, O God, my King. Let it be for you alone. Take my all, my ev'rything, I give it, Lord, to you.
