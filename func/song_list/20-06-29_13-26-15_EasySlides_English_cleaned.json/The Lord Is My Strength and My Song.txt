[Verse 1] 
The Lord is my strength and my song, He has become my salvation, Under the shadow of His wings I belong, I will give thanks to the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
In my trouble I cried to the Lord, He say my distress and He saved me, I will sing praises to You, O my God, For You are my song.


[Verse 3] 
The Lord is my sword and my shield, He saw my distress and He saved me, I will sing praises to You, O MY God, For You are my song.


[Verse 4] 
In my trouble I cried to the Lord, He say my distress and He saved me, I will sing praises to You, O my God, For You are my song.
