[Verse 1] 
Lord, Thee my God, I’ll early seek: my soul doth thirst for Thee; my flesh longs in a dry parched land, wherein no waters be:


[Verse 2] 
That I Thy power may behold, and brightness of Thy face, as I have seen Thee heretofore within Thy holy place.


[Verse 3] 
Since better is Thy love than life, my lips Thee praise shall give. I in Thy name will lift my hands, and bless Thee while I live.


[Verse 4] 
Even as with marrow and with fat my soul shall filled be; then shall my mouth with joyful lips sing praises unto Thee:


[Verse 5] 
When I do Thee upon my bed remember with delight, and when on Thee I meditate in watches of the night.


[Verse 6] 
In shadow of Thy wings I’ll joy, for Thou mine help hast been. My soul Thee follows hard; and me Thy right hand doth sustain.
