[Verse 1] 
From the heart whose cup o'erfloweth, from the crowned life, from the souls made more than conquerors in the midst of strife, rises one glad “Hallelujah” to the King of love, as a fragrance sweet ascending to His throne above.


[Verse 2] 
Praise to Thee who hast redeemed us, O all-glorious King! Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring. Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring.


[Verse 3] 
Praise for all the full deliverance of Thy wondrous Cross, where to death our life we yielded, that most blessed loss. Praise for that deep, boundless ocean of the life in Thee, and the anointing of Thy Spirit which hath set us free.


[Verse 4] 
Praise to Thee who hast redeemed us, O all-glorious King! Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring. Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring.


[Verse 5] 
Praise for all Thy grace untasted lying yet before, and the things past understanding Thou hast kept in store. Praise for life within the Holiest even now begun, for the radiance pure and holy of the unsetting Sun.


[Verse 6] 
Praise to Thee who hast redeemed us, O all-glorious King! Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring. Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring.


[Verse 7] 
But past all the bliss Thou sheddest on the yielded heart, we would praise Thee and adore Thee, Lord, for what Thou art. Evermore in lowly worship bending at Thy feet, till within the gates of glory face to face we meet.


[Verse 8] 
Praise to Thee who hast redeemed us, O all-glorious King! Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring, shall Thy praises ring. Now and through the endless ages shall Thy praises ring.
