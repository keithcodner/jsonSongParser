[Verse 1] 
I stood one day at Calvary where Jesus bled and died, I never knew He loved me so, for me was crucified; and as I stood there in my sin, His love reached down to me, and O the shame that filled my soul that day at Calvary!


[Verse 2] 
I knelt one day at Calvary; my eyes were filled with tears to think such love I had refused through all these wasted years; and as I knelt I heard Him say, “I did it all for thee,” and O the love that filled my soul that day at Calvary!


[Verse 3] 
I prayed one day at Calvary, “I’m Thine for evermore! Forgive me, Lord, for all my sin; my lost estate restore!” And as I prayed, to me He gave salvation full and free, and O the peace that filled my soul that day at Calvary!
