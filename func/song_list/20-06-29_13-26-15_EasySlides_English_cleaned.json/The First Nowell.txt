[Verse 1] 
The first nowell the angel did say Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay; In fields where they lay keeping their sheep, On a cold winter's night that was so deep.


[Verse 2] 
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, Born is the King of Israel!


[Verse 3] 
They look√®d up and saw a star Shining in the east, beyond them far, And to the earth it gave great light, And so it continued both day and night.


[Verse 4] 
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, Born is the King of Israel!


[Verse 5] 
And by the light of that same star Three wise men came from country far; To seek for a King was their intent, And to follow the star wherever it went.


[Verse 6] 
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, Born is the King of Israel!


[Verse 7] 
This star drew nigh to the north-west; Over Bethlehem it took its rest, And there it did both stop and stay Right over the place where Jesus lay.


[Verse 8] 
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, Born is the King of Israel!


[Verse 9] 
Then entered in those wise men three Full reverently upon their knee, And offered there in His presence Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.


[Verse 10] 
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, Born is the King of Israel!


[Verse 11] 
Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord, That hath made heaven and earth of nought, And with His blood mankind hath bought.


[Verse 12] 
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell, Born is the King of Israel!
