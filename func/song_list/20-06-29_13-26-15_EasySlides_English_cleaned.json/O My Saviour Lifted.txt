[Verse 1] 
O my saviour, lifted From the earth for me, Draw me, in Thy mercy, Nearer unto Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Lift my earthbound longings, Fix them, Lord, above; Draw me with the magnet Of Thy mighty love.


[Verse 3] 
And I come, Lord Jesus; Dare I turn away? No! Thy love hath conquered, And I come today.


[Verse 4] 
Bringing all my burdens, Sorrow, sin, and care; At Thy feet I lay them, And I leave them there.
