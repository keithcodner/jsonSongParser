[Verse 1] 
Doubt Him not, although He leadeth other ways than hope had said; all the grace thy spirit needeth dwells in Him. Be not afraid!


[Verse 2] 
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee! Nought I need of other aid; All sufficient Thou, my Saviour! Never will I be afraid.


[Verse 3] 
Fret thee not about the morrow; faint thou not for hope delayed; He will lead, through joy, through sorrow to thy Home. Be not afraid!


[Verse 4] 
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee! Nought I need of other aid; All sufficient Thou, my Saviour! Never will I be afraid.


[Verse 5] 
Does some fierce temptation try thee? Look to Him who bruised its head; see the Conqueror standing by thee; trust in Him. Be not afraid!


[Verse 6] 
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee! Nought I need of other aid; All sufficient Thou, my Saviour! Never will I be afraid.


[Verse 7] 
Faileth all of earth’s reliance? Do thy “vine and fig-tree” fade? Thou canst bid all foes defiance through thy Lord. Be not afraid!


[Verse 8] 
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee! Nought I need of other aid; All sufficient Thou, my Saviour! Never will I be afraid.


[Verse 9] 
Does there come a time of testing, when thine all of strength seems fled? His strength then on thee is resting if thou trust. Be not afraid!


[Verse 10] 
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee! Nought I need of other aid; All sufficient Thou, my Saviour! Never will I be afraid.


[Verse 11] 
Trusting thus and trusting ever, on the Lord Jehovah stayed. Thou at last shalt ford the river safe, through Him. Be not afraid!


[Verse 12] 
I will trust Thee - yes, will trust Thee! Nought I need of other aid; All sufficient Thou, my Saviour! Never will I be afraid.
