[Verse 1] 
Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him? Is not thine a captured heart? Chief among ten thousand own Him, joyful choose the better part.


[Verse 2] 
Idols once they won thee, charmed thee, lovely things of time and sense; gilded thus does sin disarm thee, honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.


[Verse 3] 
What has stript the seeming beauty from the idols of the earth? Not a sense of right or duty, but the sight of peerless worth.


[Verse 4] 
Not the crushing of those idols, with its bitter void and smart; but the beaming of His beauty the unveiling of His heart.


[Verse 5] 
Who extinguishes their taper till they hail the rising sun? Who discards the garb of winter till the summer has begun?


[Verse 6] 
‘Tis that look that melted Peter, ‘tis that face that Stephen saw, ‘tis that heart that wept with Mary, can alone from idols draw:


[Verse 7] 
Draw and win and fill completely, till the cup o’erflow the brim; what have we to do with idols who have companied with Him?
