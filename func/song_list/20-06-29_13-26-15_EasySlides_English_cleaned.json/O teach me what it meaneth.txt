[Verse 1] 
O teach me what it meaneth, that cross uplifted high, with One, the Man of Sorrows, condemned to bleed and die! O teach me what it cost Thee to make a sinner whole; and teach me, Saviour, teach me the value of a soul!


[Verse 2] 
O teach me what it meaneth, that sacred crimson tide, the blood and water flowing from Thine own wounded side. Teach me that if none other had sinned, but I alone, yet still Thy blood, Lord Jesus, Thine only, must atone.


[Verse 3] 
O teach me what it meaneth, Thy love beyond compare, the love that reacheth deeper than depths of self-despair! Yes, teach me, till there gloweth in this cold heart of mine, some feeble, pale reflection of that pure love of Thine.


[Verse 4] 
O teach me what it meaneth, for I am full of sin; and grace alone can reach me, and love alone can win. O teach me, for I need Thee, I have no hope beside, the chief of all the sinners for whom the Saviour died!


[Verse 5] 
O infinite Redeemer! I bring no other plea, because Thou dost invite me I cast myself on Thee. Because Thou dost accept me I love and I adore; because Thy love constraineth, Iâ€™ll praise Thee evermore!
