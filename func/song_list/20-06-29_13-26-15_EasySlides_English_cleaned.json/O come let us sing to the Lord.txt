[Verse 1] 
O come, let us sing to the Lord: come, let us every one a joyful noise make to the Rock of our salvation.


[Verse 2] 
Let us before His presence come with praise and thankful voice; let us sing psalms to Him with grace, and make a joyful noise.


[Verse 3] 
For God, a great God, and great King, above all gods He is. Depths of the earth are in His hand, the strength of hills is His.


[Verse 4] 
To Him the spacious sea belongs, for He the same did make; the dry land also from His hands its form at first did take.


[Verse 5] 
O come, and let us worship Him, let us bow withal, and on our knees before the Lord our Maker let us fall.


[Verse 6] 
For Heâ€™s our God, the people we of His own pasture are, and of His hand the sheep; to-day, if ye His voice will hear.
