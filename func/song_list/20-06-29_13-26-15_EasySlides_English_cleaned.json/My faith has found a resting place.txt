[Verse 1] 
My faith has found a resting place, not in device nor creed; I trust the ever-living One, His wounds for me shall plead.


[Verse 2] 
I need no other argument, I need no other plea, it is enough that Jesus died, and that He died for me.


[Verse 3] 
Enough for me that Jesus saves, this ends my fear and doubt; a sinful soul I come to Him, He’ll never cast me out.


[Verse 4] 
I need no other argument, I need no other plea, it is enough that Jesus died, and that He died for me.


[Verse 5] 
My heart is leaning on the word, the written word of God, salvation by my Saviour’s Name, salvation through His blood.


[Verse 6] 
I need no other argument, I need no other plea, it is enough that Jesus died, and that He died for me.


[Verse 7] 
My great Physician heals the sick, the lost He came to save: for me His precious blood He shed, for me His life He gave.


[Verse 8] 
I need no other argument, I need no other plea, it is enough that Jesus died, and that He died for me.
