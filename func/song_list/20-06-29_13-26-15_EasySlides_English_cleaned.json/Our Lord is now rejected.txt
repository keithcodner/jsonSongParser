[Verse 1] 
Our Lord is now rejected, and by the world disowned; by the many still neglected, and by the few enthroned; but soon He’ll come in glory! The hour is drawing nigh, for the crowning day is coming by and by.


[Verse 2] 
Oh, the crowning day is coming! Is coming by and by! When our Lord shall come in ‘power’ and ‘glory’ from on high! Oh, the glorious sight will gladden each waiting, watchful eye, in the crowning day that’s coming by and by.


[Verse 3] 
The heavens shall glow with splendour; but brighter far than they, the saints shall shine in glory, as Christ shall them array: the beauty of the Saviour shall dazzle every eye, in the crowning day that’s coming by and by.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, the crowning day is coming! Is coming by and by! When our Lord shall come in ‘power’ and ‘glory’ from on high! Oh, the glorious sight will gladden each waiting, watchful eye, in the crowning day that’s coming by and by.


[Verse 5] 
Let all that look for, hasten the coming joyful day, by earnest consecration, to walk the narrow way; by gathering in the lost ones, for whom our Lord did die, for the crowing day that’s comingby and by.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, the crowning day is coming! Is coming by and by! When our Lord shall come in ‘power’ and ‘glory’ from on high! Oh, the glorious sight will gladden each waiting, watchful eye, in the crowning day that’s coming by and by.
