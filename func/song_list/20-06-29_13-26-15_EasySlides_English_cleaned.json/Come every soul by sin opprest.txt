Come, every soul by sin opprest, thereâ€™s mercy with the Lord; and He will surely give you rest, by trusting in His word.


[Verse 2] 
Only trust Him, only trust Him, only trust Him now! He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now!


[Verse 3] 
For Jesus shed His precious blood rich blessings to bestow: plunge now into the crimson flood that washes white as snow.


[Verse 4] 
Only trust Him, only trust Him, only trust Him now! He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now!


[Verse 5] 
Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way that leads you into rest; believe in Him without delay, and you are fully blest.


[Verse 6] 
Only trust Him, only trust Him, only trust Him now! He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now!


[Verse 7] 
Come, then, and join this holy band, and on to glory go, to dwell in that celestial land where joys immortal flow.


[Verse 8] 
Only trust Him, only trust Him, only trust Him now! He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now!
