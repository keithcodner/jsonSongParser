[Verse 1] 
Go forth and tell! O Church of God, awake! God's saving news to all the nations take: proclaim Christ Jesus, Saviour, Lord and King, that all the world His worthy praise may sing.


[Verse 2] 
Go forth and tell! God's love embraces all; He will in grace respond to all who call: how shall they call if they have never heard the gracious invitation of His word?


[Verse 3] 
Go forth and tell! men still in darkness lie; in wealth or want, in sin they live and die: give us, O Lord, concern of heart and mind, a love like Yours which cares for all mankind.


[Verse 4] 
Go forth and tell! the doors are open wide: share God's good gifts - let no one be denied; live out your life as Christ your Lord shall choose, Your ransomed powers for His sole glory use.


[Verse 5] 
Go forth and tell! O church of God, arise! Go in the strength which Christ your Lord supplies; go till all nations His great name adore and serve Him, Lord and King for evermore.
