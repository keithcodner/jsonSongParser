[Verse 1] 
All we've received has come from you All that we have we give back to you Let our lives be a sacrifice, pleasing unto You Let our lips speak Your praises, Let us know Your will


[Verse 2] 
We are your church and we are Your body We are the light the light of the world We are the ones that You have chosen To be the salt of the earth And we're sent to set the captives free
