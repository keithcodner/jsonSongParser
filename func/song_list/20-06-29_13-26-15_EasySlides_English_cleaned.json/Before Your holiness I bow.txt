[Verse 1] 
Before Your holiness I bow, oh Jesus come and cleanse me now, oh come and take away my sin, and purify me deep within. I grieve, I grieve, this dreadful state the evil hid within, I hate, the good I would, but cannot do, I’m left the evil to pursue.


[Verse 2] 
Defiled my very thoughts and mind, within repulsive sin I find. How sinful sickness dissipates, and filthiness makes desolate! Oh where is there escape for me? Where can I find His purity? Oh come Lord Jesus, set me free, And by Your Blood deliver me!


[Verse 3] 
Your Word is surely ever true, and what You promise You will do, so when You claim to purify this must be true; God cannot lie. I come then, Jesus, and I stake my all upon the Word I take. It is enough! God’s Word to me will hold throughout eternity.


[Verse 4] 
I claim in faith; the prayer prevails, and as I trust the Blood avails. Sin’s power is broken, and I know my heart is cleansed as white as snow. The Spirit speaks the Word to me which gives me glorious liberty. And all my heart is Yours to fill, to live for ever in Your will.
