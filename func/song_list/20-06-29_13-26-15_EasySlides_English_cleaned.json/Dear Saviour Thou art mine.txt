[Verse 1] 
Dear Saviour, Thou art mine, how sweet the thought to me! Let me repeat Thy name, and lift my heart to Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Mine! mine! mine! I know Thou art mine; Saviour, dear Saviour, I know Thou art mine.


[Verse 3] 
Thou art the sinnerâ€™s friend, so I Thy friendship claim, a sinner saved by grace, when Thy sweet message came.


[Verse 4] 
Mine! mine! mine! I know Thou art mine; Saviour, dear Saviour, I know Thou art mine.


[Verse 5] 
My hardened heart was touched; Thy pardoning voice I heard; and joy and peace came in while listening to Thy word.


[Verse 6] 
Mine! mine! mine! I know Thou art mine; Saviour, dear Saviour, I know Thou art mine.


[Verse 7] 
So, let me sing Thy praise, so, let me call Thee mine. I cannot doubt Thy word, I know that I am Thine.


[Verse 8] 
Mine! mine! mine! I know Thou art mine; Saviour, dear Saviour, I know Thou art mine.
