[Verse 1] 
When the Lord shall come upon us, and His glory we shall see, sense and know His power within us, feel His perfect liberty; when the Lord our love possesses, and His love pervades the whole, how we easily surrender, oh how Jesus fills the soul.


[Verse 2] 
When He has our every portion and His blood has touched the heart, cleansed, - we gaze and gaze upon Him, can it be! My Lord, my God! How I love Him! Oh I love Him! How I clasp that matchless Name! Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus! King of kings! To me He came.


[Verse 3] 
Oh I bend in adoration, Jesus Thou dost flood my soul! Jesus fills the very heavens, He the Way, the Life, the Goal. He the Saviour; His the glory! Mortals worship! Angels! All! Jesus, Jesus only Jesus! While eternal ages roll!
