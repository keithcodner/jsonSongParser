[Verse 1] 
‘Tis the promise of God full salvation to give unto him who on Jesus, His Son, will believe.


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.


[Verse 3] 
Though the pathway be lonely and dangerous too, surely Jesus is able to carry me through.


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.


[Verse 5] 
Many loved ones have I in yon heavenly throng, they are safe now in glory, and this is their song:


[Verse 6] 
Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.


[Verse 7] 
There are prophets and kings in that throng I behold, and they sing while they march through the streets of pure gold:


[Verse 8] 
Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.


[Verse 9] 
There’s a part in that chorus for you and for me, and the theme of our praises for ever will be:


[Verse 10] 
Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.
