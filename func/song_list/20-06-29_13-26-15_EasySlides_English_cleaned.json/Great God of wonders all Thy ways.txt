[Verse 1] 
Great God of wonders, all Thy ways are matchless, godlike and divine; but the fair glories of Thy grace more godlike and unrivalled shine:


[Verse 2] 
Who is a pardoning God like Thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?


[Verse 3] 
Such dire offences to forgive, such guilty daring souls to spare; this is Thy grand prerogative, and none shall in the honour share:


[Verse 4] 
Who is a pardoning God like Thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?


[Verse 5] 
In wonder lost, with trembling joy, we take the pardon of our God, pardon for sins of deepest dye, a pardon sealed with Jesusâ€™ blood:


[Verse 6] 
Who is a pardoning God like Thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?


[Verse 7] 
O may this glorious matchless love, this God-like miracle of grace, teach mortal tongues, like those above, to raise this song of lofty praise:


[Verse 8] 
Who is a pardoning God like Thee? Or who has grace so rich and free?
