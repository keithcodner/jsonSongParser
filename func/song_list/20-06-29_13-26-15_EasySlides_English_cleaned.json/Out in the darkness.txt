[Verse 1] 
Out in the darkness, shadowed by sin, souls are in bondage, souls we would win. How can we win them? How show the way? Love never faileth, love is the way; love never faileth, love is the way.


[Verse 2] 
Think how the Master came from above, suffered on Calvary, breathing out love; think how He loves us, e'en when we stray. We must love others, love is the way; we must love others, love is His way.


[Verse 3] 
See, they are waiting, looking at you, furtively watching all that you do: seeming so careless, hardened and lost. Love never faileth, count not the cost; love never faileth, count not the cost.


[Verse 4] 
Love never faileth, love is pure gold; love is what Jesus came to unfold; make us more loving, Master, we pray, help us remember love is Thy way; help us remember love is Thy way.
