[Verse 1] 
O happy day! that fixed my choice on thee, my Saviour and my God! Well may this glowing heart rejoice, and tell its raptures all abroad.


[Verse 2] 
O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away; he taught me how to watch and pray, and live rejoicing every day; O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away.


[Verse 3] 
'Tis done, the work of grace is done! I am the Lord's, and he is mine! He drew me, and I followed on, glad to confess the voice divine.


[Verse 4] 
O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away; he taught me how to watch and pray, and live rejoicing every day; O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away.


[Verse 5] 
Now rest, my long-divided heart, fixed on this blissful centre, rest; nor ever from thy Lord depart, with him of every good possessed.


[Verse 6] 
O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away; he taught me how to watch and pray, and live rejoicing every day; O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away.


[Verse 7] 
High heav'n, that heard the solemn vow, that vow renewed shall daily hear; till in life's latest hour I bow, and bless in death a bond so dear.


[Verse 8] 
O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away; he taught me how to watch and pray, and live rejoicing every day; O happy day! O happy day! when Jesus washed my sins away.
