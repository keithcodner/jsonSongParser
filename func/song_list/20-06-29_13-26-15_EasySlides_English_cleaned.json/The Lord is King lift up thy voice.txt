[Verse 1] 
The Lord is King! lift up thy voice, O earth, and all ye heavens rejoice; from world to world the joy shall ring, “The Lord omnipotent is King!”


[Verse 2] 
The Lord is King! who then shall dare resist His will, distrust His care, or murmur at His wise decrees, or doubt His royal promises?


[Verse 3] 
The Lord is King! Child of the dust, the Judge of all the earth is just; holy and true are all His ways: let every creature speak His praise.


[Verse 4] 
He reigns! ye saints, exalt your strains; your God is King, your Father reigns; and He is at the Father’s side, the Man of love, the crucified.


[Verse 5] 
One Lord, one empire, all secures; He reigns, and life and death are yours, through earth and heaven one song shall ring, “The Lord omnipotent is King!”
