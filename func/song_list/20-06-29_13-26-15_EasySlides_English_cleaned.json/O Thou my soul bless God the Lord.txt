[Verse 1] 
O Thou my soul, bless God the Lord; and all that in me is be stirred up, His holy name to magnify and bless.


[Verse 2] 
Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God, and not forgetful be of all His gracious benefits He hath bestowed on thee.


[Verse 3] 
All thine iniquities who doth most graciously forgive: who thy diseases all and pains doth heal, and thee relieve.


[Verse 4] 
Who doth redeem thy life, that thou to death may’st not go down; who thee with loving-kindness doth and tender mercies crown:


[Verse 5] 
Who with abundance of good things doth satisfy thy mouth; so that, e’en as the eagle’s age, renewed is thy youth.
