[Verse 1] 
Let Your life be seen in them, May others feel Your love, Flowing out from them. Let them know You care for all, Live through them, Lord, And let them see.


[Verse 2] 
Let them see what You can do, With hearts that belong to You, Let them know the love You Pour upon Your children. Let them share the life You give, That others may truly live, Let them see, Let them know You, Lord.
