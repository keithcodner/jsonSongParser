[Verse 1] 
Beauty for ashes, life evermore, peace beyond measure; Jesus won it all. Saved out of darkness, cleansed by his blood, into his kingdom by the pow'r of God.


[Verse 2] 
He has won it, my salvation, my forgiveness, at the cross. He is healing, he's redemption for whoever would come he has won, that's the cross.


[Verse 3] 
All can take freely water of life; let all who thirst, come worship Jesus Christ.


[Verse 4] 
He has won it, my salvation, my forgiveness, at the cross. He is healing, he's redemption for whoever would come he has won, that's the cross.


[Verse 5] 
He has won it, my salvation, my forgiveness, at the cross. He is healing, he's redemption for whoever would come he has won, for in him is the life that destroyed sin and death and he broke ev'ry chain for the bound and oppressed. For in him is the life that destroyed sin and death and he broke ev'ry chain for the bound and oppressed. He's alive, he's alive.


[Verse 6] 
He has won it, my salvation, my forgiveness, at the cross. He is healing, he's redemption for whoever would come he has won, that's the cross.


[Verse 7] 
He has won it, my salvation, my forgiveness at the cross. He is healing, he's redemption for whoever would come he has won, that's the cross. That's the cross. Jesus won it all.


[Verse 8] 
He has won it, my salvation, my forgiveness, at the cross. He is healing, he's redemption for whoever would come he has won, that's the cross.
