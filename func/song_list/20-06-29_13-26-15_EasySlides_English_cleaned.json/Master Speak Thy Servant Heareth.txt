[Verse 1] 
Master, speak! Thy servant heareth, Longing for Thy gracious word, Longing for Thy voice that cheereth; Master, let it now be heard. I am listening, Lord, for Thee; What hast Thou to say to me?


[Verse 2] 
Speak to me by name, O Master, Let me know it is to me; Speak, that I may follow faster, With a step more firm and free, Where the Shepherd leads the flock In the shadow of the rock.


[Verse 3] 
Master, speak! though least and lowest, Let me not unheard depart; Master, speak! for O Thou knowest All the yearning of my heart, Knowest all its truest need; Speak and make me blessed indeed.


[Verse 4] 
Master, speak! and make me ready, When Thy voice is truly heard, With obedience glad and steady Still to follow every word. I am listening, Lord, for Thee; Master, speak! O speak to me!
