[Verse 1] 
Onward, christian soldiers, Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before! Christ, the royal Master, Leads against the foe; Forward into battle, See, His banners go!


[Verse 2] 
Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.


[Verse 3] 
At the name of Jesus Satan's host doth flee; On then, Christian soldiers, On to victory! Hell's foundations quiver At the shout of praise; Brothers, lift your voices; Loud your anthems raise:


[Verse 4] 
Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.


[Verse 5] 
Like a mighty army Moves the church of God: Brothers we are treading Where the saints have trod. We are not divided, All one body we, One in hope and doctrine, One in charity.


[Verse 6] 
Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.


[Verse 7] 
Crowns and thrones may perish, Kingdoms rise and wane, But the church of Jesus Constant will remain; Gates of hell can never 'Gainst that church prevail; We have Christ's own promise, And that cannot fail:


[Verse 8] 
Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.


[Verse 9] 
Onward, then, ye people! Join our happy throng; Blend with ours your voices In the triumph-song: Glory, laud, and honour Unto Christ the King! This through countless ages Men and angels sing:


[Verse 10] 
Onward, Christian soldiers, Marching as to war, With the cross of Jesus Going on before.
