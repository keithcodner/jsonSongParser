[Verse 1] 
Have you heard the voice of Jesus, Softly pleading with your heart, Have you felt His presence glorious, As He calls your soul apart. With a love so true and loyal, Love divine that ever flows, From a saviour righteous royal, And a crown that mercy shows.


[Verse 2] 
Have you heard the voice of mercy, Granting peace and pardon pure, Have you felt the balm of Calvary, Binding all your wounds secure. Was there ever such salvation, Was there ever care like this, See the Saviour's grief and passion, Grace and mercy's gentle kiss.
