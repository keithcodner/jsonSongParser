[Verse 1] 
I was journeying in the noontide, when His light shone o’er my road and I saw Him in that glory, saw Him, Jesus, Son of God. All around, in noonday splendour, earthly scenes lay fair and bright; but my eyes no longer see them for the glory of that light.


[Verse 2] 
I have seen the face of Jesus, tell me not of aught beside; I have heard the voice of Jesus, all my soul is satisfied.


[Verse 3] 
Others, in the summer sunshine, wearily may journey on; I have seen a light from heaven, past the brightness of the sun; light that knows no cloud, no waning, light wherein I see His face, all His love’s uncounted treasures, all the riches of His grace.


[Verse 4] 
I have seen the face of Jesus, tell me not of aught beside; I have heard the voice of Jesus, all my soul is satisfied.


[Verse 5] 
Marvel not that Christ in glory all my inmost heart hath won; not a star to cheer my darkness, but a light beyond the sun. All below lies dark and shadowed, nothing there to claim my heart, save the lonely track of sorrow where of old He walked apart.


[Verse 6] 
I have seen the face of Jesus, tell me not of aught beside; I have heard the voice of Jesus, all my soul is satisfied.


[Verse 7] 
Sinners, it was not to angels all this wondrous love was given, but to one who scorned, despised Him, scorned and hated Christ in heaven. From the lowest depths of evil, to the throne in heaven above, thus in me He told the measure of His free unbounded love.


[Verse 8] 
I have seen the face of Jesus, tell me not of aught beside; I have heard the voice of Jesus, all my soul is satisfied.
