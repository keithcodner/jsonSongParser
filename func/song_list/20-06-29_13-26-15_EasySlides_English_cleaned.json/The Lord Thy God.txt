[Verse 1] 
The Lord thy God, (The Lord thy God) In the midst of Thee, (In the midst of Thee) Is mighty (is mighty), is mighty (is mighty). The Lord thy God, (The Lord thy God) In the midst of Thee, (In the midst of Thee) Is mighty (is mighty), is mighty (is mighty).


[Verse 2] 
And I saw Him high and lifted up, With power and grace and authority, And He shall reign in the midst of Thee, For ever and ever, Amen!
