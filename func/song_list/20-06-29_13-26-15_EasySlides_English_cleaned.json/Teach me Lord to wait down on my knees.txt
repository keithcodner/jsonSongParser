[Verse 1] 
Teach me, Lord, to wait down on my knees till in Your own good time, You answer my pleas, teach me not to rely on what others do, but to wait in prayâ€™r for an answer from You. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint. Teach me, Lord, teach me, Lord, to wait.


[Verse 2] 
Teach me, Lord, to wait while hearts are aflame, let me humble my pride, and call on Your name, keep my faith renewed, my eyes on Thee, let me be on this earth what you want me to be.
