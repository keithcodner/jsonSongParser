[Verse 1] 
All for Jesus! all for Jesus! All my being's ransomed powers; all my thoughts and words and doings, all my days and all my hours.


[Verse 2] 
Let my hands perform His bidding, let my feet run in His ways, let mine eyes see Jesus only, let my lips speak forth His praise.


[Verse 3] 
Since my eyes were fixed on Jesus, I've lost sight of all beside; so enchained my spirit's vision, looking at the Crucified.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, what wonder! how amazing! Jesus, glorious King of kings, deigns to call me His beloved, lets me rest beneath His wings.
