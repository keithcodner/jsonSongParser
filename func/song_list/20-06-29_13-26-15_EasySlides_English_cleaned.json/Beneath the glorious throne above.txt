[Verse 1] 
Beneath the glorious throne above, the crystal fountain springing, - a river full of life and love, - is joy and gladness bringing.


[Verse 2] 
O fount of cleansing! flowing free, that fount is open wide to me, to me, to me, ‘tis open wide to me.


[Verse 3] 
Through all my soul its waters flow, through all my nature stealing; and deep within my heart I know the consciousness of healing.


[Verse 4] 
O fount of cleansing! flowing free, that fount is open wide to me, to me, to me, ‘tis open wide to me.


[Verse 5] 
The barren wastes are fruitful lands, the desert blooms with roses; and He, the glory of all lands, His lovely face discloses.


[Verse 6] 
O fount of cleansing! flowing free, that fount is open wide to me, to me, to me, ‘tis open wide to me.


[Verse 7] 
My sun no more goes down by day, my moon no more is waning; my feet run swift the shining way, the heavenly portals gaining.


[Verse 8] 
O fount of cleansing! flowing free, that fount is open wide to me, to me, to me, ‘tis open wide to me.
