[Verse 1] 
I love you, Lord, I worship you, I love you, Lord, always. So thankful, Lord, you saved my life, you saved my life today.


[Verse 2] 
Let me be a shining light for you, let me be a joy to you always, let me be a shining light for you, let me be a joy to you always.


[Verse 3] 
And Lord, I love to bring to you the honour due your name; just look at what you've done for me, I'll never be the same.


[Verse 4] 
Let me be a shining light for you, let me be a joy to you always, let me be a shining light for you, let me be a joy to you always.
