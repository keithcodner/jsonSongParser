[Verse 1] 
For a fresh anointing, Lord, for service come we now in Jesus’ precious name; for the blessed Pentecostal fullness, every heart with heavenly love aflame.


[Verse 2] 
Send a new touch of fire on our souls, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Touch our lips today with the living coals. Send a new touch of fire on our souls.


[Verse 3] 
Make us free to tell the gospel story; liberty in service may we have, showing forth the Saviour’s grace and glory, telling of His wondrous power to save.


[Verse 4] 
Send a new touch of fire on our souls, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Touch our lips today with the living coals. Send a new touch of fire on our souls.


[Verse 5] 
Bringing all we have in consecration as a living sacrifice for Thee; trusting for an uttermost salvation, Jesus’ precious blood our only plea.


[Verse 6] 
Send a new touch of fire on our souls, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Touch our lips today with the living coals. Send a new touch of fire on our souls.


[Verse 7] 
Let the great Refiner throughly purge us, purify our hearts like as by fire; while for all the sanctifying fullness here our waiting, longing hearts aspire.


[Verse 8] 
Send a new touch of fire on our souls, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Send it now, Lord. Touch our lips today with the living coals. Send a new touch of fire on our souls.
