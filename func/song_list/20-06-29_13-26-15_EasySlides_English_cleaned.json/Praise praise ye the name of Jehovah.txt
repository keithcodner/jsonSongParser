[Verse 1] 
Praise, praise ye the name of Jehovah, our God; declare, oh, declare ye His glories abroad; proclaim ye His mercy from nation to nation, till the uttermost islands have heard His salvation.


[Verse 2] 
For His love floweth on, free and full as a river; and His mercy endureth for ever and ever.


[Verse 3] 
Praise, praise ye the Lamb, who for sinners was slain; who went down to the grave and ascended again; and who soon shall return when these dark days are o’er, to set up His kingdom, in glory and power.


[Verse 4] 
For His love floweth on, free and full as a river; and His mercy endureth for ever and ever.


[Verse 5] 
Then the heavens and the earth and the sea shall rejoice; the field and the forest shall lift their glad voice; the sands of the desert shall flourish in green, and Lebanon’s glory be shed o’er the scene.


[Verse 6] 
For His love floweth on, free and full as a river; and His mercy endureth for ever and ever.


[Verse 7] 
Her bridal attire and her festal array, all nature shall wear on that glorious day; for her King cometh down with His people to reign, and His presence shall bless her with Eden again.


[Verse 8] 
For His love floweth on, free and full as a river; and His mercy endureth for ever and ever.
