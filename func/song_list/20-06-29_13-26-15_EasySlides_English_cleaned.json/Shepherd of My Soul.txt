[Verse 1] 
Shepherd of my soul I give you full control Wherever you may lead I will follow I have made the choice To listen for your voice Wherever you may lead I will go   Be it in a quiet pasture Or by a gentle stream The shepherd of my soul is by my side Should I face a mighty mountain Or a valley dark and deep The Shepherd of my soul will be my guide
