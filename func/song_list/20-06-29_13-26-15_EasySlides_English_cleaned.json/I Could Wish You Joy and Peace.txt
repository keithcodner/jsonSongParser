[Verse 1] 
I could wish you joy and peace To last your whole life long I could wish you sunshine Or a cheerful little song Or wish you all the happiness That the life could bring But I wish you Jesus More than anything 


[Verse 2] 
I could wish you leaves of gold And may your path be smooth I could wish you treasures And may all your dreams come true Or wish you all the paradise And everyday be spring 'cause when I wish Jesus I wish you everything
