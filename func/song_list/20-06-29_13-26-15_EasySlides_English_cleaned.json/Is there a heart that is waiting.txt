[Verse 1] 
Is there a heart that is waiting, longing for pardon today? Hear the glad message proclaiming, Jesus is passing this way.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus is passing this way, this way, today, Jesus is passing this way, is passing this way today.


[Verse 3] 
Is there a heart that has wandered? Come with thy burden today; mercy is tenderly pleading, Jesus is passing this way.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus is passing this way, this way, today, Jesus is passing this way, is passing this way today.


[Verse 5] 
Is there a heart that is broken? Weary and sighing for rest? Come to the arms of thy Saviour, pillow thy head on His breast.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus is passing this way, this way, today, Jesus is passing this way, is passing this way today.


[Verse 7] 
Come to thy only Redeemer, come to His infinite love; come to the gate that is leading homeward to mansions above.


[Verse 8] 
Jesus is passing this way, this way, today, Jesus is passing this way, is passing this way today.
