[Verse 1] 
A ruler once came to Jesus by night, to ask Him the way of salvation and light; the Master made answer in words true and plain: “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 2] 
“Ye must be born again!” “Ye must be born again!”. I verily, verily, say unto you, “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 3] 
Ye children of men, attend to the word so solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord; and let not this message to you be in vain, “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 4] 
“Ye must be born again!” “Ye must be born again!”. I verily, verily, say unto you, “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 5] 
O ye who would enter that glorious rest and sing with the ransomed the song of the blest, the life everlasting if ye would obtain, “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 6] 
“Ye must be born again!” “Ye must be born again!”. I verily, verily, say unto you, “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 7] 
A dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see, at the beautiful gates may be watching for thee; then list to the note of this solemn refrain: “Ye must be born again!” 


[Verse 8] 
“Ye must be born again!” “Ye must be born again!”. I verily, verily, say unto you, “Ye must be born again!”
