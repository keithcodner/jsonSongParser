[Verse 1] 
O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home.


[Verse 2] 
Under the shadow of Thy throne Thy saints have dwelt secure; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defence is sure.


[Verse 3] 
Before the hills in order stood, Or earth received her frame, From everlasting Thou art God, To endless years the same.


[Verse 4] 
A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone, Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun.


[Verse 5] 
Time, like an ever-rolling stream, Bears all its sons away; They fly forgotten, as a dream Dies at the opening day.


[Verse 6] 
O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Be Thou our guard while troubles last, And our eternal home.
