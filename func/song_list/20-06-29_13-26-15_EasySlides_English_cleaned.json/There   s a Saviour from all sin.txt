[Verse 1] 
There’s a Saviour from all sin; if you only let Him in to your heart, He there will reign, while you trust Him. He will put the evil out, save from every fear and doubt, and you’ll soon begin to shout, “Hallelujah!”


[Verse 2] 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Jesus is my Saviour King, He does full salvation bring, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Now with heart and voice I sing Hallelujah!


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is a wondrous name, now and evermore the same. He can cleanse from every stain, only trust Him. He will fill your soul with joy, and your talents will employ, Satan’s kingdom to destroy. Hallelujah!


[Verse 4] 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Jesus is my Saviour King, He does full salvation bring, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Now with heart and voice I sing Hallelujah!


[Verse 5] 
If from every sin you part, and let Christ have all your heart, you need fear no fiery dart, while you trust Him. For while Jesus reigns within, you are proof against all sin, and His perfect peace you win, Hallelujah!


[Verse 6] 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Jesus is my Saviour King, He does full salvation bring, Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Now with heart and voice I sing Hallelujah!
