[Verse 1] 
There is no love like the love of Jesus; never to fade or fall, till into the fold of the house of God He has gathered us all.


[Verse 2] 
Jesus’ love! precious love! Boundless, and pure, and free; oh, turn to that love, weary wandering soul, Jesus pleadeth for thee!


[Verse 3] 
There is no heart like the heart of Jesus, filled with a tender love; no throb nor throe that our hearts can know, but He feels it above.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus’ love! precious love! Boundless, and pure, and free; oh, turn to that love, weary wandering soul, Jesus pleadeth for thee!


[Verse 5] 
There is no eye like the eye of Jesus, piercing so far away; ne’er out of the sight of its tender light can the wanderer stray.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus’ love! precious love! Boundless, and pure, and free; oh, turn to that love, weary wandering soul, Jesus pleadeth for thee!


[Verse 7] 
There is no voice like the voice of Jesus, tender and sweet its chime; like musical ring of a flowing spring in the bright summer time.


[Verse 8] 
Jesus’ love! precious love! Boundless, and pure, and free; oh, turn to that love, weary wandering soul, Jesus pleadeth for thee!


[Verse 9] 
Oh, let us hark to the voice of Jesus! Then we shall never roam; and we shall rest on His loving breast, all the way to our heavenly home.


[Verse 10] 
Jesus’ love! precious love! Boundless, and pure, and free; oh, turn to that love, weary wandering soul, Jesus pleadeth for thee!
