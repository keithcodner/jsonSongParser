Granting the sinner life and peace, granting the captive sweet release, shedding His blood to make us free, merciful Man of Calvary!


[Verse 4] 
That Man of Calvary has won my heart from me, and died to set me free, blest Man of Calvary!

Giving the gifts obtained for men, pouring out love beyond our ken, giving us spotless purity, bountiful Man of Calvary!


[Verse 6] 
That Man of Calvary has won my heart from me, and died to set me free, blest Man of Calvary!


[Verse 7] 
Comfort of all my earthly way, Jesus, I’ll meet Thee some sweet day; centre of glory Thee I’ll see, wonderful Man of Calvary!

That Man of Calvary has won my heart from me, and died to set me free, blest Man of Calvary!
