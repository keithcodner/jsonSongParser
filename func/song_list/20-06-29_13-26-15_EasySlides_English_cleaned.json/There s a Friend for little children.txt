[Verse 1] 
There's a Friend for little children above the bright blue sky, a Friend that never changes, whose love will never die: unlike our friends by nature, who change with changing years, this Friend is always worthy the precious name He bears.


[Verse 2] 
There's a rest for little children above the bright blue sky, who love the blessed Saviour, and to His Father cry: a rest from every trouble, from sin and danger free; there every little pilgrim shall rest eternally.


[Verse 3] 
There's a home for little children above the bright blue sky, where Jesus reigns in glory, a home of peace and joy: no home on earth is like it, or can with it compare, for every one is happy, nor can be happier there.


[Verse 4] 
There's a crown for little children above the bright blue sky, and all who look to Jesus shall wear it by and by: a crown of brightest glory, which He shall sure bestow on all who love the Saviour, and walk with Him below.


[Verse 5] 
There's a song for little children above the bright blue sky, and a harp of sweetest music for their hymn of victory; and all above is treasured and found in Christ alone; O come, dear little children, that all may be your own!
