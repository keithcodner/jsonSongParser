[Verse 1] 
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame; and I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain. 


[Verse 2] 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown.


[Verse 3] 
O, the old rugged cross, so despised by the world, has a wondrous attraction for me; for the dear Lamb of God left His glory above to bear it to dark Calvary. 


[Verse 4] 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown.


[Verse 5] 
In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, a wondrous beauty I see; for 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died to pardon and sanctify me.


[Verse 6] 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown.


[Verse 7] 
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, its shame and reproach gladly bear; then He'll call me some day to my home far away, when His glory for ever I'll share.


[Verse 8] 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown.
