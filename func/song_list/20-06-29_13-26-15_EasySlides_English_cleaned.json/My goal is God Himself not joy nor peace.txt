[Verse 1] 
My goal is God Himself, not joy nor peace, nor even blessing, but Himself, my God: â€˜tis His to lead me there, not mine, but His At any cost, dear Lord, by any road!


[Verse 2] 
So faith bounds forward to its goal in God, and love can trust her Lord to lead her there; upheld by Him my soul is following hard, till God has full fulfilled my deepest prayer.


[Verse 3] 
No matter if the way be sometimes dark, no matter though the cost be oft-times great, He knows how I best shall reach the mark, the way that leads to Him must needs be strait.


[Verse 4] 
One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay; one thing I do, I press toward my Lord: my God, my glory here, from day to day, and in the glory there my Great Reward.
