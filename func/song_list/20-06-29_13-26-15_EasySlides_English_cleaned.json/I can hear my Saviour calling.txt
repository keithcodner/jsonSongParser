[Verse 1] 
I can hear my Saviour calling, I can hear my Saviour calling, I can hear my Saviour calling, “Take thy cross and follow, follow Me!”


[Verse 2] 
Where He leads me I will follow, where He leads me I will follow, where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.


[Verse 3] 
Though He lead through fiery trials, though He lead through fiery trials,though He lead through fiery trials,I'll go with Him, with Him, all the way.


[Verse 4] 
Where He leads me I will follow, where He leads me I will follow, where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.


[Verse 5] 
He will give me grace and glory, He will give me grace and glory, He will give me grace and glory, and go with me, with me all the way.


[Verse 6] 
Where He leads me I will follow, where He leads me I will follow, where He leads me I will follow, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.
