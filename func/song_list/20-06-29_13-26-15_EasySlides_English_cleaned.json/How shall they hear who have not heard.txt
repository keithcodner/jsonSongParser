[Verse 1] 
How shall they hear, who have not heard news of a Lord who loved and came? nor known His reconciling word, nor learned to trust the Saviour's name?


[Verse 2] 
To all the world, to every place, neighbours and friends and far-off lands, preach the good news of saving grace; go while the great commission stands.


[Verse 3] 
“Whom shall I send?” Who hears the call, constant in prayer, through toil and pain, telling of one who died for all, to bring a lost world home again?


[Verse 4] 
“Lord, here am I,” Your fire impart to this poor cold self-centred soul; touch but my lips, my hands, my heart, and make a world for Christ my goal.


[Verse 5] 
Spirit of love, within us move: Spirit of truth, in power come down! So shall they hear and find and prove Christ is their life, their joy, their crown.
