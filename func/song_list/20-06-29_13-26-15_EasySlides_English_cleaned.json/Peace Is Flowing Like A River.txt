[Verse 1] 
Peace is flowing like a river, Flowing out through you and me, Spreading out into the desert, Setting all the captives free. Let it flow through me, Let it flow through me, Let the mighty peace of God Flow out through me. Let it flow through me, Let it flow through me, Let the mighty peace of God Flow out through me.   Love is flowing ... (etc.)   Joy is flowing ... (etc.)   Faith is flowing ... (etc.)   Hope is flowing ... (etc.)
