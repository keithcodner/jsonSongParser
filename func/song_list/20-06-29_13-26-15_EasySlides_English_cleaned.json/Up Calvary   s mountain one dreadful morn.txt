[Verse 1] 
Up Calvary’s mountain, one dreadful morn, walked Christ my Saviour, weary and worn; facing for sinners death on the cross, that He might save them from endless loss.


[Verse 2] 
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer! Seems now I see Him on Calvary’s tree wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading blind and unheeding, dying for me!


[Verse 3] 
“Father forgive them!” thus did He pray, e’en while His life-blood flowed fast away; praying for sinners while in such woe - no one but Jesus ever loved so.


[Verse 4] 
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer! Seems now I see Him on Calvary’s tree wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading blind and unheeding, dying for me!


[Verse 5] 
O how I love Him, Saviour and Friend! How can my praises ever find end! Through years unnumbered on heaven’s shore, my tongue shall praise Him for evermore.


[Verse 6] 
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer! Seems now I see Him on Calvary’s tree wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading blind and unheeding, dying for me!
