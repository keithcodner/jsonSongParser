[Verse 1] 
Waiting for angry words to sear my soul Knowing I don't deserve another chance Suddenly the kindest words I've ever heard, come flooding from God's heart


[Verse 2] 
It's your kindness that leads us To repentance O Lord Knowing that You love us, no matter what we do Make us want to love You too It's your kindness that leads us To repentance O Lord Knowing that You love us, no matter what we do Make us want to love You too


[Verse 3] 
No excuse no one to blame no way to hide The eyes of God have found my failures Found my pain, He understands my weaknesses and knows my shame but His heart never leaves me.


[Verse 4] 
If you are for us, who can be against us? You gave us everything, Even Your only Son
