[Verse 1] 
Hark, my soul! it is the Lord; ‘tis thy Saviour, hear His word: Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee, “Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou Me?”


[Verse 2] 
“I delivered thee, when bound, and, when bleeding, healed thy wound; sought thee wandering, set thee right, turned thy darkness into light.”


[Verse 3] 
“Can a woman’s tender care cease toward the child she bare? Yes! she may forgetful be, yet will I remember thee.”


[Verse 4] 
“Mine is an unchanging love, higher than the heights above, deeper than the depths beneath, free and faithful, strong as death.”


[Verse 5] 
“Thou shalt see My glory soon, when the work of grace is done: partner of My throne shalt be; - say, poor sinner, lov’st thou Me?”
