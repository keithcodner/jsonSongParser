[Verse 1] 
All you that pass by, to Jesus draw nigh: to you is it nothing that Jesus should die? Your ransom and peace, your surety He is: come, see if there ever was sorrow like His.


[Verse 2] 
For what you have done His blood must atone: the Father hath stricken for you His dear Son. The Lord, in the day of his anger, did lay your sins on the Lamb, and He bore them away.


[Verse 3] 
He answered for all: O come at His call, and low at His cross with astonishment fall! But lift up your eyes at Jesus’ cries: impassive, He suffers; immortal, He dies.


[Verse 4] 
He dies to atone for sins not His own; your debt He hath paid, and your work He hath done. You all may receive the peace He did leave, who made intercession - “My Father, forgive!”


[Verse 5] 
For you and for me He prayed on the tree: the prayer is accepted, the sinner is free. That sinner am I, who on Jesus rely, and come for the pardon God will not deny.


[Verse 6] 
My pardon I claim; for a sinner I am, a sinner believing in Jesus’ name. He purchased the grace which now I embrace: Father, Thou know’st He hath died in my place.


[Verse 7] 
His death is my plea; my Advocate see, and hear the blood speak that hath answered for me. My ransom He was when He bled on the cross; and by losing His life He hath carried my cause.
