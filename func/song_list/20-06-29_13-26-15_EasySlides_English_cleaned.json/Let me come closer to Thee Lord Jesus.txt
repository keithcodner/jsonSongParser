[Verse 1] 
Let me come closer to Thee, Lord Jesus, oh, closer day by day! Let me lean harder on Thee, Lord Jesus, yes, harder all the way.


[Verse 2] 
Let me show forth Thy beauty, Lord Jesus, like the sunshine on the hills; oh, let my lips pour forth Thy sweetness in joyous, sparkling rills!


[Verse 3] 
Yes, like a fountain, precious Lord Jesus, make me and let me be; keep me and use me daily, Lord Jesus, for Thee, for only Thee.


[Verse 4] 
In all my heart and will, Lord Jesus, be altogether King! Make me a loyal subject, Lord Jesus, to Thee in everything.


[Verse 5] 
Thirsting and hungering for Thee, Lord Jesus, with blessed hunger here, looking for home on Zionâ€™s mountain, no thirst, no hunger there.
