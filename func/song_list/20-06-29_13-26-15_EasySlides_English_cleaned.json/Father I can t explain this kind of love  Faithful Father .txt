[Verse 1] 
Father I can't explain this kind of love This kind of grace I know I still break your heart And yet you run to welcome me


[Verse 2] 
This is my song of praise to you For who you are and all that you do From the moment my life began You have been faithful


[Verse 3] 
Father I love the way you hold me close And call my name And I know when my life is through My heart will find its way in you


[Verse 4] 
This is my song of praise to you For who you are and all that you do From the moment my life began You have been faithful
