[Verse 1] 
I’ve wandered far away from God, now I’m coming home; the paths of sin too long I’ve trod, Lord, I’m coming home.


[Verse 2] 
Coming home, coming home, never more to roam. To Thine open arms of love, Lord, I’m coming home!


[Verse 3] 
I’ve wasted many precious years;now I’m coming home; I now repent with bitter tears, Lord, I’m coming home.


[Verse 4] 
Coming home, coming home, never more to roam. To Thine open arms of love, Lord, I’m coming home!


[Verse 5] 
I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord! now I’m coming home; I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word. Lord, I’m coming home.


[Verse 6] 
Coming home, coming home, never more to roam. To Thine open arms of love, Lord, I’m coming home!


[Verse 7] 
My soul is sick, my heart is sore; now I’m coming home; My strength renew, my hope restore! Lord, I’m coming home.


[Verse 8] 
Coming home, coming home, never more to roam. To Thine open arms of love, Lord, I’m coming home!
