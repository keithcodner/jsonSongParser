[Verse 1] 
There's a call comes ringing o'er the restless wave, send the light! send the light! There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save, send the light! send the light!


[Verse 2] 
Send the light the blessed gospel light. Let it shine from shore to shore! Send the light! and let its radiant beams light the world for evermore.


[Verse 3] 
We have heard the Macedonian call today, and a golden offering at the cross we lay.


[Verse 4] 
Send the light the blessed gospel light. Let it shine from shore to shore! Send the light! and let its radiant beams light the world for evermore.


[Verse 5] 
Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound, and a Christ-like spirit everywhere be found.


[Verse 6] 
Send the light the blessed gospel light. Let it shine from shore to shore! Send the light! and let its radiant beams light the world for evermore.


[Verse 7] 
Let us not grow weary in the work of love, let us gather jewels for a crown above.


[Verse 8] 
Send the light the blessed gospel light. Let it shine from shore to shore! Send the light! and let its radiant beams light the world for evermore.
