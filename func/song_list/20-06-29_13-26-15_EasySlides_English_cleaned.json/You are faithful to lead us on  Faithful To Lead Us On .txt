[Verse 1] 
You are faithful to lead us on More than able to keep us strong Walking before us, You light our way Faithful to lead us on 


[Verse 2] 
You've brought us out of the wilderness Guiding us home by your hand Now you're preparing a place for us We'll go, We'll stand


[Verse 3] 
Called out of darkness into your light chosen to lift up your name We'll see your kingdom established here Come rule, come reign
