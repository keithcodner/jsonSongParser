[Verse 1] 
Here from the world we turn, Jesus to seek; here may His loving voice graciously speak! Jesus, our dearest Friend, while at Thy feet we bend oh, let Thy smile descend! 'Tis Thee we seek.


[Verse 2] 
Come, Holy Comforter, presence divine, now in our longing hearts gloriously shine! Oh, for Thy mighty power! Oh, for a blessed shower, filling this hallowed hour with joy divine!


[Verse 3] 
Saviour, Thy work revive! Here may we see those who are dead in sin quickened by Thee; come, to our heart's delight, make every burden light, cheer Thou our waiting sight, we long for Thee.
