[Verse 1] 
O Lord My Heart Longs To Be A Habitation fit for thee A place where, peace reigns, and love can flourish My heart where you can feel at home.   O Lord I want to be like You My words to speak the words You do My hands to, stretch forth, in healing others My feet to carry the Good News


[Verse 2] 
For You are God, You're the way, You're the truth and You're the Life King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Prince of Peace Lord Jesus Christ And by Yourâ€¦Shed Blood, the Great Redeemer, You saved my soul you paid the price.
