[Verse 1] 
Behold Me standing at the door, and hear Me pleading evermore with gentle voice - Oh, heart of sin, may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 2] 
Behold Me standing at the door! And hear Me pleading evermore: say, weary heart, opprest with sin, may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 3] 
I bore the cruel thorns for thee, I waited long and patiently: say, weary heart, opprest with sin, may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 4] 
Behold Me standing at the door! And hear Me pleading evermore: say, weary heart, opprest with sin, may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 5] 
I would not plead with thee in vain; remember all My grief and pain! I died to ransom thee from sin: may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 6] 
Behold Me standing at the door! And hear Me pleading evermore: say, weary heart, opprest with sin, may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 7] 
I bring thee joy from heaven above, I bring thee pardon, peace, and love: say, weary heart, opprest with sin, may I come in? may I come in?


[Verse 8] 
Behold Me standing at the door! And hear Me pleading evermore: say, weary heart, opprest with sin, may I come in? may I come in?
