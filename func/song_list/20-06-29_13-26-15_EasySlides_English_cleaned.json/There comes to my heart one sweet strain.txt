[Verse 1] 
There comes to my heart one sweet strain, a glad and a joyous refrain, I sing it again and again, sweet peace, the gift of God's love.


[Verse 2] 
Peace, peace, sweet peace, wonderful gift from above; oh, wonderful, wonderful peace, sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.


[Verse 3] 
By Christ on the cross peace was made, my debt by His death was all paid, no other foundation is laid for peace, the gift of God's love.


[Verse 4] 
Peace, peace, sweet peace, wonderful gift from above; oh, wonderful, wonderful peace, sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.


[Verse 5] 
When Jesus as Lord I had crowned, my heart with this peace did abound, in Him the rich blessing I found, sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.


[Verse 6] 
Peace, peace, sweet peace, wonderful gift from above; oh, wonderful, wonderful peace, sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.


[Verse 7] 
In Jesus for peace I abide, and as I keep close to His side, there’s nothing but peace doth betide sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.


[Verse 8] 
Peace, peace, sweet peace, wonderful gift from above; oh, wonderful, wonderful peace, sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.
