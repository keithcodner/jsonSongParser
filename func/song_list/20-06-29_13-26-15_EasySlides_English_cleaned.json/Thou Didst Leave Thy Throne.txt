[Verse 1] 
Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown, When Thou camest to earth for me; But in Bethlehem's home there was found no room For Thy holy nativity: O come to my heart, Lord Jesus! There is room in my heart for Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang, Proclaiming Thy royal degree; But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth, And in great humility, O come to my heart, Lord Jesus! There is room in my heart for Thee.


[Verse 3] 
The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest, In the shade of the cedar tree; But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God, In the deserts of Galilee. O come to my heart, Lord Jesus! There is room in my heart for Thee.


[Verse 4] 
Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word That should set Thy children free; But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn, They bore Thee to Calvary. O come to my heart, Lord Jesus! Thy cross is my only plea.


[Verse 5] 
When heaven's arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing, At Thy coming to victory, Let Thy voice call me home, saying, 'Yet there is room, There is room at My side for thee.' And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus, When Thou comest and callest for me.
