[Verse 1] 
Thank you for your mercy, thank you for your grace; thank you for your blood that's made a way to come into your presence and glorify your name. Lord, I stand amazed at what I see.


[Verse 2] 
Great is your mercy toward me, your loving kindness toward me, your tender mercies I see day after day. For ever faithful to me, always providing for me, great is your mercy toward me great is your grace.


[Verse 3] 
Your promises are ageless, your love will never end, for a thousand generations your covenant will stand; showing grace and mercy to those who fear your name, establishing your righteousness and praise.


[Verse 4] 
Great is your mercy toward me, your loving kindness toward me, your tender mercies I see day after day. For ever faithful to me, always providing for me, great is your mercy toward me great is your grace.
