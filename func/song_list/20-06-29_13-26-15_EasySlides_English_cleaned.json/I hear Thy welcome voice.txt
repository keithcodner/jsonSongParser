Though coming weak and vile, Thou dost my strength assure; Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse, till spotless all, and pure.


[Verse 4] 
I am coming, Lord! coming now to Thee! Wash me, cleanse me in the blood that flowed on Calvary.

‘Tis Jesus calls me on to perfect faith and love, to perfect hope, and peace, and trust, for earth and heaven above.


[Verse 6] 
I am coming, Lord! coming now to Thee! Wash me, cleanse me in the blood that flowed on Calvary.
