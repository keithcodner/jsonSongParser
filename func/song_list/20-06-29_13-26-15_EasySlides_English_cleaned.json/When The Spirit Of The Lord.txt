[Verse 1] 
When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart I will sing as David sang. When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart I will sing as David sang. I will sing, I will sing, I will sing as David sang. I will sing, I will sing, I will sing as David sang. When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart I will clap ... dance ... praise ... (etc.)
