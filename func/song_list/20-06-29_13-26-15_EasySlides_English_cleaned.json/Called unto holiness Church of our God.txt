[Verse 1] 
Called unto holiness, Church of our God, purchase of Jesus, redeemed by His blood; called from the world and its idols to flee, called from the bondage of sin to be free.


[Verse 2] 
“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our watchword and song, “Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re marching along: sing it, shout it, loud and long, “Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.


[Verse 3] 
Called unto holiness, children of light, walking with Jesus in garments of white; raiment unsullied, nor tarnished with sin, God’s Holy Spirit abiding within.


[Verse 4] 
“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our watchword and song, “Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re marching along: sing it, shout it, loud and long, “Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.


[Verse 5] 
Called unto holiness, praise His dear name, this blessed secret to faith now made plain. Not our own righteousness, but Christ within, living and reigning, and saving from sin.


[Verse 6] 
“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our watchword and song, “Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re marching along: sing it, shout it, loud and long, “Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.


[Verse 7] 
Called unto holiness, glorious thought! Up from the wilderness wanderings brought out from the shadows and darkness of night into the Canaan of perfect delight.


[Verse 8] 
“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our watchword and song, “Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re marching along: sing it, shout it, loud and long, “Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.


[Verse 9] 
“Called unto holiness,” Bride of the Lamb, waiting the Bridegroom’s returning again; lift up your heads, for the day draweth near when in His beauty the King shall appear.


[Verse 10] 
“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our watchword and song, “Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re marching along: sing it, shout it, loud and long, “Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.
