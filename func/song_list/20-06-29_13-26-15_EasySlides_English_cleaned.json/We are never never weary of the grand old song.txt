[Verse 1] 
We are never, never weary of the grand old song; glory to God, hallelujah! We can sing it loud as ever, with our faith more strong: glory to God, hallelujah!


[Verse 2] 
Oh, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, for the way is growing bright and our souls are on the wing; we are going by and by to the palace of a King! glory to God, hallelujah!


[Verse 3] 
We are going to a palace that is built of gold; where the King in all His splendour we shall soon behold.


[Verse 4] 
Oh, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, for the way is growing bright and our souls are on the wing; we are going by and by to the palace of a King! glory to God, hallelujah!


[Verse 5] 
There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad new song; there we’ll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood-washed throng. 


[Verse 6] 
Oh, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, for the way is growing bright and our souls are on the wing; we are going by and by to the palace of a King! glory to God, hallelujah!
