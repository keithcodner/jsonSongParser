[Verse 1] 
My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour Divine! Now hear me while I pray; take all my guilt away; oh, let me from this day be wholly Thine!


[Verse 2] 
May Thy rich grace impart strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire; as Thou hast died for me, oh, may my love to Thee pure, warm, and changeless be, a living fire!


[Verse 3] 
While life’s dark maze I tread, and griefs around me spread, be Thou my Guide; bid darkness turn to day, wipe sorrow’s tears away, nor let me ever stray from Thee aside.


[Verse 4] 
When ends life’s transient dream, when death’s cold, sullen stream shall o’er me roll, blest Saviour, then, in love, fear and distrust remove, oh, bear me safe above, a ransomed soul!
