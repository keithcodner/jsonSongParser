[Verse 1] 
There shall be showers of blessing: this is the promise of love; there shall be seasons refreshing, sent from the Saviour above.


[Verse 2] 
Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need; mercy drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.


[Verse 3] 
There shall be showers of blessing, precious reviving again; over the hills and the valleys, sound of abundance of rain.


[Verse 4] 
Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need; mercy drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.


[Verse 5] 
There shall be showers of blessing: Send them upon us, O Lord! Grant to us now a refreshing; come, and now honour Thy Word.


[Verse 6] 
Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need; mercy drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.


[Verse 7] 
There shall be showers of blessing, oh, that to-day they might fall, now, as to God we're confessing, now as on Jesus we call!


[Verse 8] 
Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need; mercy drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.


[Verse 9] 
There shall be showers of blessing, if we but trust and obey; there shall be seasons refreshing, if we let God have His way.


[Verse 10] 
Showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need; mercy drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.
