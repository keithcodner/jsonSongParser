[Verse 1] 
Come, Thou burning Spirit, come! Lo! we stretch our hands to Thee, from the Father to the Son, let us now Thy glory see.


[Verse 2] 
Come, oh come, Great Spirit, come! Let the mighty deed be done, satisfy our souls’ desire, see us waiting for the fire, waiting, waiting, see us waiting for the fire.


[Verse 3] 
On the altar now we lay soul and body, mind and will; all the evil passions slay, come and every corner fill.


[Verse 4] 
Now the sacrifice we make, though as dear as a right eye, for our blessed Saviour’s sake, who for us did bleed and die.


[Verse 5] 
Now, by faith, the gift I claim, bought for me by blood Divine; through the all-prevailing Name, all the promises are mine.
