[Verse 1] 
Jesus has loved me, wonderful Saviour! Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why, came He to rescue sinners all worthless, my heart He conquered, for Him I would die.


[Verse 2] 
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, the One I adore. Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, and praise ever-more.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus has saved me, wonderful Saviour! Jesus has saved me, I cannot tell how; all that I know is He was my ransom, dying on Calvary with thorns on His brow.


[Verse 4] 
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, the One I adore. Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, and praise ever-more.


[Verse 5] 
Jesus will lead me, wonderful Saviour! Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where; but I will follow, through joy or sorrow, sunshine or tempest, sweet peace or despair.


[Verse 6] 
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, the One I adore. Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, and praise ever-more.


[Verse 7] 
Jesus will crown me, wonderful Saviour! Jesus will crown me, I cannot tell when; white throne of splendour hail I with gladness, crowned â€˜mid the plaudits of angels and men.


[Verse 8] 
Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, the One I adore. Glory to Jesus, wonderful Saviour! Glory to Jesus, and praise ever-more.
