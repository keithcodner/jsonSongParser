[Verse 1] 
There will never be a sweeter story, story of the Saviour’s love divine; love that brought Him from the realms of glory, just to save a sinful soul like mine.


[Verse 2] 
Isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful, wonderful, wonderful? oh, isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful it is to me.


[Verse 3] 
Boundless as the universe around me, reaching to the farthest soul away; saving, keeping love it was that found me, that is why my heart can truly say:


[Verse 4] 
Isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful, wonderful, wonderful? oh, isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful it is to me.


[Verse 5] 
Love beyond our human comprehending, love of God in Christ how can it be! This will be my theme and never ending, great redeeming love of Calvary.


[Verse 6] 
Isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful, wonderful, wonderful? oh, isn’t the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful it is to me.
