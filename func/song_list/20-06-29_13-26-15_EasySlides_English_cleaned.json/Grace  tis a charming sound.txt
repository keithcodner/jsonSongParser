[Verse 1] 
Grace! - ‘tis a charming sound, harmonious to the ear. Heaven with the echo shall resound, and all the earth shall hear.


[Verse 2] 
Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.


[Verse 3] 
‘Twas grace that wrote my name in life’s eternal book; ‘twas grace that gave me to the Lamb, who all my sorrows took.


[Verse 4] 
Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.


[Verse 5] 
Grace taught my wandering feet to tread the heavenly road, and new supplies each hour I meet, while pressing on to God.


[Verse 6] 
Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.


[Verse 7] 
Grace taught my soul to pray, and made mine eyes o’er; ‘tis grace has kept me to this day, and will not let me go.


[Verse 8] 
Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.


[Verse 9] 
Oh, let Thy grace inspire my soul with strength divine! May all my powers to Thee aspire, and all my days be Thine.


[Verse 10] 
Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.
