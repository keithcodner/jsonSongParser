[Verse 1] 
I have a Shepherd, One I love so well; how He has blessed me tongue can never tell; on the Cross He suffered, shed His blood and died, that I might ever in His love confide.


[Verse 2] 
Following Jesus, ever day by day, nothing can harm me when He leads the way; darkness or sunshine, whate’er befall, Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.


[Verse 3] 
Pastures abundant doth His hand provide, still waters flowing ever at my side, goodness and mercy follow on my track, with such a Shepherd nothing can I lack.


[Verse 4] 
Following Jesus, ever day by day, nothing can harm me when He leads the way; darkness or sunshine, whate’er befall, Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.


[Verse 5] 
When I would wander from the path astray, then He will draw me back into the way; in the darkest valley I need fear no ill, for He, my Shepherd, will be with me still.


[Verse 6] 
Following Jesus, ever day by day, nothing can harm me when He leads the way; darkness or sunshine, whate’er befall, Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.


[Verse 7] 
When labour’s ended and the journey done, then He will lead me safely to my home; there I shall dwell in rapture sure and sweet, with all the loved ones gathered round His feet.


[Verse 8] 
Following Jesus, ever day by day, nothing can harm me when He leads the way; darkness or sunshine, whate’er befall, Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.
