[Verse 1] 
“Far above all” is our Saviour enthroned; crowned is the Lamb who for sinners atoned, living for ever, to list to our call, God hath exalted Him “far above all.”


[Verse 2] 
Far above all, far above all!. Jesus the Crucified, “far above all!” Low at His footstool adoring we fall, God hath exalted Him “far above all.”


[Verse 3] 
When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves, seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves; looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand, tread we the billows as safe as on land.


[Verse 4] 
Far above all, far above all!. Jesus the Crucified, “far above all!” Low at His footstool adoring we fall, God hath exalted Him “far above all.”


[Verse 5] 
High are the cities that dare our assault, strong are the barriers that call us to halt; march we on fearless, and down they must fall, vanquished by faith in Him “far above all.”


[Verse 6] 
Far above all, far above all!. Jesus the Crucified, “far above all!” Low at His footstool adoring we fall, God hath exalted Him “far above all.”


[Verse 7] 
His is the kingdom from pole unto pole, “Far above all” while the ages shall roll. With Him the victors, who followed His call, share in His royalty “far above all.”


[Verse 8] 
Far above all, far above all!. Jesus the Crucified, “far above all!” Low at His footstool adoring we fall, God hath exalted Him “far above all.”
