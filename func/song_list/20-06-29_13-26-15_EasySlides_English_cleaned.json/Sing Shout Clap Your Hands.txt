[Verse 1] 
Sing, shout, clap your hands, Give praise unto your Maker, Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. Sing, shout, clap your hands, Give praise unto your Maker, For the Lord, He is Almighty God.   This is the day of celebration, This is the day to rejoice, REJOICE! The Lord, our God, is our Deliverer, so let's just praise His name.
