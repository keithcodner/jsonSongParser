[Verse 1] 
Search me, O God! my actions try, and let my life appear, as seen by Thine all-searching eye, to mine my ways make clear.


[Verse 2] 
Search all my sense, and know my heart, who only canst make known, and let the deep, the hidden part to me be fully shown.


[Verse 3] 
Throw light into the darkened cells where passion reigns within; quicken my conscience till it feels the loathsomeness of sin.


[Verse 4] 
Search all my thoughts, the secret springs, the motives that control; the chambers where polluted things hold empire o'er the soul.


[Verse 5] 
Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast its holy light through all, and I by grace am brought at last before Thy face to fall.


[Verse 6] 
Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee what now I feebly prove, that God alone in Christ can be unutterable love.
