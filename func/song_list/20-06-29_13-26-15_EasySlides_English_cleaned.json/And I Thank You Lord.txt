[Verse 1] 
And I thank you Lord For the trials that come my way In that way I can grow each day As I let you lead And I thank you Lord For the patience those trials bring In that process of growing I can learn to care


[Verse 2] 
But it goes against the way I am To put my human nature down And let the spirit Take control of all I do Cause when those trials come My human nature shouts the things to do And God's soft prompting Can be easily ignored


[Verse 3] 
Yes I thank you Lord For the vic-t'ry those trials bring In surrender of ev'rything Life is still worthwhile And I thank you Lord That when ev'rything's put in place In that way I can see your face And it's there you belong


[Verse 4] 
But it goes against the way I am To put my human nature down And let the spirit Take control of all I do Cause when those trials come My human nature shouts the things to do And God's soft prompting Can be easily ignored
