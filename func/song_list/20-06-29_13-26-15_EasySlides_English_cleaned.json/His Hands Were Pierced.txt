[Verse 1] 
His hands were pierced, The hands that made The mountain range and everglade; That washed the stains of sin away And changed earth's darkness into day.


[Verse 2] 
His feet were pierced, The feet that trod The furthest shining star of God; And left their imprint deep and clear On ev'ry winding pathway here.


[Verse 3] 
His heart was pierced, The heart that burned To comfort every heart that yearned, And from it came a cleansing flood, The river of redeeming blood.


[Verse 4] 
His hands and feet And heart, all three Were pierced for me on Calvary, And here and now to him I bring My hands, feet, heart, an offering.
