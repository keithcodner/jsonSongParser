[Verse 1] 
I’ll praise my Maker while I’ve breath, and when my voice is lost in death, praise shall employ my nobler powers; my days of praise shall ne’er be past, while life, and thought, and being last, or immortality endures.


[Verse 2] 
Happy the man whose hopes rely on Israel’s God! He made the sky, and earth, and seas, with all their train: His truth for ever stands secure; He saves the oppressed, He feeds the poor, and none shall find His promise vain.


[Verse 3] 
The Lord gives eyesight to the blind; the Lord supports the fainting mind; He sends the labouring conscience peace; He helps the stranger in distress, the widow and the fatherless, and grants the prisoner sweet release.


[Verse 4] 
I’ll praise Him while He lends me breath, and when my voice is lost in death, praise shall employ my nobler powers; my days of praise shall ne’er be past, while life, and thought, and being last, or immortality endures.
