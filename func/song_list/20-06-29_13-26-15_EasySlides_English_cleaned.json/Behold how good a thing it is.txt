[Verse 1] 
Behold, how good a thing it is, and how becoming well. Together such as brethren are in unity to dwell!


[Verse 2] 
Like precious ointment on the head, that down the beard did flow, even Aaron’s beard, and to the skirts did of his garments go.


[Verse 3] 
As Hermon’s dew, the dew that doth on Sion’ hills descend: for there the blessing God commands, life that shall never end.
