[Verse 1] 
Jesus take me now, Fill me with Your holy spirit, Make me strong in You, And give me strength to do Your will Listen to my prayer Listen to my prayer Sitting here unworthy, Crying out to You   I've broken Your heart, Take my life as a sacrifice It's all I have, It's all I can give Jesus take me now, Fill me with Your holy spirit, Make me strong in You, And give me strength to do Your will Bridge   For I am willing, To take up my cross. Whatever it takes, I will worship and follow You.


[Verse 2] 
 Jesus take me now, Fill me with Your holy spirit, Make me strong in You, And give me strength to do Your will
