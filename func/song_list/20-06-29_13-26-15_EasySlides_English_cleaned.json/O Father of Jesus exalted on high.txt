[Verse 1] 
O Father of Jesus, exalted on high, in sense of our need would we humbly draw nigh, low down in Thy presence ourselves would abase, and open our hearts to the inflow of grace.


[Verse 2] 
Here find Thy rest, Saviour most blessed! By Thy Holy Spirit, come, dwell in each breast!


[Verse 3] 
Our Father in heaven, by Thy Spirit, we pray, come, inwardly strengthen Thy servants to-day! Let Christ, in His love, make our hearts His abode, that we may be filled with the fullness of God!


[Verse 4] 
Here find Thy rest, Saviour most blessed! By Thy Holy Spirit, come, dwell in each breast!


[Verse 5] 
Thy love, in its length and its breadth and its height, its infinite depth, and its measureless might, how feebly we know, and how poorly display! Oh, shed it abroad in us fully to-day!


[Verse 6] 
Here find Thy rest, Saviour most blessed! By Thy Holy Spirit, come, dwell in each breast!


[Verse 7] 
Our prayer it is large, and our quest it is deep, yet surely Thy promise of grace Thou wilt keep. Exceeding abundantly, past all we pray, our need Thou canst meet if we trust and obey.


[Verse 8] 
Here find Thy rest, Saviour most blessed! By Thy Holy Spirit, come, dwell in each breast!
