[Verse 1] 
Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too; what is there left for me to do? Simply to cease from struggling and strife, simply to walk in newness of life. Glory be to God.


[Verse 2] 
Risen with Christ, my glorious Head, holiness now the pathway I tread, beautiful thought, while walking therein; He that is dead is freed from sin. Glory be to God.


[Verse 3] 
Living with Christ, who dieth no more, following Christ, who goeth before; I am from bondage utterly freed, reckoning self as dead indeed. Glory be to God.


[Verse 4] 
Living for Christ, my members I yield, servants to God, for evermore sealed, not under law, I'm now under grace, sin is dethroned and Christ takes its place. Glory be to God.


[Verse 5] 
Growing in Christ; no more shall be named things of which now I'm truly ashamed, fruit unto holiness will I bear, life evermore, the end I shall share. Glory be to God.
