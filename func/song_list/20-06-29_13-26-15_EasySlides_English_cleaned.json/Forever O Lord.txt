[Verse 1] 
Forever, O Lord, your word is settled in heaven Your faithfulness, Lord, continues to all generations Your covenant magnified, exalted along with your holy name Rejoicing in promises, I meditate on all your righteous ways   I lift up my hands and praise the power of your commands Forever, O Lord, your word shall stand Forever, O Lord, your word shall stand
