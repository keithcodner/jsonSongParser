[Verse 1] 
There’s not a Friend like the lowly Jesus, no, not one! no, not one! none else could heal all our soul’s diseases, no, not one! no, not one!


[Verse 2] 
Jesus knows all about our struggles, He will guide till the day is done, there’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus, no, not one! no, not one!


[Verse 3] 
No friend like Him is so high and holy, and yet no friend is so meek and lowly.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus knows all about our struggles, He will guide till the day is done, there’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus, no, not one! no, not one!


[Verse 5] 
There’s not an hour that He is not near us, no night so dark but His love can cheer us.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus knows all about our struggles, He will guide till the day is done, there’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus, no, not one! no, not one!


[Verse 7] 
Did ever saint find this friend forsake him? Or sinner find that He would not take him?


[Verse 8] 
Jesus knows all about our struggles, He will guide till the day is done, there’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus, no, not one! no, not one!


[Verse 9] 
Was e’er a gift like the Saviour given? Will He refuse us a home in heaven?


[Verse 10] 
Jesus knows all about our struggles, He will guide till the day is done, there’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus, no, not one! no, not one!
