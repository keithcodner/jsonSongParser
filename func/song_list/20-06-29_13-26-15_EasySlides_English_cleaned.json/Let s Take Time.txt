[Verse 1] 
Let's Take Time Let's take time to wait upon the Lord, Let's take time to listen to His voice, Unless the Lord builds the house, we labour in vain, So let's take time to wait upon the Lord.


[Verse 2] 
Let's take time to wait upon the Lord, Let's take time to feed upon His Word, Unless the Lord builds the house, we labour in vain, So let's take time to wait upon the Lord.
