[Verse 1] 
According to Thy gracious word, in meek humility, this will I do, my dying Lord: I will remember Thee.


[Verse 2] 
Thy body, broken for my sake, my bread from heaven shall be; Thy testamental cup I take, and thus remember Thee.


[Verse 3] 
Gethsemane can I forget? Or there Thy conflict see, Thine agony and bloody sweat, and not remember Thee?


[Verse 4] 
When to the cross I turn my eyes, and rest on Calvary, O Lamb of God, my sacrifice, I must remember Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Remember Thee, and all Thy pains, and all Thy love to me; yea, while a breath, a pulse remains, will I remember Thee.


[Verse 6] 
And when these failing lips grow dumb, and mind and memory flee, when Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come then, Lord, remember me.
