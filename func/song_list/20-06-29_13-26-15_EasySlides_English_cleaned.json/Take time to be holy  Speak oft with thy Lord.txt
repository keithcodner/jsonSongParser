[Verse 1] 
Take time to be holy! Speak oft with thy Lord; abide in Him always, and feed on His Word. Make friends of Godâ€™s children; help those who are weak; forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.


[Verse 2] 
Take time to be holy; the world rushes on; spend much time in secret with Jesus alone; by looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be; thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.


[Verse 3] 
Take time to be holy! Be calm in thy soul; each thought and each temper beneath His control, thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love, thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.
