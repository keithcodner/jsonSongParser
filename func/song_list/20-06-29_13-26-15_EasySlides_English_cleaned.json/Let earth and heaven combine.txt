[Verse 1] 
Let earth and heaven combine, angels and men agree, to praise in songs divine, the incarnate Deity, our God contracted to a span, incomprehensibly made man.


[Verse 2] 
He laid His glory by, He wrapped Him in our clay; unmarked by human eye, the latent Godhead lay; infant of days He here became, and bore the mild Immanuel’s Name.


[Verse 3] 
Unsearchable the love that hath the Saviour brought; the grace is far above or man or angel’s thought: suffice for us that God, we know, our God, is manifest below.


[Verse 4] 
He deigns in flesh to appear, widest extremes to join; to bring our vileness near, and make us all divine: and we the life of God shall know, for God is manifest below.


[Verse 5] 
Made perfect by His love, and sanctified by grace, we shall from earth remove, and see His glorious face: then shall His love be fully showed, and man shall then be lost in God.
