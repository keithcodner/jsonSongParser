[Verse 1] 
Our God is a Great Big God Our God is a Great Big God Our God is a Great Big God And He holds us in His hands


[Verse 2] 
He's higher than a skyscraper He's deeper than a submarine He's wider than the universe And beyond my wildest dreams And He's known me And He's loved me Since before the world began How wonderful to be a part Of God's amazing plan!!!!
