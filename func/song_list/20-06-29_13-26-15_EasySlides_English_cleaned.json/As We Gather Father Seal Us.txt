[Verse 1] 
As we gather, Father, seal us in the love that knows no fear. Draw us, heal us, reconcile us, may there be a place of refuge here.


[Verse 2] 
Who share one living bread, one Father's love, one Saviour's grace, one Spirit's breath; one holy communion.


[Verse 3] 
No more outcasts, no more strangers, all dividing walls are down. Here is love that redefines us, dignifies the least and lowest one.


[Verse 4] 
Who share one living bread, one Father's love, one Saviour's grace, one Spirit's breath; one holy communion.


[Verse 5] 
Source of joy, belonging, friendship, form your family likeness here. Father, Son and Holy Spirit, that the world may know our God is near.


[Verse 6] 
Who share one living bread, one Father's love, one Saviour's grace, one Spirit's breath; one holy communion.
