[Verse 1] 
Days are filled with sorrow and care, hearts are lonely and drear; burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.


[Verse 2] 
Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Calvary, Calvary, burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.


[Verse 3] 
Cast your care on Jesus today, leave your worry and fear; burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.


[Verse 4] 
Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Calvary, Calvary, burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.


[Verse 5] 
Troubled soul, the Saviour can see every heartache and tear; burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.


[Verse 6] 
Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Calvary, Calvary, burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near.
