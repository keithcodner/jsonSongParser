[Verse 1] 
Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore; Mortals, give thanks, and sing, And triumph ever more:


[Verse 2] 
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; Rejoice! Again I say: rejoice!


[Verse 3] 
Jesus the Saviour reigns, The God of truth and love; When He had purged our stains, He took His seat above:


[Verse 4] 
His kingdom cannot fail, He rules o'er earth and heaven; The keys of death and hell Are to our Jesus given:


[Verse 5] 
He sits at God's right hand Till all His foes submit, And bow to His command, And fall beneath His feet:


[Verse 6] 
Rejoice in glorious hope; Jesus the Judge shall come, And take His servants up To their eternal home:


[Verse 7] 
We soon shall hear the archangel's voice; The trump of God shall sound: rejoice!
