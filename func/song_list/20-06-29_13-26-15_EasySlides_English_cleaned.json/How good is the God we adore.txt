[Verse 1] 
How good is the God we adore! Our faithful, unchangeable friend: His love is as great as His power and knows neither measure nor end.


[Verse 2] 
For Christ is the first and the last; His Spirit will guide us safe home: we’ll praise Him for all that is past and trust Him for all that’s to come.
