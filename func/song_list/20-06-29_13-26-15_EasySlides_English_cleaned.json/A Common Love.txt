[Verse 1] 
A common love for each other A common gift to the Saviour A common bond holding us to the Lord A common strength when we are weary A common hope for tomorrow A common joy in the truth of God's word


[Verse 2] 
In his family we can meet each other's needs We can light each one's path We can bear each one's grief As his children, we can comfort each care We can build each one's faith We can work, we can share


[Verse 3] 
A common love for each other A common gift to the Saviour A common bond holding us to the Lord A common strength when we are weary A common hope for tomorrow A common joy in the truth of God's word


[Verse 4] 
In his family, all the love that we show All the help that we give All the life we bestow As his children, they're an offering we make Not expecting return, Just a gift for his sake


[Verse 5] 
A common love for each other A common gift to the Saviour A common bond holding us to the Lord A common strength when we are weary A common hope for tomorrow A common joy in the truth of God's word
