[Verse 1] 
Glory to Thee; Thou Son of God most High, all praise to Thee! Glory to Thee, enthroned above the sky, who died for me; high on Thy throne, Thine ear, Lord Jesus bend as grateful hearts now to Thyself ascend.


[Verse 2] 
Deep were Thy sorrows, Lord, when heaven frowned - Gethsemane! Bloodlike Thy sweat, Lord, falling to the ground so heavily; dark was the night, but heaven was darker still, O Christ my God, is this the Father’s will?


[Verse 3] 
Thorns wreathed Thy brow when hanging on the tree, man’s cruelty! Why lavish love like this, O Lord, on me? Thou lovest me! Would that my soul could understand its length, its breadth, depth, height, and everlasting strength!


[Verse 4] 
Thy precious blood was freely shed for me on Calvary to save me from a lost eternity; glory to Thee! Nor death, nor hell, nor things below - above can sever me from Thy eternal love.


[Verse 5] 
Like shoreless seas, Thy love can know no bound; Thou lovest me! Deep, vast, immense, unfathomed, Lord, profound, Lord, I love Thee! And when above, my crown is at Thy feet, I’ll praise Thee still for Calvary’s mercy seat.
