[Verse 1] 
Just one of us can put a thousand to flight And two of us can send the legions fleeing Just one of us can put a thousand to flight And two of us can rout evil principalities


[Verse 2] 
O there are many of us here Exalting the name of the Lord And in His name we declare Our victory in spiritual war We bind the powers of the air By wielding the Word as our sword


[Verse 3] 
Over princes and powers Jesus gave authority We raise our voice with a shout He has won the victory
