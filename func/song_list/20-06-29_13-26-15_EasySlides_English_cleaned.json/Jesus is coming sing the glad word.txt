[Verse 1] 
Jesus is coming, sing the glad word, coming for those He redeemed by His blood, coming to reign as the glorified Lord: Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 2] 
Jesus is coming, is coming again, Jesus is coming again. Shout the glad tidings o’er mountain and plain Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 3] 
Jesus is coming! The dead shall arise; loved ones shall meet in a joyful surprise, caught up together to Him in the skies: Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 4] 
Jesus is coming, is coming again, Jesus is coming again. Shout the glad tidings o’er mountain and plain Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 5] 
Jesus is coming, His saints to release, coming to give to the warring earth peace! Sinning, and sighing, and sorrow shall cease: Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 6] 
Jesus is coming, is coming again, Jesus is coming again. Shout the glad tidings o’er mountain and plain Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 7] 
Jesus is coming! The promise is true! Who are the chosen, the faithful, the few, waiting and watching, prepared for review? Jesus is coming again!


[Verse 8] 
Jesus is coming, is coming again, Jesus is coming again. Shout the glad tidings o’er mountain and plain Jesus is coming again!
