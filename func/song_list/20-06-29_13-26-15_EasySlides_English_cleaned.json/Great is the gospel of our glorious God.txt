[Verse 1] 
Great is the gospel of our glorious God, where mercy met the anger of God’s rod; a penalty was paid and pardon bought, and sinners lost at last to Him were brought:


[Verse 2] 
O let the praises of my heart be Thine, for Christ has died that I may call Him mine, that I may sing with those who dwell above, adoring, praising Jesus, King of love.


[Verse 3] 
Great is the mystery of godliness, great is the work of God’s own holiness; it moves my soul, and causes me to long for greater joys than to the earth belong:


[Verse 4] 
O let the praises of my heart be Thine, for Christ has died that I may call Him mine, that I may sing with those who dwell above, adoring, praising Jesus, King of love.


[Verse 5] 
The Spirit vindicated Christ our Lord, and angels sang with joy and sweet accord; the nations heard, a dark world flamed with light when Jesus rose in glory and in might:


[Verse 6] 
O let the praises of my heart be Thine, for Christ has died that I may call Him mine, that I may sing with those who dwell above, adoring, praising Jesus, King of love.
