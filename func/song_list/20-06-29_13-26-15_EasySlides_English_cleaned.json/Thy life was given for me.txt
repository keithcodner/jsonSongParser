[Verse 1] 
Thy life was given for me, Thy blood, O Lord, was shed, that I might ransomed be, and quickened from the dead: Thy life, Thy life was given for me; what have I given for Thee?


[Verse 2] 
Thy Father's home of light, Thy rainbow-circled throne, were left for earthly night, for wanderings sad and lone; yea, all, yea, all was left for me; have I left aught for Thee?


[Verse 3] 
Thou, Lord, hast borne for me more than my tongue can tell of bitterest agony, to rescue me from hell; Thou sufferedst all for me, for me; what have I borne for Thee?


[Verse 4] 
Oh, let my life be given, my years for Thee be spent; world-fetters all be riven, and joy with suffering blent. To Thee, to Thee my all I bring, my Saviour and my King!   Repeat last two lines of each verse
