[Verse 1] 
Once I was bound by sin's galling fetters; chained like a slave, I struggled in vain. But I received a glorious freedom when Jesus broke my fetters in twain.


[Verse 2] 
Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom! No more in chains of sin I repine! Jesus, the glorious Emancipator! Now and forever He shall be mine.


[Verse 3] 
Freedom from all the carnal affections; freedom from envy, hatred, and strife; freedom from vain and worldly ambitions; freedom from all that saddened my life.


[Verse 4] 
Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom! No more in chains of sin I repine! Jesus, the glorious Emancipator! Now and forever He shall be mine.


[Verse 5] 
Freedom from pride and all sinful follies; freedom from love and glitter of gold; freedom from evil temper and anger, glorious freedom, rapture untold!


[Verse 6] 
Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom! No more in chains of sin I repine! Jesus, the glorious Emancipator! Now and forever He shall be mine.


[Verse 7] 
Freedom from fear with all of its torments, freedom from care with all of its pain; freedom in Christ, my blessed Redeemer, He who has rent my fetters in twain.


[Verse 8] 
Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom! No more in chains of sin I repine! Jesus, the glorious Emancipator! Now and forever He shall be mine.
