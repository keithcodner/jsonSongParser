[Verse 1] 
We want to love, Lord, Teach us Your love, Send us Your spirit, From heaven above, We come before You, Seeking Your face, Come fill our hearts now, With truth and grace.


[Verse 2] 
Riding high, riding high, On the wings of love we'll fly, And we know Your love can bring all together, Riding high, riding high, With Your love we'll reach the sky, Let us be as one in the body of Your son, our Lord.
