[Verse 1] 
How firm a foundation, you saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent word; what more can he say than to you he has said, you who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?


[Verse 2] 
Fear not, I am with you, O be not dismayed; for I am your God, and will still give you aid; I'll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand, upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.


[Verse 3] 
In every condition, in sickness, in health, in poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth; at home and abroad, on the land, on the sea, as your days may demand shall your strength ever be.


[Verse 4] 
When through the deep waters I call you to go, the rivers of grief shall not you overflow; for I will be with you in trouble to bless, and sanctify to you your deepest distress.


[Verse 5] 
When through fiery trials your pathway shall lie, my grace all-sufficient shall be your supply; the flame shall not hurt you, my only design your dross to consume and your gold to refine.


[Verse 6] 
The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose I will not, I cannot, desert to its foes; that soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake, I never will leave, I will never forsake.
