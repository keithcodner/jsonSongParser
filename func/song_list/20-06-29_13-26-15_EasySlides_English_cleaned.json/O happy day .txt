[Verse 1] 
O happy day! (O happy day!) O happy day! (O happy day!) when Jesus washed (when Jesus washed), when Jesus washed (when Jesus washed), when Jesus washed (when Jesus washed), he washed my sins away. (O happy day!) (O happy day!). (Repeat)


[Verse 2] 
He taught me how to watch, watch and pray, watch and pray; and live rejoicing ev'ry, ev'ry day, ev'ry day.
