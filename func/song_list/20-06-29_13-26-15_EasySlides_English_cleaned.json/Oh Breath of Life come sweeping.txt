[Verse 1] 
Oh! Breath of Life, come sweeping through us, revive Thy Church with life and power; oh! Breath of Life, come, cleanse, renew us, and fit Thy Church to meet this hour.


[Verse 2] 
Oh! Wind of God, come bend us, break us, till humbly we confess our need; then in Thy tenderness remake us, revive, restore; for this we plead.


[Verse 3] 
Oh! Breath of Love, come breathe within us, renewing thought and will and heart; come, Love of Christ, afresh to win us, revive Thy Church in every part.


[Verse 4] 
Revive us, Lord! Is zeal abating while harvest fields are vast and white? Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting, equip Thy Church to spread the light.
