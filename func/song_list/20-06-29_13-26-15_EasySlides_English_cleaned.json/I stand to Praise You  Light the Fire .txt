[Verse 1] 
I stand to praise You But I fall on my knees The spirit is willing But my flesh is so weak


[Verse 2] 
Light the fire (light the fire) In my soul (in my weary soul) Fan the flames (fan the flames) Make me whole (make my spirit whole) Lord you know (Lord you know) Just where I've been (where I've been) So light the fire in my heart again.


[Verse 3] 
I feel your arms around me As the power of your healing begins. Your Spirit moves through me Like a mighty rushing wind!


[Verse 4] 
Light the fire (light the fire) In my soul (in my weary soul) Fan the flames (fan the flames) Make me whole (make my spirit whole) Lord you know (Lord you know) Just where I've been (where I've been) So light the fire in my heart again.
