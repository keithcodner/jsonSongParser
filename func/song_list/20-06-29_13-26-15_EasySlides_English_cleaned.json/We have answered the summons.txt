[Verse 1] 
We have answered the summons and joined in the fight; we are soldiers in battle for God and the right; with our Captain to lead us we fear not the foe, for His strength is sufficient to carry us through.


[Verse 2] 
We shall win! we shall win! We shall win! we shall win! We will trust! We will pray! And battle for the Lord our King.


[Verse 3] 
Though the night may be dark and the fight may be long, yet the tumult of warfare shall change into song when the strongholds of darkness and evil shall fall, and our Lord shall be Conqueror and reign over all.


[Verse 4] 
We shall win! we shall win! We shall win! we shall win! We will trust! We will pray! And battle for the Lord our King.


[Verse 5] 
See the millions that stray from the way of the Lord, caring nought for His wrath and defying His word, casting scorn on our Saviour, despising His blood! Will you not, then, enlist in the battle for God?


[Verse 6] 
We shall win! we shall win! We shall win! we shall win! We will trust! We will pray! And battle for the Lord our King.


[Verse 7] 
Come and join in the fight! There are foes you must meet; there are rebels and scoffers to bring to His feet; there is work for you all, and your strength is secure; there's a crown for the victor, and victory is sure.


[Verse 8] 
We shall win! we shall win! We shall win! we shall win! We will trust! We will pray! And battle for the Lord our King.
