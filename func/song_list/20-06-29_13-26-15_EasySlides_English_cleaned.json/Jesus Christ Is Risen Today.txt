[Verse 1] 
Jesus Christ is risen today; Hallelujah! Our triumphant holy day; Hallelujah! Who did once upon the cross; Hallelujah! Suffer to redeem our loss; Hallelujah!


[Verse 2] 
Hymns of praise then let us sing; Hallelujah! Unto Christ our heavenly King; Hallelujah! Who endured the cross and grave; Hallelujah! Sinners to redeem and save: Hallelujah!


[Verse 3] 
But the pains which He endured; Hallelujah! Our salvation have procured; Hallelujah! Now in heaven above He's King; Hallelujah! Where the angels ever sing: Hallelujah!
