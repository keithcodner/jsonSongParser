[Verse 1] 
Visit us, Lord, with revival! Stricken with coldness and death, where is our hope of survival save in Thy life-giving breath?


[Verse 2] 
Lord, send us revival! Let it begin now in me! Gladly dethroning each rival, yield I my heart unto Thee.


[Verse 3] 
The world, in its proud exultation, lust of the flesh and the eye, bent on the soul's desecration, God and His people defy.


[Verse 4] 
Lord, send us revival! Let it begin now in me! Gladly dethroning each rival, yield I my heart unto Thee.


[Verse 5] 
Turning aside into byways, letting their ardour grow cold, many are leaving the highways trod by our fathers of old.


[Verse 6] 
Lord, send us revival! Let it begin now in me! Gladly dethroning each rival, yield I my heart unto Thee.


[Verse 7] 
Oh, for the breath of the Spirit! Oh, for the might of His sword, leading us on to inherit all that in Jesus is stored!


[Verse 8] 
Lord, send us revival! Let it begin now in me! Gladly dethroning each rival, yield I my heart unto Thee.


[Verse 9] 
Surely 'tis time for revival; surely soon dawneth the day; soon shall we hail its arrival, chasing the shadows away!


[Verse 10] 
Lord, send us revival! Let it begin now in me! Gladly dethroning each rival, yield I my heart unto Thee.
