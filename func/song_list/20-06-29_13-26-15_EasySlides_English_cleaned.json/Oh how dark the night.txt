[Verse 1] 
Oh, how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round! Oh, how deep the woe my Saviour found when his blessed sunshine flooded all my soul, bade the darkness vanish: made me whole!


[Verse 2] 
All the way to Calvary, he went for me, he went for me, he went for me; all the way to Calvary he went for me, he died to set me free.


[Verse 3] 
Tremblingly a sinner bow'd before his face, naught I knew of pardon - nor his grace; heard a voice so tender, 'Cease thy wild regret - I have bought thy pardon, paid thy debt.'


[Verse 4] 
All the way to Calvary, he went for me, he went for me, he went for me; all the way to Calvary he went for me, he died to set me free.


[Verse 5] 
Oh, 'twas wondrous love the Saviour show'd for me, when he left his throne for Calvary, when he trod the winepress, trod it all alone: praise his name for ever - make it known!


[Verse 6] 
All the way to Calvary, he went for me, he went for me, he went for me; all the way to Calvary he went for me, he died to set me free.
