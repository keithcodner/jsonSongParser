[Verse 1] 
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His word, just to rest upon His promise, just to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”


[Verse 2] 
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him; how I've proved Him o'er and o'er, Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more.


[Verse 3] 
O how sweet to trust in Jesus, just to trust His cleansing blood; just in simple faith to plunge me, 'neath the healing, cleansing flood.


[Verse 4] 
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him; how I've proved Him o'er and o'er, Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more.


[Verse 5] 
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus, just from sin and self to cease; just from Jesus simply taking life and rest and joy and peace.


[Verse 6] 
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him; how I've proved Him o'er and o'er, Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more.


[Verse 7] 
I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee, precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend; and I know that Thou art with me, wilt be with me to the end.


[Verse 8] 
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him; how I've proved Him o'er and o'er, Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! O for grace to trust Him more.
