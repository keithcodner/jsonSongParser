[Verse 1] 
With broken heart and contrite sigh, a trembling sinner, Lord, I cry; Thy pardoning grace is rich and free: O God, be merciful to me!


[Verse 2] 
I smite upon my troubled breast, with deep and conscious guilt oppressed; Christ and His Cross my only plea: O God, be merciful to me!


[Verse 3] 
Far off I stand with tearful eyes, nor dare uplift them to the skies; but Thou dost all my anguish see: O God, be merciful to me!


[Verse 4] 
Nor alms, nor deeds that I have done, can for a single sin atone: to Calvary alone I flee; O God, be merciful to me!


[Verse 5] 
And when, redeemed from sin and hell, with all the ransomed throng I dwell, my raptured song shall ever be: God has been merciful to me! (Repeat last line of each verse)
