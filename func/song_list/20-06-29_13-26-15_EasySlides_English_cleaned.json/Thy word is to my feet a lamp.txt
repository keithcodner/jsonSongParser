[Verse 1] 
Thy word is to my feet a lamp, and to my path a light. I sworn have, and I will perform, to keep Thy judgements right.


[Verse 2] 
I am with sore affliction even overwhelmed, O Lord: In mercy raise and quicken me, according to Thy word.


[Verse 3] 
The free-will-offerings of my mouth accept, I Thee beseech: and unto me Thy servant, Lord, Thy judgements clearly teach.


[Verse 4] 
Though still my soul be in my hand, Thy laws Iâ€™ll not forget. I erred not from them, though for me the wicked snares did set.


[Verse 5] 
I of Thy testimonies have above all things made choice, to be my heritage for aye; for they my heart rejoice.


[Verse 6] 
I carefully inclined have my heart still to attend; that I Thy statutes may perform alway unto the end.
