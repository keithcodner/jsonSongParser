Lord You're my shepherd, I shall not want You make me lie down in peace You lead me beside the still waters of life My soul is restored at Your feet


[Verse 3] 
God is my refuge and my strength A present help in time of need He is my fortress my deliverer My Father, my friend indeed

Yes tho' I walk through the valley of death I will not fear any harm Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me And You will not leave me alone

God is my refuge and my strength A present help in time of need He is my fortress my deliverer My Father, my friend indeed
