[Verse 1] 
Gone from my heart the world with all its charm; now through the blood I’m saved from sin’s alarm; down at the cross my heart is bending low, the precious blood of Jesus washes white as snow.


[Verse 2] 
I love Him, I love Him, because He first loved me, and purchased my salvation on Mount Calvary.


[Verse 3] 
Once I was far away, deep down in sin, once was a slave to passions fierce within; once was afraid to meet an angry God, but now I’m cleansed from every stain through Jesus’ blood.


[Verse 4] 
I love Him, I love Him, because He first loved me, and purchased my salvation on Mount Calvary.


[Verse 5] 
Once I was bound, but now I am set free, once I was blind, but now the light I see; once I was dead, but now in God I live, and tell the world around the peace that He doth give.


[Verse 6] 
I love Him, I love Him, because He first loved me, and purchased my salvation on Mount Calvary.
