[Verse 1] 
Not all the blood of beasts, on Jewish altars slain, could give the guilty conscience peace, or wash away the stain.


[Verse 2] 
But Christ, the heavenly Lamb, takes all our sins away; a sacrifice of nobler name and richer blood than they.


[Verse 3] 
My faith would lay her hand on that dear head of Thine, while like a penitent I stand, and there confess my sin.


[Verse 4] 
My soul looks back to see the burdens Thou didst bear, when hanging on the cursed tree, and knows her guilt was there.


[Verse 5] 
Believing, we rejoice to see the curse remove; we bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, and sing His bleeding love.
