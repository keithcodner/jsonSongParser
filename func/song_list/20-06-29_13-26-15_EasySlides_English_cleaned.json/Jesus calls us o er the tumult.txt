[Verse 1] 
Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult of our life's wild restless sea, day by day His sweet voice soundeth saying, “Christian, follow Me!”


[Verse 2] 
As of old, apostles heard it by the Galilean lake, turned from home and toil and kindred, leaving all for His dear sake.


[Verse 3] 
Jesus calls us from the worship of the vain world's golden store, from each idol that would keep us saying, “Christian, love Me more.”


[Verse 4] 
In our joys and in our sorrows, days of toil and hours of ease, still He calls, in cares and pleasures, “Christian, love Me more than these.”


[Verse 5] 
Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies, Saviour, may we hear Thy call, give our hearts to Thy obedience, serve and love Thee best of all.
