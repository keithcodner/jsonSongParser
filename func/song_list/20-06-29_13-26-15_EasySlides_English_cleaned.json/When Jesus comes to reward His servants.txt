[Verse 1] 
When Jesus comes to reward His servants, whether it be noon or night, faithful to Him will He find us watching, with our lamps all trimmed and bright?


[Verse 2] 
Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul’s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?


[Verse 3] 
If at the dawn of the early morning, He shall call us one by one, when to the Lord we restore our talents, will He answer thee, “Well done!”?


[Verse 4] 
Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul’s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?


[Verse 5] 
Have we been true to the trust He left us? Do we seek to do our best? If, in our hearts, there is nought condemns us, we shall have a glorious rest.


[Verse 6] 
Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul’s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?


[Verse 7] 
Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching in His glory they shall share if He should come at the dawn or midnight, will He find us watching there?


[Verse 8] 
Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul’s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?
